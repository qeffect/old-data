  <text start="198.74" dur="4.1">months here so this is all because of</text>
  <text start="201.02" dur="5.01">what has been happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="6.04">San Francisco very expensive the rent is</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="5.37">very very high and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="4.35">individuals in there because of a lot of</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="3.3">people flocking to this area but what</text>

  <text start="214.7" dur="4.5">starting to come down and individuals</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="3.96">are looking at the situation saying we</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="3.75">better get out and the according to a</text>
  <text start="221.3" dur="3.9">new poll conducted by the Bay Area</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="3.9">Council forty percent of all people</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="3.6">living in San Francisco say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="4.8">ready to ditch the city for greener</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="5.28">pastures and the number is even higher</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.71">among Millennials at forty six percent</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="5.46">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="236.36" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re worried about the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="7.85">time to ditch these high-priced condos</text>
  <text start="242.96" dur="7.26">homes and to get out right now we see</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="5.47">Obama&amp;#39;s economy which this is really</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="8.22">what it is right down that were in well</text>
  <text start="252.86" dur="7.86">it is the worst economy since post-world</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="4.89">War 2 the Federal Reserve lowered</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="5.13">interest rates to 0% making bonds and</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="5.1">interest-bearing accounts untenable for</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="5.61">retirees effectively forcing people into</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="5.93">stocks hence the stock market being so</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="5.64">high the fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet went from</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="5.17">750 billion to four point five trillion</text>
  <text start="277.1" dur="5.46">over that time frame rigging both equity</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="6.66">currency and bond markets over Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="5.55">entire eight-year term due to the</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="3.54">financial crisis drastic measures were</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="3.84">taking the transfer the wrist from the</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="4.29">banks onto the National balance sheet</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="4.86">the Obama administration underwent a</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="5.16">methodical process of deficit spending</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.86">that kept the economy artificially</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.19">afloat the side effect of this reckless</text>
  <text start="301.67" dur="6.33">spending was an additional nine trillion</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="7.859">in debt added to the Americas balance</text>
  <text start="308" dur="6.72">sheet the net result well extreme</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="4.051">failure because</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="4.95">if we just judged this on return on</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="5.88">investment as a nation we stimulated the</text>
  <text start="319.67" dur="4.38">economy with more than 13 trillion in</text>
  <text start="322.16" dur="3.66">debt and federal reserve market</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="4.47">interference and yet the Obama years</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="6.21">will forever be remembered as the only</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="5.31">administration since Hoover to not to</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="4.26">grow the economy by more than three</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="4.98">percent during his entire eight-year</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="5.21">term now keep that in the back of your</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="5.4">brain right now as we move forward here</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="6.3">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="344.21" dur="5.61">economy is ruined for many Americans</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="5.65">sixty-seven percent of low-income</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="5.28">Americans they are worried today about</text>
  <text start="353.45" dur="3.75">what what do you think they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="5.37">about their worried about hunger and</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="5.67">homelessness now those individuals who</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="5.97">are making 30,000 or less they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="6.48">worried about affording a meal every</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="4.56">single day and a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="4.23">well thirty thousand dollars why would</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.86">they be you know worrying about getting</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="4.89">food well if it&amp;#39;s a family of four</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="5.52">thirty thousand dollars doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="5.28">go that far because you take away taxes</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="4.59">take away other expenses like car</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="3.84">insurance and everything else you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="4.02">really left with a little bit of money</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="4.41">here and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re very worried about the economy</text>
  <text start="392" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re very worried about inflation</text>
  <text start="394.04" dur="5.91">because think about this for a second we</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="6.78">know that wages and salaries have been</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="7.05">declining we know that inflation on food</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="5.989">has gone up and what happens here is</text>
  <text start="407" dur="5.37">that the buying power of those dollars</text>
  <text start="409.479" dur="5.291">continually decreases making it harder</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="4.65">and harder we know that insurance has</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="3.87">gone up we know that and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="3.209">about Auto we&amp;#39;re talking about health</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="4.38">insurance we&amp;#39;re talking about all of</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="4.741">that has continually gone up and a lot</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.62">of people haven&amp;#39;t even gotten the</text>
  <text start="424.97" dur="5.759">cost-of-living raises so the situation</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="5.61">is very very dire for many of these</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="4.621">individuals and as we move forward it is</text>
  <text start="433.25" dur="3.99">just going to get worse and how do we</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="3.96">know it&amp;#39;s going to get worse well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="4.35">been blowing up bubbles for the last</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="3.87">eight to nine years right now not we but</text>
  <text start="441.59" dur="4.41">the central bank the US government</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve been blowing bubbles up to keep</text>

  <text start="448.52" dur="4.649">for the everyday person but for</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.289">themselves for the central banks and we</text>
  <text start="453.169" dur="3.81">are now seeing a housing bubble an</text>

  <text start="467.599" dur="6.241">economic bubble taking place in stock</text>
  <text start="470.569" dur="4.981">markets when market participants drive</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="3.72">stock prices above their value in</text>

  <text start="477.56" dur="4.77">valuation behavioral finance theory</text>
  <text start="480.229" dur="4.68">attributes stock market bubbles to</text>
  <text start="482.33" dur="6.899">cognitive biases that lead to groupthink</text>
  <text start="484.909" dur="7.081">and herd behavior so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="489.229" dur="5.22">right now is that the insiders the</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="4.709">central bank who&amp;#39;ve been pumping this</text>
  <text start="494.449" dur="3.661">market up they&amp;#39;ve been pumping it up</text>
  <text start="496.699" dur="3.511">making everyone think over the eight</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="3.6">nine years that this is going to last</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="4.47">forever and it&amp;#39;s going to be incredible</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="6.84">and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="7.56">insider selling it just hit a six-year</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="7.049">high as retail investors are rushing</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="6.96">into stocks when you see this happen</text>
  <text start="515.599" dur="5.521">this is a classic bubble signal to let</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="4.23">you know things are going to rapidly</text>
  <text start="521.12" dur="4.95">fall apart very very quickly when you</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="5.94">see this in the housing market it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="5.79">same exact thing where you see all those</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="4.589">builders and all those insiders who are</text>
  <text start="531.86" dur="4.44">building and buying all these different</text>
  <text start="533.959" dur="5.731">homes and stuff when they start to sell</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="5.61">and retail the mom and pop come in and</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="4.41">they purchase these homes or they think</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s a great time to flip it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="4.65">time to get in because look we waited it</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="4.11">out and we see that home prices are</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="4.35">continually rising and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="4.68">to get in we saw this back in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="4.35">to 2008 at the end when people thought</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="5.13">wow this is going to last forever let me</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="4.829">buy that one more house and now they</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="3.9">have three to four homes that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.279" dur="3.481">renting out and they thought wow this is</text>
  <text start="564.26" dur="3.87">going to increase some things are just</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="5.19">going to get better and better without</text>
  <text start="568.13" dur="4.74">any knowledge or anything showing them</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="2.879">that things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="2.52">because when you look at the corporate</text>
  <text start="573.829" dur="3.63">media what are they telling you that</text>
  <text start="575.39" dur="5.13">everything is fine and everything is</text>
  <text start="577.459" dur="5.021">getting better and when you continually</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="5.47">follow that type of logic</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="7.469">well that&amp;#39;s when you get burned in the</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="6.63">end because when you look at what is</text>
  <text start="589.949" dur="5.431">really going on you can see that things</text>
  <text start="592.62" dur="4.92">are deteriorating very very quickly you</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="4.53">can see the insiders getting out you can</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="4.59">see all those investment companies hedge</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="5.25">funds who are now trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="5.37">their homes you start to paint a picture</text>
  <text start="605.16" dur="4.619">of what is really going on and what is</text>
