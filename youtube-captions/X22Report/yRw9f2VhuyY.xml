  <text start="329.069" dur="4.861">do I think gold is gonna make huge moves</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="5.519">like the 2,000 2,500 3,000 now I think</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="5.43">gold is going to move up very very</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="5.49">slowly and why does it have to move up</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="5.97">very slowly well Trump the Patriots know</text>
  <text start="341.879" dur="5.611">if they push gold up too fast and what</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="3.359">would happen we would have everyone</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="3.929">running into gold</text>
  <text start="348.689" dur="4.681">that would create a bubble the prices</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="4.321">would skyrocket and it would be a</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="4.019">complete and utter disaster I do believe</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="4.979">they want this controlled I do believe</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="5.58">they are going to push the gold prices</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="3.81">and we know this is all manipulated we</text>
  <text start="362.969" dur="3.181">know the stock markets manipulated the</text>
  <text start="364.529" dur="3.841">unemployment numbers manipulated GDP</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="4.739">numbers emitted precious metals market</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.469">completely manipulated Trump in the</text>
  <text start="370.889" dur="3.9">Patriots they have full control over all</text>
  <text start="372.839" dur="4.591">of this right now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="4.68">slowly move the gold price up yes you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="5.039">see it move down then up move down then</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="6.81">up but they want this to look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.469" dur="5.19">natural like it&amp;#39;s moving up and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="4.89">moving up too fast</text>
  <text start="387.659" dur="6.6">this will allow players to get into the</text>
  <text start="391.169" dur="4.65">market while it&amp;#39;s still low more people</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="3.72">will start to get into the market they</text>
  <text start="395.819" dur="5.66">don&amp;#39;t want to rush so this will take</text>
  <text start="397.979" dur="5.94">quite a while while this is happening</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="6.071">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="651.69" dur="5.88">talking about establishing a interim</text>
  <text start="654.93" dur="5.67">trade deal because Trump knows if they</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="6.62">can get this together and they can put</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="6.72">this in place this will accelerate the</text>
  <text start="664.19" dur="5.77">UK where they&amp;#39;ll get out of that bumpy</text>
  <text start="667.32" dur="4.98">road period a lot faster and I believe</text>
  <text start="669.96" dur="5.25">that he wants them to get out of the</text>
  <text start="672.3" dur="7.02">bumpy road place a lot faster so other</text>
  <text start="675.21" dur="6.54">countries can see how well the UK is</text>
  <text start="679.32" dur="5.01">doing without the EU and how many trade</text>
  <text start="681.75" dur="4.8">deals they&amp;#39;re making without the EU and</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="5.04">how they are able to deal with the U</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="5.04">with the US and once other countries</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="4.92">start to see this this is going to</text>
  <text start="691.59" dur="3.97">create a domino effect among the other</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="3.88">countries</text>
  <text start="695.56" dur="5.28">and we can see how this is all starting</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="5.01">to play out and eventually once the</text>
  <text start="700.84" dur="5.76">elections are finished the gloves come</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="5.91">off with Trump the Patriots nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="4.14">holding them back they&amp;#39;re gonna get rid</text>
  <text start="709.09" dur="4.98">of all those blocks through the D class</text>
  <text start="710.74" dur="4.5">through the Criminal Investigations then</text>
  <text start="714.07" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re gonna go after the central bank</text>
  <text start="715.24" dur="5.87">and remember the central bank they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.72" dur="4.91">want to give up control they never do</text>
  <text start="721.11" dur="5.68">look what happened to other presidents</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="6.04">they tried to remove them and I do</text>
  <text start="726.79" dur="4.74">believe once Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="729.67" dur="4.32">start moving towards the central bank</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="4.26">system we&amp;#39;re going to see a fight like</text>
  <text start="733.99" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="735.79" dur="6.21">and it&amp;#39;s going to be a long battle but I</text>
  <text start="739.06" dur="4.71">believe that Trump is going to have help</text>
  <text start="742" dur="5.79">in other areas</text>
  <text start="743.77" dur="6.3">I believe that Russia China and many</text>
  <text start="747.79" dur="3.87">other countries they&amp;#39;ve been working on</text>
  <text start="750.07" dur="4.35">this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="751.66" dur="5.64">to go up against the Rothschild banking</text>
  <text start="754.42" dur="4.41">system and I think eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="757.3" dur="4.59">going to bring down the system because</text>
  <text start="758.83" dur="6.24">they know a Rothschild banking system it</text>
  <text start="761.89" dur="6.9">is not good for the world it is not good</text>
  <text start="765.07" dur="5.28">for the people it only benefits those</text>
  <text start="768.79" dur="3.57">individuals that are involved in the</text>
  <text start="770.35" dur="5.78">central bank system the rest of the</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="7.58">people they&amp;#39;re enslaved by debt and</text>
  <text start="776.13" dur="7.36">country&amp;#39;s struggle every single day and</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="5.17">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot change in the</text>
  <text start="783.49" dur="3.69">first part of this year moving into the</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="5.34">second part of this year once the u.s.</text>
  <text start="787.18" dur="5.79">MCA comes online and then you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="790.45" dur="5.13">Trump and the Patriots really start to</text>
