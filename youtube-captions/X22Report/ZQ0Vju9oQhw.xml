  <text start="137.02" dur="7.62">Australia North Korea Iran Syria Brazil</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="6.45">and here is saying that they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="5.31">deals with Greece and pretty soon you</text>
  <text start="148.6" dur="4.95">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen is like</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="6.54">Greece right now is getting debt from</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="5.58">the eurozone while China on the other</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="5.43">hand is trying to invest and bring</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="5.28">revenue into Greece to get them out of</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="4.74">this huge amount of debt we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="4.65">see how this plays out we don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="5.85">it looks like they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="6.27">moving forward with investment ideas</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="4.98">instead of just throwing and telling the</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="4.11">Greek people that you have to lay off</text>
  <text start="177.49" dur="5.04">twenty five thousand dollars to get this</text>
  <text start="179.44" dur="4.74">chunk of debt that they will not be able</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.32">to pay off because they have no revenue</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="5.76">to bring in to pay it off and this is</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="6.63">why they&amp;#39;re on their multiple amount of</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="6.69">bailouts right now because as we as they</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="5.1">told us you know a year ago they will</text>
  <text start="196.63" dur="3.96">you know everything&amp;#39;s fixed in Greece</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="3.96">they just need the one bailout there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="4.44">no problems here it&amp;#39;s the bailout look</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="4.23">say all&amp;#39;s eyes off Greece let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="4.32">back to the United States stock market</text>
  <text start="206.77" dur="4.2">everything&amp;#39;s fine just like in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="209.35" dur="6.359">when they told us they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="6.36">balance and they said it&amp;#39;s only you know</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="3.481">the capital controls are only for two</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="4.17">weeks you notice how the mainstream</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="5.19">media just drops it never mentions it</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="5.19">again but it&amp;#39;s been over what is it 120</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="5.55">days now that the capital controls are</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="6.21">still in effect in Cyprus so what they</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="5.46">tell us is always the opposite what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.41">tax they give us are always the opposite</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="4.65">actually when they give you a stat of</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="6.06">like unemployment at 7.6 just triple</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="5.4">that that&amp;#39;s the real number and what we</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="4.62">have to remember the stats that the</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="7.2">mainstream media the government are all</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="8.19">throwing at everyone are manipulated to</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="6.06">make it seem like everything is fine we</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="6.45">have proof and fact that they changed</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="6.06">the calculation for unemployment they</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="6.42">change the calculation for inflation</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="5.769">they change the calculation for GDP why</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="3.249">did they change this</text>
  <text start="270.529" dur="3.3">well they had to manipulate it because</text>
  <text start="272.299" dur="3.63">if they didn&amp;#39;t manipulate these numbers</text>
  <text start="273.829" dur="5.97">and massage them and make them look</text>
  <text start="275.929" dur="6.48">better everything would not look as good</text>
  <text start="279.799" dur="5.43">as it is and that&amp;#39;s why since GDP is</text>
  <text start="282.409" dur="5.73">going into the negative area they came</text>
  <text start="285.229" dur="4.71">out just a little while ago saying that</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="3.57">they were going to add in research and</text>
  <text start="289.939" dur="3.42">development they&amp;#39;re going to change GDP</text>
  <text start="291.709" dur="3.3">all the way back to the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="293.359" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to recalculate everything</text>
  <text start="295.009" dur="4.65">why to make it all look better instead</text>
  <text start="298.099" dur="4.56">of negative gdp they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="299.659" dur="5.91">it up into three percent of GDP why</text>
  <text start="302.659" dur="6.96">again to make everything look better</text>
  <text start="305.569" dur="6.99">than it is and again we can&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="309.619" dur="5.16">what these officials tell us words they</text>
  <text start="312.559" dur="4.86">talk a lot and what comes out of their</text>
  <text start="314.779" dur="4.38">mouth is meaningless we have to look at</text>
  <text start="317.419" dur="3.87">the actions because if we just listen to</text>
  <text start="319.159" dur="5.43">what they say and believe them and</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="6.24">believe all these statistics you&amp;#39;ll end</text>
  <text start="324.589" dur="4.59">up losing your entire wealth just like</text>
  <text start="327.529" dur="4.17">everyone thirty-eight percent of the</text>
  <text start="329.179" dur="5.4">people did in 2008 let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="5.34">back there for one second to listen to</text>
  <text start="334.579" dur="4.68">what these officials have told us what</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="4.86">their official statistics and their</text>
  <text start="339.259" dur="4.59">official numbers and their indicators</text>
  <text start="341.899" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s go back to Ben Bernanke for a</text>
  <text start="343.849" dur="6.62">second in the year of 2008 he told us</text>
  <text start="347.329" dur="6.39">that the Federal Reserve is not</text>
  <text start="350.469" dur="4.99">forecasting a recession from all the</text>
  <text start="353.719" dur="4.62">indicators and the numbers that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.459" dur="6.75">using there is no indication that</text>
  <text start="358.339" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;re a recession is coming whatsoever</text>
  <text start="362.209" dur="6.51">well although statistics and the housing</text>
  <text start="366.739" dur="4.44">market doing so well and everyone</text>
  <text start="368.719" dur="4.2">telling us that the housing market is up</text>
  <text start="371.179" dur="5.55">and it&amp;#39;s doing better than ever and</text>
  <text start="372.919" dur="6.93">housing would never come down guess what</text>
  <text start="376.729" dur="6.77">happened it all came down and guess what</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="6.45">those statistics and his economic</text>
  <text start="383.499" dur="5.2">calculations who forecasted no recession</text>
  <text start="386.299" dur="6.41">there was a recession just a couple</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="6.93">months later after he told everyone plus</text>
  <text start="392.709" dur="5.74">they told us the subprime was contained</text>
  <text start="395.629" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s not a big deal well if it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="398.449" dur="4.951">big deal why is he buying all those</text>
  <text start="401.269" dur="3.951">subprime mortgages</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="4.35">from the banks right now they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="5.47">toxic they haven&amp;#39;t stopped they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="5.46">continued to purchase them so again</text>
  <text start="410.69" dur="5.069">whatever these people say whatever</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="7.62">numbers they use it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="415.759" dur="8.13">opposite okay now talking about always</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="5.88">the opposite let&amp;#39;s go to Obamacare you</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="6.03">know that great insurance that everyone</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="4.53">wants and everyone needs and even if you</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re going to shove it down your</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="6.239">throat and if you don&amp;#39;t take it guess</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="7.431">what you got to pay us anyhow and a</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="6.331">penalty in a tax that&amp;#39;s how good it is</text>
  <text start="441.19" dur="5.11">because if we can&amp;#39;t get you to take it</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re going to tax you anyhow so really</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="4.08">you have to really think about it what</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="4.92">do they really want then that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="450.38" dur="5.94">they really just want money so they made</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.95">deals with insurance companies and this</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="4.349">is being reported all over the place</text>
  <text start="458" dur="4.44">that insurance premiums are going to</text>
  <text start="460.669" dur="4.171">skyrocket because really there is no</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="4.38">competition because this is what</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="4.079">happened in the automotive industry with</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="3.45">the insurance you have to have it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="3.541">mandatory so there&amp;#39;s no competition</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="4.769">anymore why would anyone drive their</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="4.56">prices lower they&amp;#39;ll only increase it</text>
  <text start="475.039" dur="3.931">because everybody has to have it so you</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="5.7">got to pick one of them so we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="478.97" dur="6.66">seeing the problems and if we look at</text>
  <text start="482.72" dur="5.04">the government staffers in the United</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="5.49">States government who complained already</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="4.68">and the Congress who complained already</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="3.75">and wait a minute didn&amp;#39;t they vote for</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.289">it yes they did but they&amp;#39;re complaining</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="4.53">about it that it&amp;#39;s too expensive for the</text>
  <text start="496.729" dur="4.591">staffers and it&amp;#39;s five thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="3.36">for each individual and if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.32" dur="4.29">pick up his insurance they won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="5.399">any and they&amp;#39;ll have to pay in taxes and</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="4.11">if I have a family I have to pay 11,000</text>
  <text start="508.159" dur="3.091">and if I don&amp;#39;t pay it i have to pay a</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="4.559">tax is what are we going to do well</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="4.919">guess what they got bailed out now what</text>
  <text start="514.279" dur="3.661">about the rest of America what about all</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="3.721">the people who are just barely getting</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="4.92">by with their salaries making the money</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="6">and they&amp;#39;re just struggling to get</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="6.06">through it they are being forced to take</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="4.83">medical insurance and if you don&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="4.71">it it doesn&amp;#39;t matter you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="5.6">paying in another way when something is</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="2.69">for the people</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="6.42">you do not penalize them you do not have</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="7.71">to sell it like a used car salesman like</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="8.69">Obama is doing it and there was a story</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="7.05">about a family company small companies</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="5.59">and the insurance companies have already</text>
  <text start="554.82" dur="4.98">warned small businesses and customers</text>
  <text start="557.52" dur="5.58">that premiums could rise around twenty</text>
  <text start="559.8" dur="6.51">percent or so in 2014 under this new</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="4.56">plan and you know President Obama is</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="3">also out there saying that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.71">shut down the government if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="6.24">fully fund his his plan now that is</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.85">ridiculous first of all making threats</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="5.16">if you don&amp;#39;t fully fund something and</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="4.59">they would never ever shut down the</text>
  <text start="580.71" dur="4.74">government because really think about it</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="4.92">what would that happen I mean if they</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="6.42">shut down the government Medicare</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="6.06">Medicaid every single program everything</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="3.36">that they have all their salaries and</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="4.64">everything would come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="8.31">halt and guess what they&amp;#39;re never ever</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="7.99">going to let that happen okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="603.54" dur="5.4">on here now us-egypt the Lions on a</text>

  <text start="611.19" dur="6.33">and there is a type of coup but you know</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="3.24">the US government does want to call it a</text>
  <text start="617.52" dur="7.11">coup because then they would have to</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="7.71">stop aid and funding Egypt the US wants</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="5.13">their puppet government in there this</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="3.93">way they can protect the US dollar as a</text>
