  <text start="68.78" dur="5.16">collapse news now what&amp;#39;s very strange is</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="4.95">that after the elections of Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="73.94" dur="5.55">leading into January of his inauguration</text>
  <text start="76.55" dur="7.23">up to this point we saw this bounce of</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="6.21">hope consumer sentiment rising the stock</text>
  <text start="83.78" dur="4.41">market of course moving up and up and up</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="6">and up and we saw a lot of things bounce</text>
  <text start="88.19" dur="5.49">and now things have bounced up and are</text>
  <text start="91.7" dur="4.23">headed back down it looked like the</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="5.82">whole thing was a dead cat bounce and</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="7.2">now things are deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="5.97">quickly now during the inauguration back</text>
  <text start="103.13" dur="5.61">in January the restaurant sales and</text>
  <text start="105.47" dur="5.67">traffic they moved up just a little bit</text>
  <text start="108.74" dur="4.47">well it looks like since that period of</text>
  <text start="111.14" dur="4.319">time coming from the most recent</text>
  <text start="113.21" dur="5.1">restaurant Performance Index report by</text>
  <text start="115.459" dur="5.25">the National Restaurant Association well</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="5.22">it looks like same store sales and</text>
  <text start="120.709" dur="7.041">customer traffic while they remain soft</text>
  <text start="123.53" dur="7.92">in January and they started to really</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="5.95">deteriorate in February and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="5.94">seeing is that the disclosure by</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="6.48">restaurant operators 50% of whom said</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="5.37">same store sales declined year-over-year</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="6">this is the second highest reading in</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="5.85">recent history and second only to the 53</text>
  <text start="146.18" dur="4.83">percent reported last August and what</text>
  <text start="148.61" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that same</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="4.29">store of sales fell by negative three</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="5.519">point seven percent in February with</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="6.75">traffic declining negative five percent</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="7.381">and we can see at this point when we</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="7.65">look back to last year well Restaurant</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="6.45">traffic and sales are way down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="4.259">not just seeing this in the food</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="4.41">industry we&amp;#39;re seeing this throughout</text>
  <text start="173.959" dur="6.901">retail and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="4.899">the retail apocalypse is upon us right</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="3.879">now</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="6.03">and when we look at retail everything is</text>
  <text start="184.739" dur="5.491">not awesome in fact it&amp;#39;s kind of awful</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="6.75">this is coming from Target CEO Brian</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="7.47">Cornell our industry is in the midst of</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="4.92">a seismic shift and of course you read</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.259">the headlines in fact many of you write</text>
  <text start="199.409" dur="4.44">the reports were operating an incredibly</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="4.291">challenging environment all across the</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="3.87">retail industry many of our competitors</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="4.26">are aggressively rationalizing their</text>
  <text start="207.719" dur="4.74">assets they are closing stores exiting</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="4.319">markets they&amp;#39;re cutting cost just to</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="4.56">keep their heads above water we&amp;#39;ve not</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="7.351">seen this number of distressed retailers</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="9.03">since 2009 in the Great Recession cheap</text>
  <text start="222.18" dur="6.72">debt created a massive retail estate</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="5.731">bubble that is now bursting right before</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="5.88">our eyes and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.829">before where retail square feet per</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="5.599">capita in the United States is more than</text>
  <text start="236.609" dur="6.421">six times that of Europe or Japan</text>
  <text start="240.379" dur="7.301">thousands of new doors open and rents</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="7.319">soared this created this gigantic bubble</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="6.139">and like housing the bubble is now</text>
  <text start="250.349" dur="8.161">bursting and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="7.51">in North America we have too many</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="4.589">shopping malls this was during the boom</text>
  <text start="261.329" dur="3.9">right before the Great Recession and</text>
  <text start="263.099" dur="5.671">things started to deteriorate quite</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="6.03">quickly throughout this fake recovery</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="3.95">and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="271.259" dur="4.171">monitoring this and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="5.439">retail continually declining declining</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="5.31">decline with mass store closures mass</text>
  <text start="278.159" dur="3.841">store layoffs but of course the</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="3.03">corporate media kept on blaming on the</text>
  <text start="282" dur="4.08">whether it was the way the Sun was</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="3.57">coming up it was a moon was shining too</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="3.66">bright they had so many different</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="4.62">excuses it was unbelievable but what</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that as people</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="6.199">lost their jobs as the demand for all</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="7.14">these products kind of disappeared</text>
  <text start="298.159" dur="5.94">because people don&amp;#39;t have the extra</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="4.799">money to go out and purchase these goods</text>
  <text start="304.099" dur="5.56">retail took a hit it wasn&amp;#39;t because of</text>
  <text start="306.659" dur="6.031">online that was a cover story that was</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="3.621">an excuse online sales make one tenth of</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="4.82">the</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="5.82">tail market so that&amp;#39;s impossible so what</text>
  <text start="317.51" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="2.67">contraction and people are all</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="2.28">scratching their heads how did this</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="3.27">happen all of a sudden out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="3.39">well we know how it happened</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="5.79">following it we understand that this</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="6.27">economy has been contracting since 2008</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="6.6">nothing improved the whole thing is one</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="5.73">gigantic illusion to keep us all in the</text>
  <text start="338.69" dur="3.81">dark like everything is fine that they</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="3.45">came up with the answer and they figured</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="5.669">out how to make the economy all better</text>
  <text start="344.33" dur="5.58">it was never made all better and this is</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="2.431">what people are going to understand very</text>
  <text start="349.91" dur="3.48">very shortly</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="5.04">things are gonna rapidly deteriorate</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="5.46">people aren&amp;#39;t gonna understand why is</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="4.35">this all of a sudden happening and we</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="2.49">can see right now when we look at</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.05">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="361.34" dur="4.889">for a very long time it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="4.74">right now and things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.351">and the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="3.05">to keep up with these stories like how</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="4.53">do we explain this away</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="5.5">people aren&amp;#39;t believing anymore and this</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="4.8">is when the illusion and reality start</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.11">to separate this is when people scratch</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="4.44">their heads and say something&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="4.68">here we had it in 2008 where we went</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="3.3">whoa what&amp;#39;s going on here something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="2.97">wrong why do we need all these bailouts</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="3.45">I thought the economy was fine I thought</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="3.81">everything was contained I thought</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="4.05">everything was rated triple-a housing</text>
  <text start="392.9" dur="3.48">could never go down well we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="3.87">the same thing happen right now</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="5.34">and this is why you need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="5.459">and ready for what is coming we see that</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="6.93">Jeff Sessions was out there he has about</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="6">46 remaining individuals that need to</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="5.34">resign and we can see there was a</text>
  <text start="410.479" dur="5.31">problem with one individual who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="5.489">want to resign he wanted to be fired and</text>
  <text start="415.789" dur="5.791">that was Preet Bharara and he refused to</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="3.571">quit so he was fired</text>
  <text start="421.58" dur="3.12">now everyone&amp;#39;s making a really big deal</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="5.22">about this oh my god he was fired from</text>
  <text start="424.7" dur="5.46">this but if you look back in 1993 Jeff</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="4.41">Sessions was fired by Bill Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="6.41">attorney General Janet Reno in the exact</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="9.14">same way we actually have the letter</text>
  <text start="436.57" dur="8.23">showing how he was let go he was fired</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="5.26">this is done all the time when a new</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="4.41">administration comes into power</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="5.73">and what this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing once</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="7.889">again now we understand that Trump put</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="7.05">forth his new refugee temporary ban and</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="4.171">we can see already that the corporate</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="3.75">media they&amp;#39;re making another big deal</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="4.619">about it and we can see that there is a</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="7.459">judge out there judge Connelly who</text>
  <text start="465.889" dur="8.671">decided to uphold this ban for Trump and</text>
  <text start="471.069" dur="5.951">he went ahead and he blocked Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="4.139">revised travel ban on Friday barring</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="4.35">enforcement of the policy to deny us</text>
  <text start="478.699" dur="4.47">entry to the wife and child of a Syrian</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="3.87">refugee who was already granted asylum</text>
  <text start="483.169" dur="4.321">in the United States now Conley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="5.22">temporary restraining order applies only</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="5.669">to the family of the Syrian refugee who</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="4.139">brought the case anonymously to protect</text>
  <text start="493.159" dur="4.44">the identities of his wife and daughter</text>
  <text start="494.599" dur="4.081">who still live in Aleppo so we can see</text>
  <text start="497.599" dur="3.12">right now the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="4.32">not gonna let up on this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.719" dur="4.29">gonna be pushing their agenda how far</text>
  <text start="503" dur="4.139">they gonna be able to take it well it</text>
  <text start="505.009" dur="5.46">looks like maybe not that far now we</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="5.82">understand that Obama he really thought</text>
  <text start="510.469" dur="4.11">and so did the establishment the deep</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="2.851">State the central bankers they thought</text>
  <text start="514.579" dur="2.731">that Hillary was going to be President</text>
  <text start="515.81" dur="3.839">because we understand that Obama bought</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="5.789">a home in Hawaii he was gonna move out</text>
  <text start="519.649" dur="4.56">of Washington go back to Hawaii and do</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="2.641">whatever he was going to do there</text>
  <text start="524.209" dur="3.841">probably write a book like we just saw</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="4.98">him get paid for about sixty million</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="5.76">dollars or so but he was going to leave</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="4.8">Washington but since Hillary did not get</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="3.48">into the White House he decided you know</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="3.78">something I&amp;#39;m not going to leave</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="6.15">Washington I&amp;#39;m going to purchase a house</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="5.789">there Eric Holder Valerie Jarrett we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="4.83">all gonna sit there in our little war</text>
  <text start="545.089" dur="6.111">room inside of Washington and make plans</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="4.62">for something else and we see that</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="3.52">representative Mike Kelly of</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="4.77">Pennsylvania well he was caught on film</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="6.72">saying that Obama extended his stay in</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="5.34">Washington DC for only one reason and</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="4.08">had nothing to do with his daughters</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.47">attending school and wanted to wait for</text>
  <text start="565.52" dur="5.49">them to graduate because he already had</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="7.17">plans to go to Hawaii he&amp;#39;s there to run</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="6.12">a shadow government to disrupt the Trump</text>
  <text start="574.64" dur="4.23">administration and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="3.6">point there are a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="4.17">there talking about this</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="4.08">and we can see that Eric Holder was</text>
  <text start="583.04" dur="4.47">saying that okay Trump is ready to go</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="5.01">and we know that Valerie Jarrett works</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="4.86">very closely with him plans everything</text>
  <text start="589.82" dur="5.4">she whispers into his ear and we</text>
  <text start="592.37" dur="5.7">understand from ex-cia Robert Steele</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="5.67">that something is planned for May first</text>
  <text start="598.07" dur="5.19">and we understand that Obama has been</text>
  <text start="600.89" dur="5.55">putting together a lot of individuals we</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="5.7">understand that they want riots and</text>
  <text start="606.44" dur="3.84">protests across the country we already</text>
  <text start="608.96" dur="2.97">see these individuals saying that</text>
  <text start="610.28" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re not going to be paying taxes I</text>
  <text start="611.93" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t think anyone should be paying</text>
  <text start="612.86" dur="4.47">taxes but we can see this whole point is</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="3.51">not because of the central bank let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="617.33" dur="4.2">up against the central bank it&amp;#39;s to go</text>
  <text start="619.01" dur="4.47">up against the Trump administration so</text>
  <text start="621.53" dur="4.74">we can see that we&amp;#39;re coming into very</text>
  <text start="623.48" dur="5.73">chaotic times not just here in the</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="6.75">United States but we&amp;#39;re seeing chaos all</text>

  <text start="642.68" dur="3.48">could just see this is happening in many</text>
  <text start="644.42" dur="2.88">different areas and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="4.74">continue because you have to remember</text>

  <text start="981.22" dur="2.76">we are seeing that they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="982.33" dur="3.69">following their goals they&amp;#39;re still</text>

  <text start="986.02" dur="4.89">trying to get Assad or split Syria up</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="4.29">and we can see chaos</text>
  <text start="990.91" dur="4.59">really starting to ramp up around the</text>
  <text start="993.22" dur="4.95">country right now which is going to lead</text>
  <text start="995.5" dur="4.5">into the economic crisis heading towards</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="4.44">us this summer we see there was an</text>
  <text start="1000" dur="4.38">intruder arrested after entering the</text>
  <text start="1002.61" dur="2.94">White House grounds now he was wearing a</text>
  <text start="1004.38" dur="6.33">backpack there was nothing in the</text>
  <text start="1005.55" dur="9.12">backpack but um curious was this pushed</text>
  <text start="1010.71" dur="6.33">to scare Trump remember going back a</text>
  <text start="1014.67" dur="5.19">couple of reports I said if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1017.04" dur="5.91">not control him they&amp;#39;re going to scare</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="7.979">him by having someone jump over the</text>
  <text start="1022.95" dur="6.27">fence while Trump was there might make</text>
  <text start="1027.839" dur="3.571">him a little nervous it might be a</text>
  <text start="1029.22" dur="4.469">little message that was sent the next</text>
  <text start="1031.41" dur="4.44">one might be some time someone taking a</text>
  <text start="1033.689" dur="5.431">shot at him trying to get him in line</text>
  <text start="1035.85" dur="5.04">with their agenda and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="1039.12" dur="3.99">point that things are starting to really</text>
  <text start="1040.89" dur="4.949">heat up here now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1043.11" dur="4.38">we know that Vitaly Churkin he died of a</text>
  <text start="1045.839" dur="4.261">heart attack at least that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="1047.49" dur="4.53">think happened but the State Department</text>
  <text start="1050.1" dur="5">asked the New York Medical Examiner not</text>
  <text start="1052.02" dur="7.02">to publicly release information about</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="5.32">Jerkins cause of death now the statement</text>
  <text start="1059.04" dur="4.05">was in order to comply with</text>
  <text start="1060.42" dur="4.5">international law and protocol the New</text>
  <text start="1063.09" dur="4.17">York City Law Department has instructed</text>
  <text start="1064.92" dur="4.38">the office of chief medical examiner to</text>
  <text start="1067.26" dur="4.08">not publicly disclose the cause and</text>
  <text start="1069.3" dur="4.95">manner of death of ambassador Vitaly</text>
  <text start="1071.34" dur="4.53">Churkin now we see at this point the</text>
  <text start="1074.25" dur="3.72">initial report is saying there were no</text>
  <text start="1075.87" dur="3.54">foul there was no foul play that it</text>
  <text start="1077.97" dur="5.37">looks like it was some type of cardiac</text>
  <text start="1079.41" dur="7.05">arrest but we understand the CIA has</text>
  <text start="1083.34" dur="5.88">ways of creating heart attacks I mean we</text>
  <text start="1086.46" dur="6.06">need to go back to 1975 here during the</text>
  <text start="1089.22" dur="6.39">church committee hearings the existence</text>
  <text start="1092.52" dur="5.7">of a secret assassination weapon came to</text>
  <text start="1095.61" dur="5.52">light the CIA had developed a poison</text>
  <text start="1098.22" dur="4.92">that could that could cause a victim to</text>
  <text start="1101.13" dur="4.08">have an immediate heart attack this</text>
  <text start="1103.14" dur="4.95">poison could be frozen into the shape of</text>
  <text start="1105.21" dur="5.19">a dart and then fired at high speed from</text>
  <text start="1108.09" dur="4.62">a pistol the gun was capable of shooting</text>
  <text start="1110.4" dur="4.31">the icy projectile with enough speed</text>
  <text start="1112.71" dur="4.849">that the dart would go through the</text>
  <text start="1114.71" dur="5.37">of the target and leave just a tiny red</text>
  <text start="1117.559" dur="4.051">mark once in the body the poison would</text>
  <text start="1120.08" dur="3.51">melt and be absorbed into the</text>
  <text start="1121.61" dur="5.49">bloodstream causing a heart attack now</text>
  <text start="1123.59" dur="7.44">that was back in 1975 today technology</text>
  <text start="1127.1" dur="5.73">has advanced and I&amp;#39;m wondering if the</text>
  <text start="1131.03" dur="6.54">State Department is looking at this and</text>
  <text start="1132.83" dur="8.18">they found evidence of foul play and the</text>
  <text start="1137.57" dur="5.07">CIA at the time might have murdered</text>
  <text start="1141.01" dur="4.66">Vitaly Churkin</text>
  <text start="1142.64" dur="5.31">and once Russia hears about this well</text>
  <text start="1145.67" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;d be problems there could be war</text>
  <text start="1147.95" dur="3.9">there could be something happening and</text>
  <text start="1149.809" dur="4.681">it looks like maybe at this point</text>
  <text start="1151.85" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re holding this back to say okay</text>
  <text start="1154.49" dur="4.11">wait a minute we need to work this out</text>
  <text start="1156.05" dur="5.03">before anything else goes any further</text>
  <text start="1158.6" dur="6.09">and we can see there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="1161.08" dur="7.45">individuals from Russia that died of</text>
  <text start="1164.69" dur="5.19">heart attack or unknown reasons and it</text>
  <text start="1168.53" dur="3.57">wasn&amp;#39;t just like one or two three people</text>
  <text start="1169.88" dur="4.35">one or two or three people it was many</text>
  <text start="1172.1" dur="3.99">different people that this happened to</text>
  <text start="1174.23" dur="4.17">and it looks like the deep State the</text>
  <text start="1176.09" dur="5.16">central bankers they are trying to push</text>
  <text start="1178.4" dur="6.029">their agenda to create some type of an</text>

  <text start="1185.96" dur="4.53">going into April going into May with the</text>
  <text start="1188.36" dur="4.53">debt ceiling this whole thing is going</text>
