  <text start="96.18" dur="5.85">Jinping of China working out trade deals</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="3.33">because what has happened in the past</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="3.75">with the deep state in the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.829">system they made it very lopsided</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="4.589">because the central bank system was</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="3.531">supposed to move to China they were</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="3.991">going to be the manufacturing powerhouse</text>
  <text start="112.04" dur="4.48">the United States eventually was going</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="5.31">to lose the war and everything was going</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="7.76">to be based in this area and everything</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="8.87">was lopsided to make China more powerful</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="7.299">make China the leading manufacturer</text>
  <text start="128.54" dur="4.12">meanwhile everything was being stripped</text>
  <text start="131.579" dur="4.861">away from the United States</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="6.18">manufacturing corporations our identity</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="5.16">and our military secrets everything you</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="4.02">name it it was stripped away Trump what</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s been doing is he&amp;#39;d been bringing</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="4.98">everything back evening out the playing</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="5.07">field and remember the deep state they</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="5.399">are with in Russia they&amp;#39;re in China</text>
  <text start="150.63" dur="5.49">throughout the record throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="5.491">they&amp;#39;re in South America the deep state</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.11">is deep and wide they have operatives</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3.6">everywhere they&amp;#39;ve been working on this</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="3.66">for a very long time this is not some</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="3.27">they just came up with it one day and</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="3">said hey you know something let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="3.32">everything out of the United States and</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="4.26">let&amp;#39;s move it to someplace else and</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="5.68">there is many different factions within</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="6.27">the United States and they all did have</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="6.3">different agendas but one main agenda as</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="7.38">we can see is the central bank system</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="6.96">they have one agenda and one agenda only</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="4.74">control doesn&amp;#39;t matter where they are</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="3.36">based out of actually they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="3.59">where they&amp;#39;re based out of they have no</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.22">allegiance to a people or a group and</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="6.4">you can see by what has been happening</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="5.58">is that they were planning to shift</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="5.28">everything well Trump is shifting</text>
  <text start="202.02" dur="5.4">everything back taking the power away</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="5.49">from them he&amp;#39;s working with the Asian</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="5.31">ping to do this and this is why you see</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="4.86">the tariffs this is why you see the</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="4.56">trade negotiations and actually Xi</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="4.23">Jinping and Trump they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="4.29">together to keep the economic system the</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="4.17">central bank economic system moving</text>
  <text start="221.58" dur="4.95">along a little bit longer because they</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="5.22">both know that they need to put</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.76">everything in place and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="5.25">about the belton road I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="4.57">trade that is equalized between the two</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="4.53">nations trade that it&amp;#39;s equalized</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="6.03">between many nations they need to do</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="5.429">this way before the entire system is</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="4.65">transition you cannot transition the</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="6.421">system while it is lopsided it will not</text>
  <text start="246.54" dur="6.36">work and if the United States is not</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="6">receiving the benefit from this trade</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="6.51">system then when this whole system comes</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="5.4">down the transition would not work out</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="4.11">very well this is why Trump has been</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="5.16">pushing very very hard to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="5.64">the globalist plans and to create these</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="4.02">trade deals that puts the United States</text>
  <text start="269.16" dur="5.85">back on an even playing field remember</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="8.34">the petro dollar system was a completely</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="7.32">different design it wasn&amp;#39;t about trade</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="4.89">it wasn&amp;#39;t about having everything equal</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.26">it wasn&amp;#39;t about having the United States</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="5.43">as a manufacturing powerhouse it was</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="5.37">designed completely different than what</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="4.59">Trump is trying to do here and he needs</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="4.05">everything in place before we make this</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="3.54">transition because without it</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="3.72">it would be very very difficult for many</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="4.35">people in the United States would not be</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="4.92">able to make it but what we do see</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="5.4">happening right now because of all this</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="5.49">we see the central bank system well</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="4.95">starting to see the ramifications of</text>
  <text start="311.79" dur="5.61">their system falling apart if you look</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="5.04">out in Europe you can see that European</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="4.76">car sales they are continually declining</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="5.58">they are not doing well whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="322.16" dur="5.8">if you look at the passenger car</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.34">registrations in Europe they&amp;#39;ve dropped</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="6.69">by four point six percent year over year</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="5.91">and sales declined in all the largest</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.95">markets in Germany France the UK Italy</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="4.32">in Spain so this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="2.55">the brexit has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="5.76">anything else</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="8.19">you can see the entire system imploding</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="5.34">on itself now if you take the breakdown</text>
  <text start="350.34" dur="3.35">here of the manufacturers you can see</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.56">how bad it is</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="6.82">VW their group sales have dropped by six</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="5.55">point four percent we see were null they</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="4.08">drop by point nine percent here on your</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.19">Ford sales drop by six point six percent</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="6.06">year-on-year BMW three point one percent</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="5.64">year-on-year Daimler sales dropped by</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="5.76">one point five percent Toyota six</text>
  <text start="373.32" dur="7.89">percent Nissan twenty four point seven</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="7.35">percent year-on-year and you can see</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="7.59">that it is hitting very very hard now</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="7.89">China has also seen a decline in vehicle</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="6.47">sales now it&amp;#39;s very interesting I am</text>
  <text start="391.65" dur="7.92">wondering if all of a sudden we see this</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="6.46">number flip where we don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.59">declining any more and we start to see</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="6.06">it increasing because China has</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="7.71">unleashed this gargantuan money printing</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="7.04">agenda to re-inflate their economy so if</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re doing that you might see</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="8.14">passenger vehicles in China increase</text>
  <text start="417.63" dur="7.17">which will then in turn help Europe why</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="5.82">is this happening I do believe that</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.86">Trump and G they coordinated together to</text>
  <text start="428.79" dur="4.56">keep vehicle</text>
  <text start="429.66" dur="7.23">me going through the 2020 election then</text>
  <text start="433.35" dur="5.85">after that they can have the transition</text>
  <text start="436.89" dur="5.16">and you can see that there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="5.12">countries out there they are preparing</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="5.61">and getting ready for this transition</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="6.37">remember from this point moving</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="7.14">backwards everything was being prepared</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="6.42">for the transition into a new central</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="4.59">bank system into a global system into a</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="5">globalist trade system and everything</text>
  <text start="459.39" dur="8.13">that had to do with the globalist agenda</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="7.66">now everything is being reversed so</text>
  <text start="467.52" dur="5.07">Trump tweeted out and he said listen the</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="3.99">trade deal with China it seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="3.72">going pretty darn well</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="4.08">he said trade negotiations have just</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="3.93">returned from China where the meetings</text>
  <text start="477.84" dur="4.86">on trade were very productive now at</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.44">meetings with me at Mara Largo giving</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="3.03">the details in the meantime billions of</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="3.42">dollars are being paid to the United</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="5.7">States by China in the form of trade</text>
  <text start="488.1" dur="6.66">tariffs bringing the money back into the</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="7.38">United States instead of borrowing from</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="6.24">the Fed he also said important meaning</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="4.5">and calls on China trade deal and more</text>
  <text start="501" dur="6.15">today with my staff big progress being</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="7.2">made on so many different fronts our our</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="5.73">country has such fantastic potential for</text>
  <text start="510.51" dur="6.27">future growth and greatness on an even</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="8.039">higher level and the word so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="7.139">about five O&amp;#39;s that follow the s saying</text>
  <text start="520.919" dur="6.211">that it&amp;#39;s not just about the trade deals</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="6.781">there&amp;#39;s so much more going on which he</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="6.36">cannot tell people about and during his</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="4.74">press conference with the national</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="4.14">emergency they were asking Trump about</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="4.05">the debt and what are we gonna do about</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="4.11">the debt now of course Trump can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="3.3">out and say hey listen this is how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="2.16">gonna take care of the debt we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="2.55">get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="543.9" dur="2.85">we&amp;#39;re gonna get rid of the IMF we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.34" dur="3.57">gonna get rid of the Ross trial banking</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="5.52">system altogether and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="6.03">reset everything and erase this debt he</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="6.6">can&amp;#39;t say that right out he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="554.94" dur="7.41">release those plans so his message was</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="4.6">that we&amp;#39;re going to use growth to get</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="2.86">rid of the</text>
  <text start="563.47" dur="3.09">and of course the reporter said well</text>
  <text start="565.21" dur="3.06">what do you mean by growth how is that</text>
  <text start="566.56" dur="6.24">going to reduce the debt and of course</text>
  <text start="568.27" dur="7.56">Trump can&amp;#39;t let on to the entire plan</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="6.03">and you can see there&amp;#39;s a lot more going</text>
  <text start="575.83" dur="5.46">on than what he is saying and I believe</text>
  <text start="578.83" dur="4.98">this is why he said so many different</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="6.96">fronts because it&amp;#39;s not just one front</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="7.41">this plan encompasses many fronts and we</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="4.62">do see a lot of countries they realize</text>
  <text start="591.22" dur="3.51">and they understand what is going on</text>
  <text start="592.87" dur="4.02">they know that there&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="4.05">type of transition they&amp;#39;ve known it for</text>
  <text start="596.89" dur="4.53">quite a while and you can see a lot of</text>
  <text start="598.78" dur="5.19">the foreign nations well they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="7.32">to be holding on to all this debt so</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="7.95">they&amp;#39;ve been selling US Treasuries so</text>
  <text start="608.74" dur="4.74">foreign holdings of US Treasuries have</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="4.65">been declining in recent years and</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="6.18">dropped to just over 36% as a percentage</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.92">of total holding the lowest in over a</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="5.19">decade as domestic holdings of US paper</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="6.78">have risen to just shy of 50 percent and</text>
  <text start="624.85" dur="5.91">near all-time highs so we see foreigners</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="3.54">in different countries they&amp;#39;re dumping</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="3.06">the Treasuries but here in the United</text>
  <text start="631.81" dur="3.72">States we see they&amp;#39;re going into pension</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="4.59">funds they&amp;#39;re going into other</text>
  <text start="635.53" dur="6.27">investments actually we see the Fed is</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="5.49">also dumping the Treasuries now is this</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="5.16">a good scenario I don&amp;#39;t believe so</text>
  <text start="643.9" dur="4.95">so foreigners they dumped around 77</text>
  <text start="646.96" dur="3.93">billion in US Treasuries in December</text>
  <text start="648.85" dur="4.59">this is the most on record and the</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="5.52">biggest sellers were France Brazil and</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="6.39">Germany and it looks like and this has</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="6.96">been planned out going way back during</text>
  <text start="659.83" dur="6.24">the Obama administration where pension</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="4.5">funds I arrays and other things we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.07" dur="4.56">going to purchase the Treasuries because</text>
  <text start="667.87" dur="4.5">foreign nations they didn&amp;#39;t want to hold</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="3.84">up they still don&amp;#39;t want to hold on to</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="6.87">these Treasuries because the yield on</text>
  <text start="674.47" dur="10.07">them is very very low and what happens</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="8.73">when America hold on to its own debt and</text>
  <text start="684.54" dur="6.1">everything falls apart it&amp;#39;s not really a</text>
  <text start="687.97" dur="5.79">great scenario actually China right now</text>
  <text start="690.64" dur="6.009">actually increased its holdings of</text>
  <text start="693.76" dur="5.65">Treasuries so I do believe</text>
  <text start="696.649" dur="5.67">that Trump and G they&amp;#39;re trying to work</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="4.44">it out in a way where they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="702.319" dur="3.39">for this transition because remember</text>
  <text start="703.85" dur="4.83">there are still things that are</text>
  <text start="705.709" dur="5.011">happening that the deep state essential</text>
  <text start="708.68" dur="4.05">banks have put into place Trump right</text>
  <text start="710.72" dur="4.5">now has to reverse everything and I</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="4.859">believe at this time which using pain</text>
  <text start="715.22" dur="3.899">with the trade deals with boosting the</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="3.271">economy up for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="719.119" dur="3.931">kicking the can down the street you have</text>
  <text start="720.86" dur="4.409">to remember he&amp;#39;s using all the tools</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="4.56">that the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="725.269" dur="5.391">have used in the past he&amp;#39;s using it</text>
  <text start="727.61" dur="7.62">against them and he&amp;#39;s setting the stage</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="8.26">so he can properly transition this</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="5.579">economy into a brand new economy so what</text>
  <text start="738.92" dur="5.37">have they&amp;#39;ve done in the past well they</text>
  <text start="740.809" dur="6.27">printed a lot of currency China has</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="6.63">printed a lot of currency what did it do</text>
  <text start="747.079" dur="7.29">since 2008 it propped up the system if</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="5.699">China right now is creating a lot of</text>
  <text start="754.369" dur="5.16">currency what is it going to do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.619" dur="5.4">going through prop up the entire economy</text>
  <text start="759.529" dur="4.86">remember China is the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="762.019" dur="4.651">powerhouse if they boost their economy</text>
  <text start="764.389" dur="4.2">well it&amp;#39;s gonna flow out into Europe and</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="3.45">to the United States and everything is</text>
  <text start="768.589" dur="3.24">going to look a lot better the emerging</text>
  <text start="770.12" dur="4.23">markets actually will look a lot better</text>
  <text start="771.829" dur="5.341">and I believe this is the plane and this</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="7.649">will hold until the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="777.17" dur="7.94">because Trump the Q team they know there</text>
  <text start="781.999" dur="7.08">was a plan to bring the economy down and</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="6.039">Trump with his team they are countering</text>
  <text start="789.079" dur="5.55">this plan and they&amp;#39;re stating setting</text>
  <text start="791.149" dur="6.841">the stage to transition out of the</text>
  <text start="794.629" dur="6.091">central bank system once we pass the</text>
  <text start="797.99" dur="4.889">2020 election and I believe this is what</text>
  <text start="800.72" dur="4.95">they are working on and this is why</text>
  <text start="802.879" dur="5.101">Trump has tweeted out that there there</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="6.349">are so many different things going on</text>
  <text start="807.98" dur="7.589">right now so the stage has been set</text>
  <text start="812.019" dur="7.36">precautions have been taken and G and</text>
  <text start="815.569" dur="7.23">Trump they are working together to rout</text>
  <text start="819.379" dur="6.721">out the central bank system and to</text>
  <text start="822.799" dur="6.181">eventually take over the central bank</text>
  <text start="826.1" dur="6.21">system and take it out of the hands</text>
  <text start="828.98" dur="5.25">of the Roth trials out of the deep state</text>
  <text start="832.31" dur="5.55">and all these different players and</text>
  <text start="834.23" dur="6.21">bring it back to the people the control</text>
  <text start="837.86" dur="4.979">of the people instead of having a</text>
  <text start="840.44" dur="5.579">private corporation and private</text>
  <text start="842.839" dur="6.36">individuals who weren&amp;#39;t elected having</text>

  <text start="868.25" dur="5.76">there are many many steps that have to</text>
  <text start="870.709" dur="6.331">be taken to safeguard the entire</text>
  <text start="874.01" dur="5.97">economic system just can&amp;#39;t pull the plug</text>
