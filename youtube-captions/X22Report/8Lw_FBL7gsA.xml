  <text start="96.81" dur="3.809">days where Greece is sitting there</text>
  <text start="98.459" dur="4.921">saying yes they can make this payment no</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="6.051">problem there scrounger around trying to</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="5.37">find the funds and there are certain</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="3.729">outlets out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="3.869">absolutely not Greece is completely</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="3.39">broke on one of them I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="3.991">completely broke they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="113.789" dur="4.651">funds last time they made the payment</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="3.959">they had to dip into the emergency SDR</text>
  <text start="118.44" dur="4.739">from the IMF just to make that payment</text>
  <text start="120.569" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the Greek</text>
  <text start="123.179" dur="4.321">officials are continually saying that</text>
  <text start="125.459" dur="5.22">yes they can make this payment but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="5.84">hearing from a serezha spokesman and</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="6.751">they&amp;#39;re saying listen if there&amp;#39;s no deal</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.71">inked within the next 48 hours greece</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="3.96">will definitely miss that friday payment</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="3.99">and we understand that at the IMF said</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="3.39">that yes they can miss that payment as</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="4.169">long as they make up all the payments by</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="5.94">the end of the month and we can see that</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="5.67">this is falling right into this the ECB</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="5.43">has increased the emergency liquidity</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="6.661">assistance ela provided to the greek</text>
  <text start="156.15" dur="7.14">banks by 500 million euros to 80 point</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="4.77">seven billion euros from 80.2 so this is</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="3.21">very interesting</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s going on here and then we have</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="5.25">the French president president Hollande</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="6.57">he&amp;#39;s out there saying it is a matter of</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="7.489">a few days we are a few hours away from</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="7.259">a possible settlement he also added that</text>
  <text start="179.239" dur="7.36">when they decide to settle all this and</text>
  <text start="182.489" dur="6.03">we they come to an agreement Greece will</text>
  <text start="186.599" dur="5.491">return to growth you mean just like</text>
  <text start="188.519" dur="6.511">France France is not growing France is</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.04">collapsing unemployment is going up so</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.289">can we really believe the French</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="5.91">president at this time I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="4.801">think so could there be a deal maybe so</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.88">but we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see what this</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="6.51">deal is because if it includes austerity</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="4.929">dipping into the pensions reforming them</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="6.359">or anything like that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="212.849" dur="6.601">be a huge huge problem especially with</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="5.58">the people because they elected this</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="5.94">government because they didn&amp;#39;t want more</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="5.311">estar austerity they wanted economic</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="4.379">growth they wanted jobs they wanted a</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="4.22">house they want to be able to pay for</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="5.611">their bills they just wanted to live</text>
  <text start="232.1" dur="5.41">without any of these problems and this</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="4.859">is all they wanted this is what any of</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="6.09">us want we just want to be left alone we</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="6.72">want to live our lives we want to work</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="6.54">we want to make a good income we want to</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="8.21">support our families that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.14" dur="10.02">all we&amp;#39;re looking for and to be at peace</text>
  <text start="255.169" dur="7.151">we see the president of the confederal</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="6.42">group of the European United left is</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="8.909">saying that austerity increases debt it</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="6.78">does not lead to economic growth and I</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="4.951">completely agree this is coming from</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="5.82">Gabrielle&amp;#39;s Zimmer saying the debt</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="5.64">problem can be resolved first and</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="4.83">foremost by ending the austerity policy</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="6.63">and this is the one of the reasons that</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="7.44">is augmenting because when you have this</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="5.7">austerity people are not working the</text>
  <text start="291.45" dur="5.52">government is taking on more debt and as</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="3.69">they take on more debt they ruin their</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="6.27">revenues</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="7.26">and this has been proven now when we</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="3.36">look at France when we look at Greece</text>
  <text start="305.1" dur="7.28">when we look at Cyprus when we look at</text>
  <text start="306.6" dur="11.52">Italy it is a fact getting more debt and</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="9.009">getting rid of jobs does not work we see</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="7.38">the eurozone it looks like they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="6.601">the same calculations as the BLS here in</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.76">the United States unemployment in the</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="5.45">eurozone fell to 11.1 percent in April</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="5.52">this is the lowest rate in three years</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="6.13">the jobless rate in April was down from</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="4.83">11.2 percent in March but you have to</text>
  <text start="339.57" dur="5.58">remember the March figure was revised</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="6.029">downward from 11.3 so it looks like</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re starting to use the manipulated</text>
  <text start="347.639" dur="3.241">calculations actually they probably most</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="4.14">likely been using manipulated</text>
  <text start="350.88" dur="4.23">calculations all this time and now</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re just manipulating them some more</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="3.809">because the numbers aren&amp;#39;t making sense</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="4.621">so they have to show that unemployment</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="4.201">is decreasing especially when we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="5.129">showing unemployment especially in</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="6.21">France has increased so we can see at</text>
  <text start="366.479" dur="5.431">this point in time the eurozone is in</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="6.57">big trouble at this time we understand</text>
  <text start="371.91" dur="6.27">the ECB is out there creating money out</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="4.079">of thin air just like the Fed did and</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="3.33">this does not spur economic growth</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="5.071">whatsoever here in the United States</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="6.75">what are we seeing well adb came out</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="5.75">with their employment numbers and having</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="6.42">fallen for five straight months and</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="8.049">missed expectations for the last four we</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="7.38">see mais 201,000 print was a little bit</text>
  <text start="398.849" dur="7.141">above the 200,000 that was expected this</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="5.19">was a modest bounce and of course the</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="3.12">corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="407.25" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re in a full-time recovery everything</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="6.239">is fine but you have to remember how</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="3.72">many more layoffs are coming down the</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="4.141">line just because a company announced a</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="4.32">layoff today doesn&amp;#39;t mean they laid off</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="4.98">all the people today it&amp;#39;s going to go on</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="6.449">throughout this year and we&amp;#39;ve had huge</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="5.43">layoffs coming and we could see when we</text>
  <text start="428.039" dur="3.751">look at these numbers that the large</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="7.02">firms employ for</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="10.92">that have 500 or more actually sword</text>
  <text start="436.92" dur="10.65">jobs shed we see manufacturing jobs have</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="9">declined for the third month in a row so</text>
  <text start="447.57" dur="7.16">we were in a downward trend of jobs if</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="8.3">we go back to November of 2014 we saw a</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="9.37">284,000 January of 2015 220,000 March</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="6.52">176,000 April 165,000 and then all of a</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="5.81">sudden everyone decided we need to get a</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="7.86">job and we bounced up to 200 and 1,000</text>
  <text start="469.91" dur="8.29">how is this possible all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="474.39" dur="5.91">people are getting jobs now you have to</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="4.8">remember how they count this they still</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="4.44">do and they are always going to count it</text>
  <text start="483" dur="3.75">this way until they manipulated some</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="6.42">more and they change it but they are</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="8.69">counting part-time jobs as full-time</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="6.72">jobs so as more and more people go out</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.27">into the workforce getting laid off from</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="4.16">their full-time work and they get these</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="7.35">part-time jobs they are counted as</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="7.51">having a full-time job we see here in</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="6.63">the United States auto sales have</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="6.51">reached 10 year highs how in the world</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="4.68">is this possible does this mean that</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re in this incredible recovery does</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="5.12">this mean that everything is fine no</text>
  <text start="521.22" dur="6.72">because when you look at the entire</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="8.38">situation in auto sales you see how they</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="6">did it and we see the experienced senior</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="5.88">director of automatic automotive finance</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="6.27">Melinda zabriskie said extending the</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="5.19">loan term is simply the most logical way</text>
  <text start="540.21" dur="6.9">for borrowers to buy cars they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="542.94" dur="6.84">really afford what most longer-term</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="4.35">loans help consumers keep monthly</text>
  <text start="549.78" dur="3.45">payments manageable while allowing them</text>
  <text start="551.46" dur="3.6">to purchase the vehicles they need</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="4.41">without having to break the bank in</text>
  <text start="555.06" dur="5.25">other words either car buyers are</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="5.07">overreaching as home buyers did back</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="5.15">before two thousand eight or the</text>
  <text start="562.71" dur="8.04">American consumer is completely</text>
  <text start="565.46" dur="7.03">tapped out in real bad shape and the</text>
  <text start="570.75" dur="6.03">only way they can get any of these cars</text>
  <text start="572.49" dur="7.32">is to extend the loan terms and either</text>
  <text start="576.78" dur="6.35">these situations is not there it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="579.81" dur="6.03">good it&amp;#39;s actually a terrible situation</text>
  <text start="583.13" dur="7.33">the average loan term right now for a</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="7.74">car is about 67 months loan terms with</text>
  <text start="590.46" dur="7.4">74 to 84 months made up around thirty</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="6.87">percent of all new vehicle financing and</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="4.78">when we look at this a fifth of all</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="4.92">loans and the collateral pool are made</text>
  <text start="602.64" dur="6.15">of made to borrowers with FICO scores</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="4.98">between 350 and 500 actually when we</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="6">look at this we see people have no</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="8.25">scores whatsoever that was about fifteen</text>
  <text start="614.79" dur="8.1">percent of the loans 351 to 500 made up</text>
  <text start="618.6" dur="7.56">about nineteen percent 501 to 550 made</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="6.92">up about twenty-nine percent and 550 to</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="6.93">600 was another twenty-six percent and</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="5.65">we can see that the rate of decline the</text>
  <text start="633.09" dur="5.52">rate of delinquencies is increase</text>
  <text start="635.46" dur="4.68">increasingly rising it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="3">and harder for these people to make the</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="3.18">payments and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.61" dur="4.08">continually extending the loans here</text>
  <text start="643.32" dur="4.77">because the payments are just too high</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="5.31">think about it you came from a full-time</text>
  <text start="648.09" dur="5.22">job you work on a part-time job you need</text>
  <text start="651" dur="6.3">an automobile that&amp;#39;s reliable to get to</text>
  <text start="653.31" dur="8.03">work how can you make the payments well</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="8.16">you extend the term and now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.34" dur="7.69">paying out over seven eight nine years</text>
  <text start="665.46" dur="7.67">pretty soon will be 12 years as things</text>
  <text start="669.03" dur="6.93">get worse and worse as time goes on but</text>
  <text start="673.13" dur="6.75">perhaps the best bubble indicator of all</text>
  <text start="675.96" dur="7.62">is the rise of the cash out auto loan</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="6.16">use your car as collateral or equity</text>
  <text start="683.58" dur="5.97">loan can help put your car to work for</text>
  <text start="686.04" dur="6.78">you the cash out loan is the new home</text>
  <text start="689.55" dur="7.14">equity loan welcome to the great</text>
  <text start="692.82" dur="5.64">American car bubble here this bubble is</text>
  <text start="696.69" dur="4.17">being inflated</text>
  <text start="698.46" dur="3.9">along with the student loan bubble the</text>
  <text start="700.86" dur="4.14">stock market bubble the derivative</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="6.09">bubble the housing bubble the bond</text>
  <text start="705" dur="6.27">bubble you name it each one of these we</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="5.58">are in a major major bubble this is a</text>
  <text start="711.27" dur="6.24">perfect storm of bubbles and they will</text>
  <text start="714.03" dur="7.64">pop we&amp;#39;re even seeing a tech sector</text>
  <text start="717.51" dur="7.35">bubble just like we saw back in 2001</text>
  <text start="721.67" dur="5.17">markets services PMI in May missed</text>
  <text start="724.86" dur="3.48">expectations and drop for the second</text>
  <text start="726.84" dur="4.68">month in a row to its lowest since</text>
  <text start="728.34" dur="5.79">January slowing service sector growth</text>
  <text start="731.52" dur="5.67">adds to signs that the US economy has</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="4.65">lost some momentum actually the economy</text>
  <text start="737.19" dur="4.74">that lose any momentum it never had</text>

  <text start="1223.4" dur="4.59">was forty-seven percent and they</text>
  <text start="1225.71" dur="3.57">replaced it with worthless bank stock</text>

  <text start="2624.8" dur="5.04">propaganda they&amp;#39;re ready to go in and we</text>
  <text start="2626.84" dur="5.1">know their mission is to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="2629.84" dur="4.56">and if the p5 plus one talks don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="2631.94" dur="5.97">they will then maneuver their way into</text>

  <text start="2637.91" dur="5.76">from an ex US Senate candidate mark dan</text>
  <text start="2641.3" dur="4.5">cough he says Israel is preparing to</text>
  <text start="2643.67" dur="4.29">carry out a false flag operation in the</text>
  <text start="2645.8" dur="4.89">United States which it will blame on</text>
  <text start="2647.96" dur="5.88">Iran to get the United States into war</text>
  <text start="2650.69" dur="5.55">with Iran he said I have maintained from</text>
  <text start="2653.84" dur="4.47">the beginning that Israel is planning</text>
  <text start="2656.24" dur="4.41">and will in some point attempt a false</text>
  <text start="2658.31" dur="4.29">flag incident probably within the</text>
  <text start="2660.65" dur="5.16">continental United States that will</text>
  <text start="2662.6" dur="7.89">facilitate is really intelligence and</text>
  <text start="2665.81" dur="8.12">falsely blame on a ram and we know that</text>
  <text start="2670.49" dur="7.44">Iran is going to receive the s-300 /</text>
  <text start="2673.93" dur="6">s400 air defense missile systems in 2016</text>

  <text start="2679.93" dur="4.78">that a false flag can occur because with</text>
  <text start="2683.42" dur="7.32">those missile systems it will make it</text>
  <text start="2684.71" dur="8.61">very difficult to wage an attack on Iran</text>
  <text start="2690.74" dur="5.43">and I would be surprised is there if</text>
  <text start="2693.32" dur="4.26">there was a false flag event and I think</text>
  <text start="2696.17" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re building up for many different</text>

  <text start="2708.05" dur="4.62">now the question is why would I ran all</text>
  <text start="2710.78" dur="4.35">of a sudden do this what would be their</text>

  <text start="2727.64" dur="4.89">say they plant a dirty bomb someplace</text>
  <text start="2730.7" dur="5.07">here in the United States and it is</text>
  <text start="2732.53" dur="7.89">blamed on Iran why would they want the</text>
