  <text start="127.88" dur="5.85">jae-in of South Korea have met prior to</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="6.089">the summit and we can see this whole</text>
  <text start="133.73" dur="6.09">strategy was to trap the deeps they trap</text>
  <text start="137.269" dur="5.22">the corporate media in their lies and</text>
  <text start="139.82" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re the ones who continually pushed</text>
  <text start="142.489" dur="4.921">the story that kim jong hoon wants to</text>
  <text start="145.1" dur="4.71">cancel the summit he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="4.32">forward with it and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="4.62">turns out to be fake phony and false as</text>
  <text start="151.73" dur="6.36">usual because remember the corporate</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="6.899">media they use propaganda they have the</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="5.399">ability to use propaganda they follow</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="4.861">whatever the intelligence agencies tell</text>
  <text start="163.489" dur="4.56">them to do especially clamper Brennan</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="3.329">the former intelligence agencies they</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="4.231">even have jobs with the corporate media</text>
  <text start="169.519" dur="6.211">right now and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="4.739">that the summit is back on and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="3.9">gonna be talking about denuclearization</text>
  <text start="177.019" dur="4.321">peace and I do believe the letter that</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="4.47">Trump put out there was not really</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="4.619">directed to Kim jong-un even though the</text>
  <text start="184.1" dur="2.52">corporate media put it out there he put</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="3.36">it out on</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="5.99">his Twitter feed I think those this was</text>
  <text start="189.319" dur="5.461">directed to the deep state and basically</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="4.06">focusing in saying listen we can do this</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="4.47">the easy way the hard way how do you</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="5.67">want to do this and I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="5.549">at any time was this going to be</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="4.11">canceled I think the peace talks already</text>
  <text start="204.799" dur="4.171">happened in the background this is for</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="4.319">the show this is for everyone else for</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="3.78">the corporate media for everyone to see</text>
  <text start="210.769" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s happening but if you noticed Kim</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="5.79">Jong moon followed through on everything</text>
  <text start="215.569" dur="6.42">that he was supposed to do releasing the</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="7.8">hostages destroying the nuclear sites</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="5.761">all prior to the summit so this is very</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="3.81">interesting but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.5">that the summit it looks like it is</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="4.08">happening and we&amp;#39;re on that path now the</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="4.92">deep State maybe it&amp;#39;ll try something we</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="4.979">don&amp;#39;t know but again it is on we see</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="4.62">right now that Russia they are making</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="4.321">economic deals with Turkey they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="3.39">making economic deals with Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="5.76">making economic deals now with Greece</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="6.54">and we see a lot of countries they sent</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="4.89">delegates to the st. Petersburg Economic</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="4.62">Forum there are about 15,000</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="5.58">participants from over a hundred</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="5.28">countries and we know that France was</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="4.14">there China was there Russia was there</text>
  <text start="261.62" dur="4.35">Greece was there Turkey was there many</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="3.84">many countries were there and we see</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="5.61">that Greece was there to seek Russian</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="5.31">cooperation on building ships and it</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="4.53">looks like they&amp;#39;re looking to make a</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="4.589">deal we see Russia and Turkey they have</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="3.39">reached a deal on the construction of</text>
  <text start="277.639" dur="3.331">the land-based part of the Turkish</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="3.96">stream branch that will bring Russian</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="5.879">gas to the Europe to the European</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="6.45">consumers and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="286.849" dur="6.63">European countries are moving closer and</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="7.56">closer to the Russian China economic</text>
  <text start="293.479" dur="8.071">system and moving away from the US based</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="7.77">dollar now this is planned this is being</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="7.32">pushed because the dollar is dying and</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="7.109">it is moving all of these countries away</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="6.26">from the dying dollar the central bank</text>
  <text start="312.349" dur="6.721">dying dollar which the deep state uses</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="5.17">we also see US warships they allegedly</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="2.67">entered the south</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="3.329">trying to see this is all coming from</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="4.079">anonymous sources coming from the</text>
  <text start="323.629" dur="5.311">corporate media and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="325.819" dur="6.63">saying that the US has the right to</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="5.969">freely sale in these areas near the</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="5.071">Paracel Islands in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="334.909" dur="4.891">and we heard all this before during the</text>
  <text start="337.52" dur="4.41">Obama reign where they continually</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.649">sailed these ships over there trying to</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="4.049">provoke China we also heard that Kim</text>
  <text start="344.449" dur="4.051">jong-un was going to cancel the summit</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="3.84">which was not the case at all and we see</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="4.379">that the corporate media continually</text>
  <text start="349.819" dur="5.19">pushes out this propaganda to try to</text>
  <text start="352.879" dur="4.051">control the narrative and most of the</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="4.771">time it is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="5.729">false now we see Syria they are taking</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="5.789">the next step remember Assad met with</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="5.76">Putin and they discussed what was going</text>
  <text start="365.569" dur="6.57">to happen in Syria and they were moving</text>
  <text start="368.419" dur="5.521">towards redoing the Constitution so the</text>
  <text start="372.139" dur="3.631">Syrian government they have submitted a</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.4">list of names to the United Nations as</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="5.609">candidates for inclusion in a</text>
  <text start="378.34" dur="6.28">constitutional committee and we see that</text>
  <text start="381.379" dur="5.01">de Mistura has said that he&amp;#39;ll select</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="3.299">around 50 people including supporters of</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="4.291">the government the opposition and</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="3.75">independence to make up this group where</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;re going to create a new</text>
  <text start="391.669" dur="8.161">constitution Syria is on its way of</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="7.15">reworking its political system right now</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="6.209">and all they need to do is get the</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="5.549">foreign elements out of their country</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="5.011">and this is why Trump way back said</text>
  <text start="409.039" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re going to remove the troops from</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="2.28">Syria and I think this is still part of</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="2.071">the plan</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="4.38">I think this is where it&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="6.66">because we can see some hints especially</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="6.03">coming from Lavrov Lavrov had made a</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="5.429">couple of hints when he was talking</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="5.519">about Syrian troops Putin came out there</text>
  <text start="426.889" dur="5.611">and said that all foreign troops even</text>
  <text start="429.259" dur="5.88">Iran should leave Syria now the United</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="6.36">States the deep state they say we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="435.139" dur="6.09">Syria because of a ram and we can see</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="6.149">that Putin is putting all the pieces</text>
  <text start="441.229" dur="7.891">together and making it possible for the</text>
  <text start="445.009" dur="5.821">u.s. to leave Syria and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="4.07">happening right now remember the deep</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="3.419">state has control over this entire</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="2.859">Middle</text>
  <text start="454.249" dur="5.31">East area and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="456.049" dur="7.11">is they&amp;#39;re rearranging everything to</text>
  <text start="459.559" dur="5.91">make it possible to leave this area</text>
  <text start="463.159" dur="4.62">where the deep state all the arguments</text>
  <text start="465.469" dur="6.17">that they used before they can&amp;#39;t use him</text>
  <text start="467.779" dur="7.62">anymore and what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="6.22">Lavrov came out and said that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="475.399" dur="6.09">government should have troops on the</text>
  <text start="477.859" dur="7.44">country&amp;#39;s southern border and according</text>
  <text start="481.489" dur="6.6">to Lavrov the de-escalation zone in the</text>
  <text start="485.299" dur="5.43">south of Syria was established to</text>
  <text start="488.089" dur="5.34">eventually withdraw all non Syrian</text>
  <text start="490.729" dur="5.34">forces from the border areas now this</text>
  <text start="493.429" dur="5.01">was the de-escalation zone that Trump</text>
  <text start="496.069" dur="4.77">and Russia agreed upon to bring peace</text>
  <text start="498.439" dur="4.89">and they&amp;#39;re enforcing it and Lavrov is</text>
  <text start="500.839" dur="6.87">saying that the endgame to all of this</text>
  <text start="503.329" dur="8.791">was to have all non Syrian forces to be</text>
  <text start="507.709" dur="7.74">removed from this area and this is where</text>
  <text start="512.12" dur="9.299">we are headed I think the entire plan</text>
  <text start="515.449" dur="8.791">for all of this is to convince Iran to</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="4.261">leave this area now Iran&amp;#39;s gonna put up</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="2.13">a fight they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="2.909">really good</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="6.089">Putin&amp;#39;s gonna come in the Russians are</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="6.391">gonna talk to Iran Syria right now would</text>
  <text start="532.459" dur="4.771">have to ask Iran okay it&amp;#39;s time to leave</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="4.68">and we see something very interesting</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="5.399">happening right now there are new</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="6.38">reports of an unprecedented indirect</text>
  <text start="542.629" dur="7.111">talks being held between Iran and Israel</text>
  <text start="546.04" dur="7.299">now what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="6.329">Syrian government might ask Iranian</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="6.36">forces to a draw their presence from the</text>
  <text start="556.069" dur="6.51">certain areas in Syria and let the</text>
  <text start="559.699" dur="5.161">Russian troops take control of these</text>
  <text start="562.579" dur="6.24">areas and I think this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="6.18">stages of having Iran withdraw very</text>
  <text start="568.819" dur="4.861">slowly I think Israel is going to back</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="5.609">off slowly and Russia is going to fill</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="6.3">up the gap the deal that was made for</text>
  <text start="576.649" dur="5.91">the entire de-escalation zone around all</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="5.49">the borders I believe this was made</text>
  <text start="582.559" dur="5.611">between Trump and Putin where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="5.01">going to remove their forces</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="3.99">and Russia&amp;#39;s going to move and fill the</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="3.39">vacuum here and control all of these</text>
  <text start="592.16" dur="4.92">areas this is why Putin came out and</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="5.94">said Russia will stay Russia will</text>
  <text start="597.08" dur="6.54">control these areas all other forces</text>
  <text start="599.81" dur="6.84">must leave and this would allow the u.s.</text>
  <text start="603.62" dur="4.05">to leave this area because remember the</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="4.05">Islamic state</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="5.61">al Qaeda Al Shabaab the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="610.7" dur="5.7">and the rest they&amp;#39;re defeated they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.28" dur="5.88">being pushed out they&amp;#39;re being bussed</text>
  <text start="616.4" dur="4.74">out I should say out of the country the</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="4.02">Syrian Armed Forces they&amp;#39;ve been taking</text>
  <text start="621.14" dur="4.59">control of more towns more villages more</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="6.27">serious it ease all the funding has</text>
  <text start="625.73" dur="5.25">stopped to the Kurds all the troops</text>
  <text start="629.45" dur="3.57">there they&amp;#39;re not receiving the funding</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="3.93">but training to all the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="633.02" dur="4.89">has stopped the funding to the white</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="5.52">helmets has stopped and we can see that</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="5.25">everything is being sump in Syria now</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="4.77">the only argument they had was Iran is</text>
  <text start="643.16" dur="5.13">there and we can&amp;#39;t leave if Iran is</text>
  <text start="645.2" dur="6.72">there well Iran eventually will be</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="6.48">leaving once Iran is gone there will be</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="5.79">no more argument in this area and the</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="5.55">troops can come home then Iraq as we</text>
  <text start="657.71" dur="5.34">know they&amp;#39;re going to ask the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="6.06">leave Iraq this is all being set up and</text>
  <text start="663.05" dur="4.95">put into place right now just like the</text>
  <text start="666.38" dur="3.75">North Korean talks I mean everyone was</text>

  <text start="670.13" dur="5.04">good he messed up the talks we see the</text>
  <text start="673.07" dur="3.9">neocons are getting involved and the</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="3.18">talks have completely broken down and</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s going to be war in North Korea</text>

  <text start="744.44" dur="4.44">mindset that no we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="6.21">splitting up Syria and the splitting up</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="6.03">of Syria was the deep state plan this</text>

  <text start="771.05" dur="3.45">still trying to push this goal but we</text>
  <text start="773.15" dur="3.69">see that the pieces now are being</text>
  <text start="774.5" dur="4.41">completely rearranged for something</text>
  <text start="776.84" dur="4.59">completely different than what the deep</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="4.35">state wants and this is all being</text>

  <text start="787.43" dur="4.77">is happening behind the scenes it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="790.1" dur="4.38">to believe it&amp;#39;s hard to get a grip on</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="6.48">all this because we&amp;#39;ve been stuck in</text>
  <text start="794.48" dur="7.32">that whole entire realm of the deep</text>
  <text start="798.68" dur="5.22">state pushing their agenda in these</text>
  <text start="801.8" dur="4.25">areas and that&amp;#39;s the only thing that we</text>
  <text start="803.9" dur="4.35">can see right now but things are</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="5.11">completely changing we can see it with</text>

  <text start="833.42" dur="4.59">war already with North Korea why wait</text>
  <text start="835.67" dur="4.89">what would be the purpose of waiting if</text>
  <text start="838.01" dur="7.08">we&amp;#39;re going to war we would have gone to</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="6.63">war in Syria with the Russians why</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="4.74">didn&amp;#39;t happen if you notice all the</text>
  <text start="847.19" dur="3.96">reports of the u.s. hitting the Russian</text>
  <text start="849.83" dur="1.65">troops turned out to be fake phony and</text>
  <text start="851.15" dur="3.72">false</text>
  <text start="851.48" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s the propaganda outlets doing their</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="3.45">job</text>
  <text start="855.68" dur="4.62">pushing propaganda to make you think</text>
  <text start="858.32" dur="3.53">these things are happening when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="6">really not</text>
  <text start="861.85" dur="7.03">if we were going to go to war why wait</text>
  <text start="866.3" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;s no reason to wait we would have</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="5.31">gone to war a long time ago but every</text>
  <text start="872" dur="5.79">time the deeps they tried to go to war</text>
  <text start="874.19" dur="5.88">Putin shut it down right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="3.96">having peace in North Korea Trump didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.07" dur="3.78">have to have a peace summit</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="5.49">he could have cancelled the whole thing</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="6.33">could have gone with McMasters plan send</text>
  <text start="887.24" dur="5.13">in a 10,000 troops gone to war after he</text>
  <text start="890.18" dur="7.5">bombed Syria we could have sent troops</text>
  <text start="892.37" dur="7.83">in why cut the funding why then cut all</text>
  <text start="897.68" dur="4.74">the funding to all of these different</text>
  <text start="900.2" dur="5.88">groups if we&amp;#39;re going to separate Syria</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="5.64">it makes no sense he&amp;#39;s doing everything</text>
  <text start="906.08" dur="3.87">the opposite of what the deep state was</text>
  <text start="908.06" dur="3.75">doing and it makes no sense to do the</text>
  <text start="909.95" dur="3.93">opposite of what the deep state was</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="4.44">doing if you&amp;#39;re going to follow the same</text>
  <text start="913.88" dur="5.37">path of the deep state it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="916.25" dur="6.029">whatsoever why even call out fake news</text>
  <text start="919.25" dur="5.37">on the corporate media that makes no</text>
  <text start="922.279" dur="5.101">sense either why even have peace in</text>
  <text start="924.62" dur="5.6">North Korea why write this whole entire</text>
  <text start="927.38" dur="9.48">letter saying the peace talks are off</text>
  <text start="930.22" dur="8.65">why do all of this why because the</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="5.13">Patriots are fighting against the deep</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="6.3">state the Patriots are trapping the deep</text>
  <text start="941.99" dur="6.12">state the Patriots are flushing the deep</text>
  <text start="945.17" dur="5.669">stayed out and eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="948.11" dur="4.74">to happen is that the deep state is</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="4.321">going to be cornered and with every</text>
  <text start="952.85" dur="3.84">passing day we see that it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="4.98">harder and harder for the deep state</text>
  <text start="956.69" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re losing the narrative on a lot of</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="2.939">their stories about Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="961.88" dur="4.199">and everything else they&amp;#39;re still trying</text>
  <text start="963.079" dur="5.311">to churn out new propaganda to try to</text>
  <text start="966.079" dur="4.471">you know make a new narrative and try to</text>
  <text start="968.39" dur="5.46">gain the traction but they are losing it</text>
  <text start="970.55" dur="6.659">and what they resort to is what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="973.85" dur="5.94">censorship they try to shut down anyone</text>
  <text start="977.209" dur="5.491">that&amp;#39;s speaking the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="979.79" dur="5.669">they want and if they don&amp;#39;t like it they</text>
  <text start="982.7" dur="6.09">take down channels they censor people</text>
  <text start="985.459" dur="4.111">they arrest people as we can see with</text>
  <text start="988.79" dur="3.84">Tommy</text>
  <text start="989.57" dur="6.69">Robinson who is out in the UK who was</text>
  <text start="992.63" dur="6.21">arrested and we see that this is what</text>
  <text start="996.26" dur="4.89">they resort to because as we move</text>
  <text start="998.84" dur="6.66">towards the endgame they have nothing</text>
  <text start="1001.15" dur="6.69">else left and they still control certain</text>
  <text start="1005.5" dur="3.84">parts of governments they&amp;#39;re still deep</text>
  <text start="1007.84" dur="3.36">state factions out there they still</text>
  <text start="1009.34" dur="3.81">control the corporate media remember</text>
  <text start="1011.2" dur="4.08">they don&amp;#39;t call them the deep state for</text>
  <text start="1013.15" dur="4.08">nothing they&amp;#39;re deeply embedded in all</text>
  <text start="1015.28" dur="4.41">these organizations then there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1017.23" dur="4.47">of individuals that back them and we see</text>
  <text start="1019.69" dur="4.56">right now they are definitely pushing</text>
  <text start="1021.7" dur="5.97">their agenda and they will do whatever</text>
  <text start="1024.25" dur="7.829">they need to do to keep their narrative</text>
  <text start="1027.67" dur="8.58">to keep their end of the story so people</text>
  <text start="1032.079" dur="5.76">believe them and not the Patriots but</text>

  <text start="1037.839" dur="3.631">losing this battle and this is why</text>
