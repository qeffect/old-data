  <text start="99.72" dur="6.87">there and he is pushing once again the</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.101">repeal of Obamacare now we need to</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="5.1">remember that when they push for the</text>
  <text start="109.08" dur="4.98">repeal of Obamacare they were using a</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="4.56">health care plan that was written by</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="4.259">Boehner which was really written by the</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.429">insurance companies passed on to Paul</text>
  <text start="118.319" dur="6">Ryan which is then pushed onto Trump and</text>
  <text start="121.679" dur="5.071">Trump said okay this looks pretty good</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="4.651">let&amp;#39;s use this now did he really think</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="4.259">this was going to pass while he was out</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.5">there saying it&amp;#39;s a great bill but when</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="5.161">we looked at it it was just a reworking</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="3.96">of what we already had and we need</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="3.81">something that is completely different</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="5.1">now I think they should just repeal</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="4.11">Obamacare as of right now we know the</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="3.15">economy is collapsing we know that</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.02">things are falling apart we know that</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="4.919">things are going to be reset and at this</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="4.2">point is it really that big of a</text>
  <text start="150.599" dur="3.661">difference at this point just repeal it</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="4.92">get rid of it and make sure the people</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="6.36">aren&amp;#39;t penalized right now Trump right</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="6.47">now is calling on Americans to push</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="6.93">their congressmen to repeal and replace</text>
  <text start="163.7" dur="7.209">Obamacare and this was announced in a</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="5.88">speech at a factory in Wisconsin so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.909" dur="4.651">renewed his efforts to finish health</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.77">care reform despite calling on lawmakers</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="4.32">to move on to tax reform in the wake of</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.38">leadership pulling the bill due to lack</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="4.38">of votes in March now he understands</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="4.59">that he&amp;#39;s not going to be able to get</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="5.46">the tax reform unless he has the repeal</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="5.46">of Obamacare it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="5.64">and what he needs to understand is that</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="4.74">if you&amp;#39;re going to repeal Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="4.26">replace it you&amp;#39;re going to have to come</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="3.81">up with something incredible that works</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="4.8">for the people not so the insurance</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="5.43">companies not for the government but for</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="5.04">the people and it has to be affordable</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="5.82">it has to give the people what they want</text>
  <text start="209.46" dur="5.43">and if they can&amp;#39;t do that then just</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="4.32">repeal Obamacare because right now with</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="4.02">the penalties and the high premiums it</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="4.41">is just not working and he needs to</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.59">understand this and yes I understand</text>
  <text start="221.16" dur="4.11">that he&amp;#39;s making a call out to the</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="3.5">American public but he needs to</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="5.55">understand that he needs to do his job</text>
  <text start="227" dur="6.43">to support the people in something that</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="5.09">is incredible and this is a very</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="5.85">difficult task to do because you need to</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="5.26">cover many individuals and that&amp;#39;s why it</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="3.03">is very difficult and health care in</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3">other countries where people think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="4.98">free well you have to remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.17" dur="5.58">paying high taxes and we have to</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="5.729">understand that nothing is ever for free</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s always a cost someplace either</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="3.121">they get it through the back end the</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="6.15">front end it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="7.11">there&amp;#39;s always a cost so we need to see</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="4.86">something a lot better for the people</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="4.71">and if it&amp;#39;s really good then it should</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="5.04">be replaced I mean the government</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="6.42">insurance should we be replaced with</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="6.36">this new insurance plan that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="5.76">the people will know that it is good to</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="7.2">go if they can&amp;#39;t do that we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="280.14" dur="5.82">it now it looks like James Comey the man</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.2">who refused to bring charges against</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="4.709">Hillary Clinton despite a mountain of</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="3.96">concrete evidence that she and several</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="5.25">members of her staff knowingly violated</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="6.3">several federal laws apparently used the</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="5.761">largely discredited Trump dossier to</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="4.8">help secure the FISA warrant to secretly</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="4.41">monitor Trump&amp;#39;s former campaign aide</text>
  <text start="303.45" dur="4.95">quarter page and this is according to</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="4.949">CNN very interesting so they just</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="7.69">admitted there was a pfizer warned and</text>
  <text start="311.039" dur="7.331">they were spying on Trump hmm now</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="4.829">think about what is happening here they</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="4.95">think that Trump is on their side they</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="3.691">think that he&amp;#39;s part of the deep state</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="3.99">so they&amp;#39;re coming out with all this</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="6.3">information and actually they&amp;#39;re proving</text>
  <text start="327.31" dur="6.54">him to be absolutely right now the FISA</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="6.229">warrant was for Carter page and it turns</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="6.24">out that Carter page was spied on</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="4.691">illegally and he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="3.66">looks forward to the discovery process</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="4.26">and testimony that will come from the</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="4.59">lawsuit he plans to file in short order</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="5.579">he said I look forward to the Privacy</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.74">Act of 1974 lawsuit that I plan to file</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="4.051">in response to the civil rights</text>
  <text start="353.08" dur="4.589">violations by Obama administration point</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="4.41">these last year the discovery process</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="4.581">will be of great value to the United</text>
  <text start="360.13" dur="4.83">States as our nation hears testimony</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="4.84">from them under oath and we receive</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="6.42">disclosure of the documents which show</text>
  <text start="367.09" dur="7.079">what exactly was done in 2016 so the</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="5.94">walls are closing in around the Obama</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="4.62">administration and this is when we</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="3.48">should become very very nervous because</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="4.261">the deep state does not like to be</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="4.56">called out on anything they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="4.8">what is happening and we could see right</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="5.01">now that they&amp;#39;re going to make a move</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="5.51">most likely because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.94">right now is that things are being</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="5.71">turned around the corporate media</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="4.979">doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s real what&amp;#39;s fake if</text>
  <text start="399.07" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re being fed real information or</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="5.521">fake information actually the</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="5.279">administration has them spiraling out of</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="3.66">control and we&amp;#39;re going to talk about</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="4.801">that a little bit later in this report</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="6.09">but Trump is out there telling paul ryan</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="6.72">right now to get nato to pay their bills</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="6.51">and he wants him out there he wants the</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="5.579">Paul Ryan to tell the nation&amp;#39;s you need</text>
  <text start="423.07" dur="6.659">to pay your bills now there was a report</text>
  <text start="425.889" dur="6.241">that the United States scrambled f-22</text>
  <text start="429.729" dur="4.291">fighter jets to intercept a Russian</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="3.15">strategic bomber near Alaska the</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="4.35">corporate media&amp;#39;s making a very big deal</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="7.47">about this and we see that Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="6.359">tu-95 ms bear it&amp;#39;s a strategic bomber it</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="4.469">was on patrol over the neutral waters</text>
  <text start="444.729" dur="4.321">near Alaska and the aircraft covered</text>
  <text start="447.219" dur="2.491">about 5,000 kilometers at the speed of</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="3.48">about eight</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="5.34">50 km/h and at the height of about</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.96">10,000 meters the flight lasted more</text>
  <text start="455.05" dur="7.47">than seven hours tu-95 ms bomber were</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="6.71">accompanied by 27 minutes of f-22</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="6.27">fighter jets now the long-range bomber</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="5.5">regularly carries out patrol missions</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="5.61">just like the United States bombers they</text>
  <text start="471.7" dur="5.88">also carry out missions Russia&amp;#39;s bomber</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="5.64">was in neutral waters and this is normal</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="5.49">practice where each country will send</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="6.75">their Jets up to escort whatever plane</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="7.44">or ship there is across wherever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="5.82">going and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="490.51" dur="4.38">bomber was in strict compliance with</text>
  <text start="492.61" dur="4.86">international regulations with respect</text>
  <text start="494.89" dur="4.67">to national borders and there really</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="5.22">wasn&amp;#39;t any type of problem but of course</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re making it into a very big deal</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="2.76">they want everyone to say oh look what</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="3.33">Russia is doing they&amp;#39;re flying a bomber</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="4.41">do you know how many missions the United</text>
  <text start="507.55" dur="4.2">States flies along Russia&amp;#39;s borders</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="4.86">through the Baltic states throughout</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="5.13">Europe especially also in the South</text>
  <text start="514.72" dur="4.35">China Sea with China but the corporate</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="4.98">media they really don&amp;#39;t mention this</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="4.62">because they know it&amp;#39;s a non-story this</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="4.02">would make good headlines it&amp;#39;s a story</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="3.96">gets people all riled up oh my god</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="3.93">Russia is coming to get us and this is</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="4.11">what they&amp;#39;re pushing because what do</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="3.33">they want in the end they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="3.12">deep state the part of the knee current</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="5.01">the part of the central bank system they</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.46">want war now it looks like the US Air</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="4.41">Force their planes employed more f-35</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="5.25">Lightning to stealth multi-role fighters</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="4.97">in Europe in the coming days and this is</text>
  <text start="545.59" dur="5.22">according to Captain Mark graph and</text>
  <text start="547.53" dur="5.01">currently six f-35 ASR deployed to</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="4.05">Europe as part of a plan trained</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.21">training deployment to train alongside</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="4.71">us a NATO aircraft stationed in Europe</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="5.73">and a few more are scheduled to arrive</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="6.15">in Europe and we know in the past this</text>
  <text start="562.48" dur="6.12">was a huge buildup to bring military</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="5.01">assets bring military troops into this</text>
  <text start="568.6" dur="4.35">region Eastern Europe the Baltic States</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="5.7">down to the South China Sea the Middle</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="5.61">East Africa because all along the deep</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="4.08">stay at the neocons central bankers they</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="4.94">had been planning for war and they want</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.79">war to cover up this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="4.5">problem is we were we would have been</text>
  <text start="585.3" dur="5.16">already in more if hillary clinton was</text>
  <text start="588" dur="4.8">elected we know that because we could</text>
  <text start="590.46" dur="4.14">see this is where we were headed Trump</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="4.35">was elected and the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="594.6" dur="5.01">deep state the central bank all came out</text>
  <text start="597.15" dur="4.05">and said holy crap how does he get</text>
  <text start="599.61" dur="5.07">elected and they started their campaign</text>
  <text start="601.2" dur="5.25">to try to get rid of him and it looks</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="3.87">like they were having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="4.05">time they were trying to push and he was</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="4.08">pushing from the other side and there</text>
  <text start="610.5" dur="5.79">was a battle going on and this is when</text>
  <text start="612.63" dur="6.33">Trump and the others who want a complete</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="5.13">change decided to change tactics now a</text>
  <text start="618.96" dur="3.78">lot of people can&amp;#39;t see this now many</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="4.53">people say that he&amp;#39;s part of the deep</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="5.04">state he&amp;#39;s with the dark side now if we</text>
  <text start="625.95" dur="4.5">do go to war well we know right there</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="3.9">and then well guess what he is part of</text>
  <text start="630.45" dur="4.92">the deep state he&amp;#39;s with the dark side</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="4.92">and we&amp;#39;re at war at that point is it</text>
  <text start="635.37" dur="2.25">really going to matter at this point no</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="3.3">because we&amp;#39;re going to see missiles</text>
  <text start="637.62" dur="4.41">flying above us and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="639.9" dur="4.2">complete disaster but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="642.03" dur="4.08">interesting is the tactics that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="3.51">using right now and these are the</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="3.54">certain indicators that we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="4.11">right now remember yesterday when we</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="4.11">talked about the aircraft carriers where</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="3.54">when we checked on them they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="3.72">really doing what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="655.26" dur="5.7">was telling us they were doing now the</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="5.88">corporate media has this incredible way</text>
  <text start="660.96" dur="3.99">of just believing the government they</text>
  <text start="663.36" dur="3.3">get the information we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="664.95" dur="3.09">the past with Obama and all the other</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="2.61">presidents where they get the</text>
  <text start="668.04" dur="2.88">information with my government and they</text>
  <text start="669.27" dur="3.36">just print it they just put it out there</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="5.4">and they say this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="672.63" dur="6.54">like it&amp;#39;s fact Trump realize this and if</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="6.15">you notice the corporate media is going</text>
  <text start="679.17" dur="5.34">along with all the propaganda where the</text>
  <text start="682.47" dur="3.87">USS Carl Vinson is on its way the Ronald</text>
  <text start="684.51" dur="4.02">Reagan is on its way the USS Nimitz is</text>
  <text start="686.34" dur="6.21">on its way and we&amp;#39;re going into North</text>
  <text start="688.53" dur="5.4">Korea and again as we see the propaganda</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="6.24">from the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="8.04">Bloomberg put out an article that Korea</text>
  <text start="698.79" dur="5.88">was launching missiles in China I mean</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="4.29">that is very very dangerous but what</text>
  <text start="704.67" dur="2.94">happened was the corporate media maybe</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="4.53">they were listening to alternative media</text>
  <text start="707.61" dur="5.34">where they heard that wait a minute the</text>
  <text start="710.79" dur="4.41">USS Carl Vinson or they may be they did</text>
  <text start="712.95" dur="4.62">some investigation which is pretty</text>
  <text start="715.2" dur="4.62">unlikely they got information that</text>
  <text start="717.57" dur="5.37">the USS Carl Vinson really wasn&amp;#39;t on</text>
  <text start="719.82" dur="4.74">route to North Korea like the White</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="4.11">House set or the Pentagon said wherever</text>
  <text start="724.56" dur="3.87">they got their information and the</text>
  <text start="727.05" dur="4.5">Pentagon the White House had to come out</text>
  <text start="728.43" dur="5.97">and explain away why this wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="731.55" dur="5.73">happening and at this point we can see</text>
  <text start="734.4" dur="6.99">that they are in the process of feeding</text>
  <text start="737.28" dur="7.62">them propaganda to get them to do what</text>
  <text start="741.39" dur="6.33">they want because as we checked we can</text>
  <text start="744.9" dur="5.31">see none of these ships are doing what</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="4.29">they say but the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="750.21" dur="4.47">there saying that this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.01" dur="7.5">happening so we can see there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="754.68" dur="8.43">game going on right now and Russia China</text>
  <text start="759.51" dur="5.97">and the US those in the Trump</text>
  <text start="763.11" dur="5.34">administration those individuals they</text>
  <text start="765.48" dur="7.98">are all working together and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="768.45" dur="7.47">creating this entire covert operation to</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="5.46">trap the deep state and to get rid of</text>
  <text start="775.92" dur="5.1">them once and for all now it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="778.92" dur="5.43">believe it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="781.02" dur="6.54">understand but we can see right now how</text>
  <text start="784.35" dur="5.69">he is playing them right now China is</text>
  <text start="787.56" dur="4.98">saying that there&amp;#39;s a high probability</text>
  <text start="790.04" dur="5.08">that something might happen between</text>
  <text start="792.54" dur="6.09">april twenty fifth and may ninth now</text>
  <text start="795.12" dur="6.27">china says that there&amp;#39;s a pattern and it</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="4.68">suggests provocation as early as two</text>
  <text start="801.39" dur="4.56">weeks before the South Korean</text>
  <text start="803.31" dur="5.19">presidential election on May 9th that</text>
  <text start="805.95" dur="4.95">this two-week window overlaps with North</text>
  <text start="808.5" dur="3.81">Korea&amp;#39;s military foundation day on April</text>
  <text start="810.9" dur="4.14">25th this is why they&amp;#39;re picking this</text>
  <text start="812.31" dur="5.28">timeframe that something might occur and</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="6.09">it looks like they might be setting up</text>
  <text start="817.59" dur="7.02">the deep state for this because as we</text>
  <text start="821.13" dur="7.38">know if there is a missile that is fired</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="6.84">and it shoots down a missile that North</text>
  <text start="828.51" dur="4.92">Korea may can get in the air if they can</text>
  <text start="831.45" dur="5.34">even get one in the air well this is</text>
  <text start="833.43" dur="6">going to really start something now is</text>
  <text start="836.79" dur="5.7">that going to be enough to start World</text>
  <text start="839.43" dur="5.37">War three know what I think is going to</text>
  <text start="842.49" dur="4.83">happen is we&amp;#39;re at this point in time</text>
  <text start="844.8" dur="6.09">where the deep state is very desperate</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="4.07">Russia China the administration here in</text>
  <text start="850.89" dur="2.66">the United State</text>
  <text start="851.39" dur="4.14">they are planning to set up the</text>
  <text start="853.55" dur="4.56">corporate media planning to set up the</text>
  <text start="855.53" dur="6.84">deep state and they want to trap them</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="7.08">they want to weed them out and to trap</text>
  <text start="862.37" dur="4.56">them in what is going on here and this</text>
  <text start="865.19" dur="5.04">is why he&amp;#39;s playing the game right now</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="5.52">to do this and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="870.23" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re feeding the corporate media a</text>
  <text start="872.45" dur="5.79">lot of this propaganda and the corporate</text>
  <text start="875.57" dur="4.41">media is building up war building up all</text>
  <text start="878.24" dur="3.24">these type of talks and all these</text>
  <text start="879.98" dur="4.08">different scenarios that are going to</text>
  <text start="881.48" dur="5.04">happen just like they said 150,000</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="5.01">troops were going into Syria China was</text>
  <text start="886.52" dur="4.56">mounting 150,000 troops on its borders</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re just continually feeding them</text>
  <text start="891.08" dur="6.09">this information and almost all of it is</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="5.04">complete propaganda but the corporate</text>
  <text start="897.17" dur="5.22">media is going along with it now u.s.</text>
  <text start="899.84" dur="5.37">was surveilling North Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear</text>
  <text start="902.39" dur="4.89">test sites from which US officials have</text>
  <text start="905.21" dur="5.34">speculated that a nuclear weapons test</text>
  <text start="907.28" dur="7.02">could be imminent and they have revealed</text>
  <text start="910.55" dur="6.75">a series of intramural volleyball games</text>
  <text start="914.3" dur="6.27">under way among troops stationed on the</text>
  <text start="917.3" dur="5.46">sites and they were completely surprised</text>
  <text start="920.57" dur="4.8">to see that they have volleyball</text>
  <text start="922.76" dur="5.43">tournaments going on where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="6.3">to have a test which makes no sense</text>
  <text start="928.19" dur="5.64">whatsoever so something is going on here</text>
  <text start="931.67" dur="5.04">are there really tests going on in North</text>
  <text start="933.83" dur="5.4">Korea most likely not I think North</text>
  <text start="936.71" dur="4.44">Korea is playing it up I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="3.66">lot of propaganda coming out of the</text>
  <text start="941.15" dur="3.51">corporate media because we need to think</text>
  <text start="942.89" dur="5.01">back at the time where they said there</text>
  <text start="944.66" dur="6.14">was a nuclear test underground but Japan</text>
  <text start="947.9" dur="6.6">never detected any type of radiation and</text>
  <text start="950.8" dur="6.43">again there was no other evidence except</text>
  <text start="954.5" dur="6.96">an earthquake which could have been from</text>
  <text start="957.23" dur="6.36">anything now Trump has ordered the inter</text>
  <text start="961.46" dur="6.38">agencies to review the nuclear deal with</text>
  <text start="963.59" dur="8.06">Iran and he came to the conclusion that</text>
  <text start="967.84" dur="7.15">Iran is following and complying with</text>
  <text start="971.65" dur="6.55">this deal now I know during his campaign</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="5.52">he said this was a complete disaster but</text>
  <text start="978.2" dur="4.86">we need to step back and take a look at</text>
  <text start="980.51" dur="4.389">what just happened here Obama plus</text>
  <text start="983.06" dur="5.249">Russia and other nations were in</text>
  <text start="984.899" dur="7.531">evolved in this P Phi plus one deal Iran</text>
  <text start="988.309" dur="5.861">never had nuclear weapons Iran was</text>
  <text start="992.43" dur="3.8">agreeing to this deal to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="994.17" dur="4.74">sanctions the US the central bankers</text>
  <text start="996.23" dur="6">wanted this deal because they wanted</text>
  <text start="998.91" dur="6.479">Iran to sell their oil on the dollar and</text>
  <text start="1002.23" dur="6.01">it would keep Iran from having a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1005.389" dur="6.51">weapon because their plan eventually was</text>
  <text start="1008.24" dur="6.449">to go into Syria then go into Iran now</text>
  <text start="1011.899" dur="6.6">as Trump speaks to Putin on the Russian</text>
  <text start="1014.689" dur="5.671">side it&amp;#39;s explained to him why this deal</text>
  <text start="1018.499" dur="4.77">is going to be good now think about this</text>
  <text start="1020.36" dur="5.75">for a second if Iran is complying with</text>
  <text start="1023.269" dur="6.57">the deal and they remove the sanctions</text>
  <text start="1026.11" dur="7.78">Iran is no longer a nuclear threat</text>
  <text start="1029.839" dur="6.69">anymore the threat disappears yes they</text>
  <text start="1033.89" dur="4.559">can say there&amp;#39;s still a source of</text>
  <text start="1036.529" dur="4.741">terrorism but we know where all the</text>
  <text start="1038.449" dur="5.25">terrorism is really coming from Saudi</text>
  <text start="1041.27" dur="5.85">Arabia Qatar the United States Israel</text>
  <text start="1043.699" dur="5.641">and many other nations so basically what</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="6.6">Trump has done at this point he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1049.34" dur="6.809">removing the threat from Iran check that</text>
  <text start="1053.72" dur="4.53">off we&amp;#39;re now the neocons the central</text>
  <text start="1056.149" dur="5.16">bankers those who want to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="1058.25" dur="5.85">why they&amp;#39;re complying with everything</text>
  <text start="1061.309" dur="5.041">they have no nuclear weapons they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1064.1" dur="4.29">do anything wrong we can remove the</text>
  <text start="1066.35" dur="6.24">sanctions there&amp;#39;s no reason to have</text>
  <text start="1068.39" dur="6.75">sanctions and again this falls into what</text>
  <text start="1072.59" dur="5.79">he&amp;#39;s trying to do here now Russia</text>
  <text start="1075.14" dur="6.24">supports Iran&amp;#39;s ascension into the</text>
  <text start="1078.38" dur="5.63">Shanghai Cooperation Organization so it</text>
  <text start="1081.38" dur="7.59">looks like Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan</text>
  <text start="1084.01" dur="7.6">Tajikistan Uzbekistan they&amp;#39;re all Russia</text>
  <text start="1088.97" dur="4.589">China of course they&amp;#39;re joining the</text>
  <text start="1091.61" dur="5.189">Shanghai Cooperation and now Iran is</text>
  <text start="1093.559" dur="5.581">joining so things are rapidly changing</text>
  <text start="1096.799" dur="5.61">here and remember Iran is not using the</text>
  <text start="1099.14" dur="6.419">dollar to pay for the oil anymore Trump</text>
  <text start="1102.409" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t care because he knows this</text>
  <text start="1105.559" dur="6.151">system is done we&amp;#39;re not going to use</text>
  <text start="1108.049" dur="6.391">that dollar anymore it&amp;#39;s obsolete when</text>
  <text start="1111.71" dur="5.31">the system comes down something new is</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="4.06">going to be born and it removes the</text>
  <text start="1117.02" dur="3.22">threat so we can</text>
  <text start="1118.5" dur="4.11">see that things are rapidly changing</text>
  <text start="1120.24" dur="6.06">Russia is ready to cooperate with all</text>
  <text start="1122.61" dur="5.91">Libyan political forces in Libya to calm</text>
  <text start="1126.3" dur="4.29">the situation down so think about this</text>
  <text start="1128.52" dur="5.16">for a second we have Russia calming the</text>
  <text start="1130.59" dur="5.58">situation down in Libya we have Russia</text>
  <text start="1133.68" dur="4.41">the US Iran Syria they want to get</text>
  <text start="1136.17" dur="4.92">together and talk about the Syrian peace</text>
  <text start="1138.09" dur="5.97">deal maddis is speaking with Russia to</text>
  <text start="1141.09" dur="5.52">come situation down in Yemen and we have</text>
  <text start="1144.06" dur="4.8">the North Korea situation and this is</text>
  <text start="1146.61" dur="4.98">where things get a little strange</text>
  <text start="1148.86" dur="4.2">because the deep state they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1151.59" dur="3.66">become very very desperate at this point</text>
  <text start="1153.06" dur="4.08">and as they become more and more</text>
  <text start="1155.25" dur="5.28">desperate what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1157.14" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re going to try some type of false</text>
  <text start="1160.53" dur="4.56">flag event where they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1162.81" dur="4.62">something to try to get this war started</text>
  <text start="1165.09" dur="3.69">which means they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1167.43" dur="5.82">something most likely wouldn&amp;#39;t worth</text>
  <text start="1168.78" dur="7.56">Korea how Trump reacts to this will let</text>
  <text start="1173.25" dur="5.85">us know exactly where he stands so the</text>
  <text start="1176.34" dur="5.06">deep state most likely is going to push</text>
  <text start="1179.1" dur="5.34">for a cyber threat is going to push for</text>
  <text start="1181.4" dur="7.12">some type of missile launch or something</text>
  <text start="1184.44" dur="6.87">like that to try to get us into war</text>
  <text start="1188.52" dur="5.82">because they understand this is their</text>
  <text start="1191.31" dur="5.16">last thing they can do now the corporate</text>
  <text start="1194.34" dur="4.29">media they are playing along with this</text>
  <text start="1196.47" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re doing the exact same thing that</text>
  <text start="1198.63" dur="4.49">they did to start the Iraq war to get us</text>
  <text start="1200.97" dur="4.2">into Libya and they&amp;#39;re doing it with</text>
  <text start="1203.12" dur="3.97">Syria and North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1205.17" dur="4.77">continually trying they never give up</text>
  <text start="1207.09" dur="4.32">they keep trying and trying and this is</text>
  <text start="1209.94" dur="3.57">what should make everyone worried about</text>
  <text start="1211.41" dur="3.36">worried right now because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1213.51" dur="3.84">what they&amp;#39;re up to and whatever they</text>
  <text start="1214.77" dur="5.04">going to do it&amp;#39;s going to have to be big</text>
  <text start="1217.35" dur="4.02">and spectacular they just can&amp;#39;t say well</text>
  <text start="1219.81" dur="4.41">we shot down one of the missiles now we</text>
  <text start="1221.37" dur="5.01">need to go and invade it&amp;#39;s not enough so</text>
  <text start="1224.22" dur="6.39">they need to do something spectacular to</text>
