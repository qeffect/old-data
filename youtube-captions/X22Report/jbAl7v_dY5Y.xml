  <text start="41.239" dur="5.39">episode is calm before the storm as</text>
  <text start="43.64" dur="6.18">military assets are moved into place</text>
  <text start="46.629" dur="7.061">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.82" dur="6.03">political and geopolitical news a new</text>
  <text start="53.69" dur="3.72">poll was released today by the National</text>
  <text start="55.85" dur="4.8">Public Radio and the Robert Wood found</text>
  <text start="57.41" dur="5.7">it Johnson Foundation and they looked at</text>
  <text start="60.65" dur="4.92">obamacare and they wanted to know you</text>
  <text start="63.11" dur="5.13">know did this benefit the people how are</text>
  <text start="65.57" dur="4.68">people doing on Obamacare and when they</text>
  <text start="68.24" dur="4.26">took the poll they found out that only</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="4.92">fifteen percent of americans say they</text>
  <text start="72.5" dur="5.659">have benefited from obamacare which is</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="6.33">the Affordable Care Act and we realize</text>
  <text start="78.159" dur="7.96">how this whole entire situation was</text>
  <text start="81.5" dur="7.2">created Obamacare basically is not a</text>
  <text start="86.119" dur="4.651">benefit for the people and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="88.7" dur="4.02">this as time goes on that people are</text>
  <text start="90.77" dur="4.139">paying higher premiums they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="92.72" dur="5.34">less benefits and if you don&amp;#39;t take this</text>
  <text start="94.909" dur="4.861">you&amp;#39;re taxed so it&amp;#39;s all for the benefit</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="3.419">of the people now remember the</text>
  <text start="99.77" dur="4.889">government exempted themselves from this</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="5.46">and they kept their own health insurance</text>
  <text start="104.659" dur="6.121">so if Obamacare is supposed to be so</text>
  <text start="106.939" dur="6.151">great wouldn&amp;#39;t you think our leaders the</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="4.67">ones who are leading us showing us they</text>
  <text start="113.09" dur="4.4">would take it but these aren&amp;#39;t leaders</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="5.26">these people are in it for themselves</text>
  <text start="117.49" dur="7.089">they&amp;#39;re there to make money they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="120.71" dur="7.35">there to support the American people to</text>
  <text start="124.579" dur="6.301">support the United States they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="5.79">to pander to corporations to central</text>
  <text start="130.88" dur="4.47">banks to foreign governments and we see</text>
  <text start="133.85" dur="5.7">right now everything that&amp;#39;s being done</text>
  <text start="135.35" dur="6.6">today is not for the people especially</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="5.07">all this legislation where we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="4.86">more and more of our hard-earned money</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="3.9">taken away from us either through taxes</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="7.16">or hidden taxes and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="5.45">Obamacare is with very few benefits and</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="6.04">when we look at Obamacare it was</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="4.44">completely created to help the health</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="3.04">insurance agents health insurance</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="4.39">companies</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="10.23">to help the government bring in revenue</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="10.61">that&amp;#39;s it now the u.s. marshal they have</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="8.22">been using the Stingray surveillance and</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="9.96">they&amp;#39;ve been using this a lot now what</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="7.02">happened was us USA Today ordered</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="4.03">documents through the Freedom of</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="4.23">Information Act they request a copy for</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="5.36">the agencies log of cases in which</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="7.2">agents had used the Stingray devices and</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="6.67">by accident they gave them the</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="12.93">documentation showing that they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="12.9">this 6,000 times in 2015 and a lot of it</text>
  <text start="213.27" dur="4.71">they didn&amp;#39;t have warrants now we know</text>
  <text start="216.21" dur="3.86">the Department of Justice has now</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="5.07">ordered federal agents to begin</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="4.45">obtaining search warrants before using</text>
  <text start="223.05" dur="4.92">this thing raised but we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="224.52" dur="6.42">this is really happening because before</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="4.71">they felt we didn&amp;#39;t need a warrant we</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.47">can just spy on you whenever we want</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="5.97">well yeah you do look at the Fourth</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="7.53">Amendment and it seems like all these</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="6.24">agencies they do not abide by the Bill</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="4.08">of Rights the Constitution or anything</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="4.44">else they&amp;#39;re just doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="247.02" dur="3.96">want and we know they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="249.33" dur="4.95">they want because the Department of</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="5.46">Justice wouldn&amp;#39;t have to say please get</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="3.54">a warrant and the only reason the</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="3.479">Department of Justice said anything is</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.139">because people complain because people</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="5.851">found out if you notice the government</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="7.291">only reacts when people point things out</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="7.95">on the up when they&amp;#39;re left to their own</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="8.669">they do nothing and this is why when</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="6.449">Obama was uh being pressured about the</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="6.061">NSA which he did nothing about by the</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="6.121">way all that talk nothing happened the</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="5.58">NSA is still doing what they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="6.09">done through different channels that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="6.18">it they&amp;#39;re still spying on the American</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="4.5">people and the only problem now is</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="3.48">encryption</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="5.67">they need to get rid of encryption so</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="6">they have access to everything and this</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="6.9">is not to stop terrorists this is the</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="6.48">spy on every single person now out in</text>
  <text start="309.45" dur="6.54">Ukraine we see Ukraine is completely</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="7.05">falling apart chaos is within the</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="6.57">government it&amp;#39;s getting worse their</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="8.76">currency is collapsing IMF is finding it</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="7.68">hard to keep Kiev funded Yatsenyuk is</text>
  <text start="327.51" dur="4.5">out there he&amp;#39;s saying his government is</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="3.78">under pressure from those seeking to get</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="6.21">power and really what he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="7.26">is the people are trying to push this</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="5.1">puppet government out of power they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="3.87">sick and tired of the puppet government</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="4.47">which was placed in there by the United</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="6.66">States and we see things are starting to</text>
  <text start="347.79" dur="8.61">heat up in Ukraine and it&amp;#39;s only going</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="6.24">to get worse as we move forward now we</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="4.11">know the United States is putting a lot</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="4.5">of pressure on Iran still even though</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="5.43">the p5 plus 1 deal went through</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="5.76">sanctions were released we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="4.35">still making comments about Iran and</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="5.01">their nuclear program remember this has</text>
  <text start="370.29" dur="6.48">nothing to do with nukes this has to do</text>
  <text start="373.32" dur="5.04">with the dollar the central bank their</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="4.65">natural resources and the reason why</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing pressure on Iran once again</text>
  <text start="381.42" dur="5.25">is because Iran said they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="383.46" dur="4.32">to be using the dollar for oil sales</text>
  <text start="386.67" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to be using the euro</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="5.19">temporarily and then most likely move to</text>
  <text start="390" dur="5.82">you want or ruble and the u.s. cannot</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="6.9">have this and they&amp;#39;re looking at their</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="6.41">missile program which do not have nukes</text>
  <text start="399.87" dur="5.79">on top of them and Iran is saying listen</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="6.07">we can develop our missile program we</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t need permission from anyone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="3.99">for two vents capabilities and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="4.65">funny because this is what the u.s.</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="6.96">always says well turkeys allowed to</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="5.58">defend itself Ukraine is allowed to</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="3.87">defend itself but when it comes to other</text>
  <text start="421.35" dur="3.84">countries that don&amp;#39;t have a puppet</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="4.65">government they&amp;#39;re not allowed to defend</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="5.43">themselves they talk out of two sides of</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="9.79">their mouth now we see things</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="10.329">rapidly ramping up in Libya right now we</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="5.909">see the u.s. is continually bombing</text>
  <text start="440.949" dur="4.47">inside of Libya there were additional</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="4.561">air strikes and no group has taken</text>
  <text start="445.419" dur="3.96">responsibility most likely it is the</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="5.37">u.s. because we know they&amp;#39;re in there</text>
  <text start="449.379" dur="5.88">with special forces with the French we</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="2.94">know that they&amp;#39;ve been hitting the</text>
  <text start="455.259" dur="2.671">Islamic state we know where the</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="3.78">president was out there saying that yes</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="3.209">we will be hitting the Islamic state</text>

  <text start="466.84" dur="4.379">going up the Islamic state this is their</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="5.46">cover story but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>

  <text start="481.06" dur="5.609">them in this is what they&amp;#39;re pushing for</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.109">but if this does not work out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.669" dur="5.61">going to go in anyhow so we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="488.439" dur="6.001">reports right now that the UK are going</text>

  <text start="715.97" dur="6.75">to keep this area free and of course</text>
  <text start="720.679" dur="5.88">every time they come out with this idea</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="7.2">that you know someone else is using it</text>
  <text start="726.559" dur="6.45">for a terrorist operation it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="729.92" dur="6.149">the opposite now we see the Syrian truce</text>
  <text start="733.009" dur="6.26">it has been holding when the true</text>
  <text start="736.069" dur="5.67">started this Saturday is past Saturday</text>
  <text start="739.269" dur="7.48">russia decided they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="741.739" dur="7.44">bomb any areas for 24 hours and we see</text>
  <text start="746.749" dur="5.94">that they&amp;#39;re going to resume bombing in</text>
  <text start="749.179" dur="5.58">all different areas now the u.s. is out</text>
  <text start="752.689" dur="4.14">there and they&amp;#39;re saying they will</text>
  <text start="754.759" dur="3.99">continue bombing whoever they deemed to</text>
  <text start="756.829" dur="4.11">be the Islamic state which of course</text>
  <text start="758.749" dur="3.661">this is not what the US is going to be</text>
  <text start="760.939" dur="3.27">bombing they&amp;#39;re going to be using the</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="3.029">cover story that this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="764.209" dur="2.761">bombing because we know the Islamic</text>
  <text start="765.439" dur="3.27">state is the proxy army of the United</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="3.649">States government central bankers so why</text>
  <text start="768.709" dur="4.201">would they bomb their own proxy army</text>
  <text start="770.619" dur="3.97">they wouldn&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s why they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="4.2">been doing it for the last year what</text>
  <text start="774.589" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ll be doing is trying to hit other</text>
  <text start="777.11" dur="6.36">infrastructure and other forces maybe</text>
  <text start="779.959" dur="7.38">asan&amp;#39;s forces and we can see that as</text>
  <text start="783.47" dur="7.979">time goes forward and Russia starts</text>
  <text start="787.339" dur="5.61">bombing the US starts bombing who knows</text>
  <text start="791.449" dur="4.38">if this ceasefire is going to hold</text>
  <text start="792.949" dur="5.911">because we already see fingers being</text>
  <text start="795.829" dur="5.91">pointing pointed in both directions we</text>
  <text start="798.86" dur="6.93">see the Free Syrian Army is saying that</text>
  <text start="801.739" dur="6.921">Assad forces are violating the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="805.79" dur="5.06">we see the opposite happening and</text>
  <text start="808.66" dur="4.479">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;re going to say okay the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="813.139" dur="5.49">is off this is where we seem this is</text>
  <text start="815.66" dur="6.329">headed but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="818.629" dur="8.101">all of this is we know the ceasefire is</text>
  <text start="821.989" dur="6.8">being used for a timeout Russia&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="4">it to stop the forces going after Assad</text>
  <text start="828.789" dur="4.91">which is a good</text>
  <text start="830.73" dur="5.49">move where they still can bomb the</text>
  <text start="833.699" dur="5.7">Islamic state the United States turkey</text>
  <text start="836.22" dur="6.21">the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re using it to</text>
  <text start="839.399" dur="7.43">rearm the Islamic state and the rebels</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="7.2">and bring in humanitarian aid for them</text>
  <text start="846.829" dur="6.461">because they&amp;#39;re preparing for a major</text>
  <text start="849.63" dur="7.889">offensive so defense ministers from the</text>
  <text start="853.29" dur="8.28">us-led coalition discuss the possibility</text>
  <text start="857.519" dur="8.94">of Syrian ground incursion two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="861.57" dur="7.889">in Brussels and they were deciding how</text>
  <text start="866.459" dur="6.031">many troops how they will go and where</text>
  <text start="869.459" dur="8.791">they will go who&amp;#39;s going to participate</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="7.98">and they have drawn up a plan now is</text>
  <text start="878.25" dur="3.75">Saudi Arabia Turkey and the coalition</text>
  <text start="880.47" dur="2.85">forces just going to bring in ground</text>
  <text start="882" dur="4.05">troops well this would be very</text>
  <text start="883.32" dur="5.22">suspicious of why these ground troops</text>
  <text start="886.05" dur="5.7">are basically invading a sovereign</text>
  <text start="888.54" dur="6.9">country it makes no sense whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="891.75" dur="7.8">in the background of all this what do we</text>
  <text start="895.44" dur="6.54">see happening when we know in April this</text>
  <text start="899.55" dur="4.649">is the time frame where Syria&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="901.98" dur="4.71">have the parliamentary elections we know</text>
  <text start="904.199" dur="5.401">the US government central bankers the</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="5.339">coalition forces they really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="909.6" dur="3.81">this to happen because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="912.029" dur="4.881">going to happen the people are going to</text>
  <text start="913.41" dur="6.539">vote for Assad in the sods party and</text>
  <text start="916.91" dur="7.33">this wouldn&amp;#39;t look good just like back</text>
  <text start="919.949" dur="6.811">in June of 2014 where Assad had</text>
  <text start="924.24" dur="4.92">elections eighty-seven percent or so of</text>
  <text start="926.76" dur="4.35">the people voted for him and then of</text>
  <text start="929.16" dur="4.71">course three four weeks later we saw the</text>
  <text start="931.11" dur="5.849">Islamic state all of a sudden appear so</text>
  <text start="933.87" dur="5.49">we know we have this timeframe from now</text>
  <text start="936.959" dur="4.68">until probably May and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="4.2">interesting this coincides with what</text>
  <text start="941.639" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;re going to do in Libya where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="943.56" dur="3.63">hearing that they&amp;#39;re getting ready to go</text>
  <text start="944.88" dur="6.079">in between April and May very</text>
  <text start="947.19" dur="7.92">interesting we have warnings in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="950.959" dur="5.86">now we know Israel is right next to</text>
  <text start="955.11" dur="3.419">Lebanon which most likely they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="956.819" dur="4.26">your forces to get into Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="958.529" dur="6.061">clear the area out because Lebanon</text>
  <text start="961.079" dur="6.391">borders on Syria so we have Lebanon on</text>
  <text start="964.59" dur="4.59">the East Coast we have Iraq where the</text>
  <text start="967.47" dur="4.86">u.s. is telling the US citizens to get</text>
  <text start="969.18" dur="7.02">out of Iraq and they&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>
  <text start="972.33" dur="5.76">forces creating air bases and basically</text>
  <text start="976.2" dur="4.11">taking over some of the air bases there</text>
  <text start="978.09" dur="6.18">and building up the forces we know the</text>
  <text start="980.31" dur="7.02">US on a northern part with Turkey they</text>
  <text start="984.27" dur="6.15">have basically fortified the borders the</text>
  <text start="987.33" dur="6.21">US has an air base inside of Syria and</text>
  <text start="990.42" dur="5.49">Turkey has kept the car door open for</text>
  <text start="993.54" dur="6.03">the Islamic state terrace which they</text>
  <text start="995.91" dur="10.61">support we know that France and Egypt</text>
  <text start="999.57" dur="10.2">their warships are on their way to Libya</text>
  <text start="1006.52" dur="6.4">we know that the US has brought in and</text>
  <text start="1009.77" dur="6.75">fibia swore ships we know the USS Harry</text>
  <text start="1012.92" dur="5.67">Truman is also in the Mediterranean we</text>
  <text start="1016.52" dur="5.88">know the UK has brought in troops on the</text>
  <text start="1018.59" dur="6.72">border of Tunisia we know the french and</text>
  <text start="1022.4" dur="7.11">the us and other coalition forces are</text>
  <text start="1025.31" dur="7.1">already inside of Libya we know that</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="6.96">their drills going on at the same time</text>
  <text start="1032.41" dur="5.98">with the coalition forces and just this</text>
  <text start="1036.47" dur="4.53">past week we know that there are</text>
  <text start="1038.39" dur="4.44">tactical nukes being brought in and</text>
  <text start="1041" dur="5.459">we&amp;#39;re getting word that one was</text>
  <text start="1042.83" dur="6.93">transferred into Syria so we have this</text>
  <text start="1046.459" dur="7.461">ceasefire and we have all of these other</text>
  <text start="1049.76" dur="6.87">things occurring at the same time and</text>
  <text start="1053.92" dur="3.64">basically what this is telling us at</text>
  <text start="1056.63" dur="3.33">this point when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="1057.56" dur="3.75">indicators is something is being</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="7.38">prepared and right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1061.31" dur="9.92">is the calm before the storm everything</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="7.43">being prepared everything being readied</text>
  <text start="1071.23" dur="7.03">having the world look at the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="7.63">saying look it&amp;#39;s working we have peace</text>
  <text start="1078.26" dur="8.3">in the region but it&amp;#39;s impossible for</text>
  <text start="1082.4" dur="9.03">the u.s. to keep this ceasefire going</text>
  <text start="1086.56" dur="9.25">because if they do Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1091.43" dur="6.74">army will push the Islamic state out of</text>
  <text start="1095.81" dur="5.19">Syria</text>
  <text start="1098.17" dur="5.65">that would mean the United States and</text>
  <text start="1101" dur="5.43">the coalition forces they have no reason</text>
  <text start="1103.82" dur="4.44">to be in Syria actually they have no</text>
  <text start="1106.43" dur="3.39">reason to be in Syria right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1108.26" dur="4.92">invaded a sovereign country they never</text>
  <text start="1109.82" dur="6.66">asked permission Russia has been invited</text>
  <text start="1113.18" dur="5.91">into the country big difference here it</text>
  <text start="1116.48" dur="4.26">would be like Mexico coming in or Canada</text>
  <text start="1119.09" dur="2.76">coming into the United States saying oh</text>
  <text start="1120.74" dur="3.26">we&amp;#39;re just going after terrorists don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1121.85" dur="5.69">mind our bombing don&amp;#39;t mind our troops</text>
  <text start="1124" dur="6.64">don&amp;#39;t mind that we took an air base here</text>
  <text start="1127.54" dur="6.76">so we can see at this point they have</text>
  <text start="1130.64" dur="6.33">this window right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1134.3" dur="6.09">preparing and getting ready they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1136.97" dur="7.71">taking this time to prepare for what is</text>
  <text start="1140.39" dur="7.14">coming and we will see the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1144.68" dur="6.3">because we can see right now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1147.53" dur="5.25">to light up their backs the US</text>
  <text start="1150.98" dur="3.54">government central bankers the coalition</text>
  <text start="1152.78" dur="5.18">forces their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="1154.52" dur="7.56">right now they have no other alternative</text>
  <text start="1157.96" dur="7.63">but to go full force and to really light</text>
  <text start="1162.08" dur="7.05">things up here because they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="1165.59" dur="8.85">going to leave because if they just</text>
  <text start="1169.13" dur="9.63">leave the petrodollar collapses the</text>
  <text start="1174.44" dur="7.5">Middle East collapses and when I say</text>
  <text start="1178.76" dur="4.8">collapse their puppet governments not</text>
  <text start="1181.94" dur="4.05">the people the people will take their</text>
  <text start="1183.56" dur="5.19">countries back and they will take over</text>
  <text start="1185.99" dur="5.25">the oil fields they will sell the oil</text>
  <text start="1188.75" dur="6.63">using whatever current say currency they</text>
  <text start="1191.24" dur="5.85">want and when this occurs the entire</text>
  <text start="1195.38" dur="5.4">system falls apart now when the system</text>
  <text start="1197.09" dur="6">falls apart who do we blame ah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1200.78" dur="5.91">going to be completely recognizable</text>
  <text start="1203.09" dur="5.25">who&amp;#39;s at fault here it&amp;#39;s going to be the</text>
  <text start="1206.69" dur="2.97">US government and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1208.34" dur="2.88">because they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="1209.66" dur="3.9">everything&amp;#39;s fine we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="1211.22" dur="4.56">nothing to worry about and then all of a</text>
  <text start="1213.56" dur="7.11">sudden we have a collapse they will not</text>
  <text start="1215.78" dur="7.86">let this happen they want this system to</text>
  <text start="1220.67" dur="5.97">start over they need a war so they can</text>
  <text start="1223.64" dur="5.13">restart the system and this is what</text>
  <text start="1226.64" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing for and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1228.77" dur="2.58">been pushing hard now do all their plans</text>
  <text start="1230.93" dur="3.51">were</text>
  <text start="1231.35" dur="7.02">as we can see from the past no they do</text>
  <text start="1234.44" dur="6.69">not a lot of times other countries step</text>
  <text start="1238.37" dur="5.79">in and their plans go down the drain</text>
  <text start="1241.13" dur="5.549">they reorganized they come up with a new</text>
  <text start="1244.16" dur="6.3">plan but the goal if you notice is</text>
  <text start="1246.679" dur="5.521">always the same so we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1250.46" dur="4.469">to watch this situation very very</text>
  <text start="1252.2" dur="7.29">carefully because if it does not go as</text>
  <text start="1254.929" dur="10.141">planned if they cannot get this war</text>
  <text start="1259.49" dur="10.169">started by having another country start</text>
  <text start="1265.07" dur="7.53">it they will use an event they will use</text>
  <text start="1269.659" dur="5.88">a false flag to make it look like</text>
  <text start="1272.6" dur="6.3">another country or group has created</text>
  <text start="1275.539" dur="4.89">this problem to take all eyes off of the</text>
  <text start="1278.9" dur="3.84">collapse then remember the collapse is</text>
  <text start="1280.429" dur="5.971">not going to stop it&amp;#39;s just going to be</text>
  <text start="1282.74" dur="5.1">covered up by the war there will be hard</text>
  <text start="1286.4" dur="4.17">times here in the united states</text>

  <text start="1303.919" dur="4.411">thin air putting governments into</text>
  <text start="1306.679" dur="5.191">further debt because the system operates</text>
  <text start="1308.33" dur="7.829">in debt and having people go off to war</text>
  <text start="1311.87" dur="7.98">this will cover up who created the</text>
