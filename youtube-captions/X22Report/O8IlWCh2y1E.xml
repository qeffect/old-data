  <text start="419.969" dur="4.861">establishing the areas in Syria they</text>
  <text start="422.999" dur="4.29">want the area of raka this is where</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="4.919">these 200 additional military personnel</text>
  <text start="427.289" dur="5.31">are headed and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="429.749" dur="6.931">they are planning something much larger</text>
  <text start="432.599" dur="7.231">in this area because we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="6.81">huge battle going on in my soul in Iraq</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="6.12">we have boots on the ground there we</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="4.35">have boots on the ground in Syria</text>
  <text start="445.95" dur="4.65">and from for all intents and purposes</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="4.88">the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re on the run so</text>
  <text start="450.6" dur="5.19">one thing they&amp;#39;re doing is a mop-up</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="4.27">mission the other one is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="3.24">planning for something much larger</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="5.31">because we know the Pentagon has created</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="6.33">a whole brand-new force made up of</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="5.37">Syrians and we can see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="6.78">these structures like the al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="6.93">al-nusrah al-sham well most likely</text>
  <text start="472.14" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ll be morphing into this new group</text>
  <text start="474.6" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;ll just say that everyone is</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="3.57">Syrian so out in this area we can see</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="5.73">something is definitely building</text>
  <text start="479.76" dur="7.8">something is about to happen and we see</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="7.47">right now that the Syrian forces they</text>
  <text start="487.56" dur="6.9">found a warehouse filled with chemical</text>
  <text start="491.67" dur="5.73">weapons where the moderate rebels the</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="5.85">Islamic state al Qaeda al-nusrah this is</text>
  <text start="497.4" dur="7.61">where they were creating these weapons</text>

  <text start="505.01" dur="5.08">was owned by Pro Turkish rebel group</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="5.61">known for its participation with</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="5.61">al-nusrah al-qaeda in Syria and it has</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="5.58">connections with the Turkish</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="5.55">organization and all those reports that</text>
  <text start="519.03" dur="4.77">were coming out about chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="5.37">Assad was using them he had to get rid</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="5.4">of his chemical weapons well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="5.7">starting to hear more and more reports</text>
  <text start="529.2" dur="6.15">and the truth is continually coming out</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="4.86">that no these chemical weapons are being</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="3.54">used by the Islamic state the chemical</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="2.91">weapons are being used by the moderate</text>
  <text start="538.89" dur="3.59">rebels the chemical weapons are being</text>
  <text start="540.09" dur="6.84">used by al-nusrah and they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="9.97">manufacturing all of these weapons now</text>
  <text start="546.93" dur="8.04">on Friday we know Obama came out and he</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="5.73">wanted a complete review of what</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="7.88">happened during the elections and we can</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="11.04">see right now there have been leaks from</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="10.21">the CIA and the CIA is saying that that</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="5.91">through their secret assessment they</text>
  <text start="573.06" dur="5.91">have a body of evidence from multiple</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="7.62">sources that it&amp;#39;s quite clear</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="8.01">that Russia hacked the election system</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="6.199">and the US intelligence community</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re so certain that it happened</text>
  <text start="588.949" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;re just a little afraid to go on</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="5.88">record to say that it did this is all</text>
  <text start="593.639" dur="6.271">through anonymous sources and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="7.65">seeing right now is that they really</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="6.9">have no evidence whatsoever a second</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="4.769">leak was released and this was given to</text>
  <text start="606.81" dur="4.86">the New York Times and of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.269" dur="4.531">from an anonymous official asserting</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="3.69">that the Russian hack the republican</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="3.24">national community computer system in</text>
  <text start="615.36" dur="4.2">addition to their hacks on the</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="4.979">democratic organizations but did not</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="5.79">release whatever information they glean</text>
  <text start="622.019" dur="6.18">from the Republican networks and the New</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="4.65">York Times story says that it is also</text>
  <text start="628.199" dur="4.401">far from clear that Russia&amp;#39;s original</text>
  <text start="630" dur="7.17">intent was to support mr. Trump and</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="8.469">maybe just you know undercut the</text>
  <text start="637.17" dur="8.459">confidence and integrity of the voting</text>
  <text start="641.069" dur="6.421">system but again there is no evidence of</text>
  <text start="645.629" dur="4.02">any of these claims this is all</text>
  <text start="647.49" dur="5.069">propaganda right now it&amp;#39;s through</text>
  <text start="649.649" dur="3.75">anonymous sources anonymous people they</text>
  <text start="652.559" dur="3.78">haven&amp;#39;t presented any evidence</text>
  <text start="653.399" dur="4.201">whatsoever but of course through the</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="5.281">core media they&amp;#39;re going to continue to</text>
  <text start="657.6" dur="9.839">tell you that everything is true now</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="7.439">remember the CIA they lie and people say</text>
  <text start="667.439" dur="7.08">well what do you mean what they lie how</text>
  <text start="669.059" dur="9.561">could this be well if you look back in</text>
  <text start="674.519" dur="7.17">time you can see that they have lied</text>
  <text start="678.62" dur="5.709">there&amp;#39;s a report that came out in the</text>

  <text start="704.899" dur="8.051">we can see right now that they like</text>
  <text start="708.3" dur="6.81">quite a bit so let&amp;#39;s break this down</text>
  <text start="712.95" dur="5.24">what is really happening here so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="6.66">go back in time we know that Trump and</text>

  <text start="732.59" dur="6.52">you will concede if you lose the</text>
  <text start="735.27" dur="8.49">elections so at that point they knew</text>
  <text start="739.11" dur="8.52">something right off the bat but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="743.76" dur="7.77">continue now before the elections</text>

  <text start="796.7" dur="4.6">but they were going to use this</text>
  <text start="798.75" dur="4.37">propaganda just in case their</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="3.96">manipulation tactics didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="5.2">Trump was winning in the popular vote</text>
  <text start="805.26" dur="5.25">than they can say that yes Russia did</text>
  <text start="808.32" dur="5.28">hack the election system but their</text>
  <text start="810.51" dur="5.94">manipulation worked Hillary received the</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="5.88">popular vote and remember during this</text>
  <text start="816.45" dur="4.86">period of time jeh Johnson from DHS said</text>
  <text start="819.48" dur="4.17">that DHS was going to monitor the</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="5.85">hacking of the election system in</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="5.4">something like 20 states or so oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="3.84">very interesting about that Georgia</text>
  <text start="829.05" dur="5.43">reported that DHS was trying to hack</text>
  <text start="831" dur="8.64">into their election system because all</text>
  <text start="834.48" dur="6.78">the attempts the IP address was from DHS</text>
  <text start="839.64" dur="5.57">so that&amp;#39;s just very interesting in</text>
  <text start="841.26" dur="5.61">itself so Trump won the electoral</text>
  <text start="845.21" dur="5.62">college vote</text>
  <text start="846.87" dur="8.4">but lost in the popular vote well that</text>
  <text start="850.83" dur="7.44">was phase one phase one during the</text>
  <text start="855.27" dur="6.27">election if Trump was winning the</text>
  <text start="858.27" dur="7.77">popular vote use the Russian card of</text>
  <text start="861.54" dur="6.12">hacking that didn&amp;#39;t happen phase two ok</text>
  <text start="866.04" dur="4.98">before December nineteenth we know the</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="6.05">Electoral College is going to vote on</text>
  <text start="871.02" dur="6.21">who is the next president Jill Stein</text>
  <text start="873.71" dur="5.41">pushed by saw rose by hillary camp came</text>
  <text start="877.23" dur="3.66">out and said we need a recount in these</text>
  <text start="879.12" dur="4.53">three major states Wisconsin</text>
  <text start="880.89" dur="4.59">Pennsylvania Michigan and many of the</text>
  <text start="883.65" dur="4.98">states push back the recount process</text>
  <text start="885.48" dur="6.38">wasn&amp;#39;t working as they wanted it to be</text>
  <text start="888.63" dur="6">they had they wanted it to work out and</text>
  <text start="891.86" dur="6.66">a lot of the states are stopping the</text>
  <text start="894.63" dur="7.47">recounting process now they still need</text>
  <text start="898.52" dur="6.28">to postpone the election the electoral</text>
  <text start="902.1" dur="7.739">count on December nineteenth so the</text>
  <text start="904.8" dur="7.86">recount method didn&amp;#39;t work so they</text>
  <text start="909.839" dur="4.681">realized this and Obama comes out and</text>
  <text start="912.66" dur="5.52">orders an investigation into the</text>
  <text start="914.52" dur="6.66">integrity of our elections now remember</text>
  <text start="918.18" dur="4.44">the elite they still want a war just</text>
  <text start="921.18" dur="6">keep that in the back of your head here</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="9.87">and the he wants the report before Trump</text>
  <text start="927.18" dur="8.69">is inaugurated that&amp;#39;s in January of 2017</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="6.75">january twentieth now a day or two later</text>
  <text start="935.87" dur="6.52">the CIA comes out and they have evidence</text>
  <text start="939.24" dur="5.37">of a cyber attack and it was carried out</text>
  <text start="942.39" dur="4.35">by Russia this was all through anonymous</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="3.51">sources it was leaked to the Washington</text>
  <text start="946.74" dur="5.01">Post and of course we know the</text>
  <text start="948.12" dur="6.48">washington post published a new story</text>
  <text start="951.75" dur="7.56">about fake websites and they amended</text>
  <text start="954.6" dur="6.54">later on that that story was fake so do</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="4.68">we believe this story let&amp;#39;s just go with</text>
  <text start="961.14" dur="4.68">it so they have this anonymous source</text>
  <text start="963.99" dur="4.83">they have leaks they have no proof</text>
  <text start="965.82" dur="6.84">whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="968.82" dur="9.57">that CIA they knew about this yes they</text>
  <text start="972.66" dur="7.74">were hacking so if the CIA report exists</text>
  <text start="978.39" dur="3.6">in the White House knew of it</text>
  <text start="980.4" dur="3.45">why did the administration release a</text>
  <text start="981.99" dur="4.08">statement confirming the fairness of the</text>
  <text start="983.85" dur="5.25">elections right after Stein and Clinton</text>
  <text start="986.07" dur="7.71">began their push for recounts that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.1" dur="7.14">interesting in itself now what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="993.78" dur="5.55">purpose of saying this because the only</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="6.57">manipulation the only thing the hacking</text>
  <text start="999.33" dur="5.61">could do was to allow Trump to get the</text>
  <text start="1002.81" dur="6.6">popular vote but Hillary got the popular</text>
  <text start="1004.94" dur="9">vote so what are they trying to do right</text>
  <text start="1009.41" dur="8.01">now what are what is their agenda what</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="6.27">are they trying to accomplish why bring</text>
  <text start="1017.42" dur="6.93">it up now why they bring it up right</text>
  <text start="1020.21" dur="7.89">after the elections because they want an</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="6">investigation and this will postpone the</text>
  <text start="1028.1" dur="5.19">electoral college voting on December</text>
  <text start="1030.35" dur="8.51">nineteenth this is what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1033.29" dur="12.21">to do right now and this is in phase 2</text>
  <text start="1038.86" dur="8.29">phase 3 let&amp;#39;s say they can&amp;#39;t stop the</text>
  <text start="1045.5" dur="5.88">Electoral College from voting on</text>
  <text start="1047.15" dur="8.04">December nineteenth remember Obama wants</text>
  <text start="1051.38" dur="7.62">this report before Trump is sworn in on</text>
  <text start="1055.19" dur="8.84">january twentieth and if this report</text>
  <text start="1059" dur="9.78">shows that Russia is behind this hacking</text>
  <text start="1064.03" dur="10.9">they&amp;#39;ll use it to say that this election</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="7.65">was completely invalid and remember they</text>
  <text start="1074.93" dur="4.53">most likely are going to show no proof</text>
  <text start="1076.43" dur="5.12">they might show an IP address but that</text>
  <text start="1079.46" dur="4.61">doesn&amp;#39;t link the Russian government</text>
  <text start="1081.55" dur="5.5">anybody can pick out an IP address I</text>
  <text start="1084.07" dur="5.11">mean look back when they use the</text>
  <text start="1087.05" dur="4.92">propaganda with North Korea&amp;#39;s hacking</text>
  <text start="1089.18" dur="5.25">Sony that came out a couple days later</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re completely impossible to track</text>
  <text start="1094.43" dur="5.46">down a state actor that quickly and to</text>
  <text start="1097.82" dur="5.28">actually have real evidence actually</text>
  <text start="1099.89" dur="5.01">they never provided real evidence so if</text>
  <text start="1103.1" dur="4.41">this plan works they accomplish two</text>
  <text start="1104.9" dur="6.02">things the election results are invalid</text>
  <text start="1107.51" dur="6.39">and Trump is not the president and</text>
  <text start="1110.92" dur="7.12">Russia cyber attack the you</text>
  <text start="1113.9" dur="5.7">yes which is an act of war listen</text>
