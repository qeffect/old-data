  <text start="140.47" dur="7.29">six percent have you noticed something</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="6.95">very interesting about all of this have</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="8.99">you noticed that they are really pushing</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="10.539">the statistical information and they are</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="8.38">creating this illusion that all of a</text>
  <text start="161.799" dur="6.991">sudden out of nowhere the economy is</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="6.3">really getting a lot better think about</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="4.08">it before the elections GDP went up to</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="4.5">two point nine percent after the</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="7.67">elections they revised it and went up to</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="6.24">3.2 percent Obama never had a quarter of</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="4.96">GDP above</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="7.73">of 3% the only president throughout</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="7.41">history and all of a sudden he got that</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="6.4">today the unemployment looks incredible</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="8.27">the stock market hitting all-time new</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="7.05">highs I mean can anyone say set up I</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="10.029">mean think about it this is the last</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="11.7">what 60 to 75 days of Obama and all of</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="5.641">this is happening all at once now we</text>
  <text start="215.05" dur="3">know the unemployment numbers and most</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="3.69">of the figures that they throw at us</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated i mean i</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="2.91">can bring down this unemployment number</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="3.78">down to three percent all i got to do is</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="3.539">what take like 1.2 million people say</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re off the job market they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="3.33">looking for jobs and boom I have my own</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.96">my unemployment numbers because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.319" dur="7.771">exactly what they do now they came in</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.14">with numbers like a hundred and seventy</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="4.74">eight thousand people got jobs they were</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="5.129">expecting 180 but there were two big</text>
  <text start="242.83" dur="3.659">surprises one being that the</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="4.711">unemployment rate dropped down to four</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="4.441">point six percent they weren&amp;#39;t expecting</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="4.44">this they were expecting it to stay even</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.16">but they had to manipulate this but the</text>
  <text start="254.14" dur="5.42">other surprise is since everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="7.05">getting all these jobs why did the</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="7.41">hourly earnings drop point one percent</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="6.839">that&amp;#39;s very interesting and the other</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="11.16">interesting thing is is that the labor</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="13.011">force sword 295 million people people</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="9.4">not in the labor force so what they do</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="7.08">well they remove people and said these</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.63">people are not looking for jobs anymore</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="8.92">so the labor force participation rate</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="12.31">went to 60 2.7% the lowest since june</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="9.2">and just shy of a 30-year low so four</text>
  <text start="305.47" dur="5.189">hundred and forty-six thousand people</text>
  <text start="308.19" dur="3.88">you know what they don&amp;#39;t want to pay</text>
  <text start="310.659" dur="3.961">their rent their mortgage they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="3.779">want a new car they don&amp;#39;t want to go out</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="4.379">and purchase</text>
  <text start="315.849" dur="4.71">goods they just given up on looking at a</text>
  <text start="318.999" dur="6.39">job and we have to remember how this is</text>
  <text start="320.559" dur="7.681">done if you have not been on an</text>
  <text start="325.389" dur="6.03">interview with in four weeks they</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="5.549">consider you fallen off you might be</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="5.101">sending your resume out there you might</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="6.6">be saying I want a job but if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="8.209">on an interview guess what you are not</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="6.75">counted which is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="4.84">secondly if you get a part-time job</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s counted as a full-time job if you</text>
  <text start="349.569" dur="5.94">get two part-time jobs you have two</text>
  <text start="352.929" dur="6.151">full-time jobs so this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="5.39">completely manipulated but when we look</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="6.359">at these numbers and we dive into them</text>
  <text start="360.899" dur="6.401">well we see manufacturing it declined</text>
  <text start="365.439" dur="5.641">this is the fourth consecutive month of</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="9.659">declining manufacturing the seventh</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="11.1">decline in the past 10 months since 2014</text>
  <text start="376.959" dur="8.52">the US added 571 thousand waiters and</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="7.139">bartenders and lost 34 thousand</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="5.85">manufacturing workers now the National</text>
  <text start="389.319" dur="5.25">Restaurant Association restaurant</text>
  <text start="391.329" dur="5.971">performance activity index showed in</text>
  <text start="394.569" dur="5.791">October overall industry sentiment is</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="5.699">the worst since the financial crisis due</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="5.479">to declines in both same-store sales and</text>
  <text start="402.999" dur="4.89">customer traffic going to restaurants</text>
  <text start="405.839" dur="6.72">suggesting the restaurant workers should</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="7.92">now be in line for maybe layoffs and</text>
  <text start="412.559" dur="5.86">that&amp;#39;s kind of strange because when you</text>
  <text start="415.809" dur="6.06">look at the BLS data they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="9.78">convince us that people are hiring</text>
  <text start="421.869" dur="8.991">waiters waitresses and bartenders and if</text>
  <text start="428.199" dur="5.46">you really look at this you can see that</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="5.649">starting in march of 2010 and continuing</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="5.701">through September 2016 there has been</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="6.66">just one month in which restaurant</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="6">workers lost jobs jobs for waiters and</text>
  <text start="443.169" dur="6.141">bartenders and waitresses have increased</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="7.1">in 80 out of the past 81 months</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="6.97">that&amp;#39;s kind of strange in itself and</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="7.32">when you look at this since the last</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="7.889">recession going all the way back to 2007</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="7.599">the US has gained 1.8 million waiters</text>
  <text start="464.169" dur="8.661">and bartenders and we&amp;#39;ve lost 1.5</text>
  <text start="467.379" dur="9.831">million manufacturing workers we are a</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="8.82">part-time nation where we&amp;#39;re losing our</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="7.63">manufacturing every single day and</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="6.94">what&amp;#39;s even worse to get these job</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="7.41">numbers we see how they&amp;#39;re doing it the</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="5.94">multiple job holder hit all-time new</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="4.02">highs what that means is a person now</text>
  <text start="494.53" dur="5.25">who just got laid off from their high</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="6.47">paying job has one part-time job to</text>
  <text start="499.78" dur="6.09">part-time job maybe three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="6.639">the household survey revealed that the</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="5.97">number of full-time workers tumbled by a</text>
  <text start="509.379" dur="6.241">hundred and three thousand as part time</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="6.889">workers jumped by 90,000 the trend</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="6.62">continued in November when another</text>
  <text start="518.729" dur="8.381">118,000 part-time jobs were added and</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="9.19">guess what nine thousand full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="6.03">were added very interesting this is how</text>
  <text start="531.43" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re getting their numbers the people</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="6.8">that fall off and people taking multiple</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="6.06">jobs now the divergence is even uglier</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="6.07">when you look at non-seasonal adjusted</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="5.67">jobs here we can see that there were six</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="4.769">hundred and twenty-eight thousand</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="7.68">full-time jobs in November offset by a</text>
  <text start="550.779" dur="6.391">surge in 678 thousand part-time and the</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="3.96">trying to convince us that these were</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="6.45">all in retail I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="10.89">they&amp;#39;re counting the holiday part-time</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="9.57">jobs into these numbers and this is</text>
  <text start="570.64" dur="4.79">completely amazing because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.19" dur="5.88">seeing is people are losing their</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="7.02">full-time jobs and people are getting</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="8.94">there part time jobs</text>
  <text start="582.45" dur="8.079">now we understand that these numbers</text>
  <text start="588.01" dur="5.97">that they throw at us it&amp;#39;s to keep the</text>
  <text start="590.529" dur="5.25">illusion alive and when we look at these</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="5.31">numbers we&amp;#39;ve been tracking these for a</text>
  <text start="595.779" dur="5.791">very long time and we have shown that</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="5.97">this economy right now is in a recession</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="7.23">/ depression and they do this on purpose</text>
  <text start="605.26" dur="5.31">they build the economy up to a point</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="4.49">where everyone believes that everything</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="6.24">is fine because they want everyone in</text>
  <text start="613.29" dur="7.419">this is how they profit from all of this</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="8.12">and of course when the whole thing comes</text>
  <text start="620.709" dur="7.671">down they profit on the way down and</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="7.51">this was all planned from the beginning</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="8.47">they knew the economy could not survive</text>
  <text start="632.44" dur="6.48">as of 2008 they knew they were going to</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="5.179">have to do something so they took the</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="6.45">time they prepared they got ready and</text>
  <text start="642.029" dur="5.921">they kept a solution alive saying that</text>
  <text start="645.37" dur="7.11">the economy is great because they need a</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="6.96">reason to say that the economy crashed</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="3.78">they need to point the fingers could be</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="3.299">the administration the new one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.26" dur="3.42">coming in it can be a country a group it</text>
  <text start="658.209" dur="5.101">doesn&amp;#39;t matter as long as the central</text>
  <text start="659.68" dur="5.12">bank is not blamed because we have to</text>
  <text start="663.31" dur="4.2">remember they just can&amp;#39;t say hey listen</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.33">the economy just fell apart we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.51" dur="2.699">responsible for it and now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="669.13" dur="3">to be moving to a different currency</text>
  <text start="670.209" dur="4.411">they have to make it look like they did</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="5.76">an incredible job they improve the</text>
  <text start="674.62" dur="5.25">economy dramatically and something else</text>
  <text start="677.89" dur="4.319">brought it down but don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.87" dur="5.1">here to save it and the only way to save</text>
  <text start="682.209" dur="4.711">it is to get rid of the dollar and it</text>
  <text start="684.97" dur="4.89">looks like this is the move they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.92" dur="9.06">going to make now in Mexico the central</text>
  <text start="689.86" dur="8.849">bank head he decided to quit and he was</text>
  <text start="695.98" dur="8.79">supposed to be on the central bank until</text>
  <text start="698.709" dur="10.171">20 21 and his name is carstens he&amp;#39;s 58</text>
  <text start="704.77" dur="7.41">years old and for some reason he decided</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="6.149">to take a job with the bank of</text>

  <text start="715.029" dur="6.821">term</text>
  <text start="715.82" dur="9.42">and we can see right now that this could</text>
  <text start="721.85" dur="9.3">be all in preparation for this brand new</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="10.17">system now on December fourth we could</text>
  <text start="731.15" dur="7.89">have a very violent economic shock the</text>

  <text start="746.87" dur="4.35">become the most popular political party</text>
  <text start="748.58" dur="4.59">in Italy it blames the country&amp;#39;s chronic</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.8">lack of growth on the euro currency and</text>
  <text start="753.17" dur="4.98">they promised a hold of a vote to leave</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="6.45">the euro and reinstate Italy&amp;#39;s old</text>

  <text start="762.47" dur="7.35">now that this is going to be a turning</text>

  <text start="769.82" dur="5.19">they vote for this new party well things</text>
  <text start="773.57" dur="3.63">are going to change dramatically</text>

  <text start="782.6" dur="4.44">collapse of the euro zone within a very</text>
  <text start="784.94" dur="4.02">short period it would probably lead to</text>
