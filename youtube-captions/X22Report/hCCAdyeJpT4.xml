  <text start="77.21" dur="5.19">those people on the street they realize</text>
  <text start="79.01" dur="5.63">things are not improving maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.4" dur="6.18">improving for the one percent the elite</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="6.729">because the entire system is focused on</text>

  <text start="102.829" dur="7.411">huge unemployment people are having a</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="5.61">very difficult time getting by and there</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="4.71">are people in Greece who can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="10.621">afford to buy even a loaf of bread that</text>
  <text start="114.95" dur="12.199">cost like 60 cents or 70 cents and we</text>

  <text start="148.37" dur="8.57">here and let it wait for someone who</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="9.95">needs it and we can see from this that</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="6.72">the situation in Greece is rough</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="5.58">here in the United States we have the</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.74">same exact problems no different there</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="6.48">are people on the streets that are</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="9.18">hungry people living in tents and we can</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="9.57">see that as we move forward here and as</text>
  <text start="177.58" dur="8.939">the economy continually contracts as it</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="4.62">continually implodes on itself there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="3.451">going to be more and more of those</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.89">people we saw it back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="4.53">eight people didn&amp;#39;t want to leave their</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="2.88">homes they stayed in their homes even</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="4.5">though they couldn&amp;#39;t have the water on</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="5.64">they couldn&amp;#39;t turn on the lights they</text>
  <text start="199" dur="5.519">weren&amp;#39;t paying in the mortgage they</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="5.4">didn&amp;#39;t leave their homes now in other</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="4.711">cases in California and many other</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="3.869">places where they&amp;#39;re like okay we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="5.75">even make the payments we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="8.131">to leave it and they just walked out and</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="6.45">where did all these people go well many</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="7.14">people how to rent and many other people</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.619">well they lived on the streets but the</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="3.87">government wants us to believe that</text>
  <text start="227.049" dur="4.77">everybody has a job and everything is</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="5.07">fine they came out with their initial</text>
  <text start="231.819" dur="5.401">jobless claims which tumbled to about</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="5.25">two hundred fifty two thousand and this</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="6.96">is the lowest level since 1973 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="6.379">telling us that everyone has a job no</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="6.36">one is claiming unemployment and</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="7.931">everything is fine but when you look at</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="7.949">the US economic growth it&amp;#39;s collapsed</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="8.64">and jobless claims have plunged to</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="8.041">four-decade lows something again doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="6.35">make sense when we look at the is M</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="5.55">employment people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="5.74">when we look at the 2016 GDP growth</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="7.29">expect expectations they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="6.269">revised lower and lower and lower when</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="5.51">we look at manufacturing industrial</text>
  <text start="281.289" dur="7.771">production when we look at the</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="8.469">manipulated data about wage increases</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="5.64">all of this is a lie now something very</text>
  <text start="293.349" dur="2.22">interesting we talked about real estate</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="3.299">quite a bit</text>
  <text start="295.569" dur="4.5">and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking homes we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="297.999" dur="3.361">showing that prices now are coming down</text>
  <text start="300.069" dur="4.201">there are houses that are on the market</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="4.829">that just can&amp;#39;t be moved they can&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.049">them we&amp;#39;re coming out of the summer</text>
  <text start="306.189" dur="4.98">months this is usually the hot season</text>
  <text start="308.319" dur="5.61">for real estate we&amp;#39;re heading into the</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="4.65">winter months and we can see existing</text>
  <text start="313.929" dur="4.89">home sales while they continually</text>
  <text start="315.819" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re continually sliding they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="318.819" dur="7.59">improving july sales of existing homes</text>
  <text start="322.029" dur="5.76">dropped by point nine percent and what</text>
  <text start="326.409" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;ve done is they brought this number</text>
  <text start="327.789" dur="5.22">even lower because they had to revise</text>
  <text start="329.259" dur="7.291">the numbers but was very interesting</text>
  <text start="333.009" dur="8.16">about all of this is that the housing</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="6.659">market normally is based on the</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="4.77">population those people who are getting</text>
  <text start="343.209" dur="4.74">jobs people making money they save their</text>
  <text start="345.939" dur="4.44">money they have the down deposit they go</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="5.101">and they purchase a home and when</text>
  <text start="350.379" dur="6.361">unemployment is low like it is right now</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="8.069">at four point nine percent usually</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="6">housing is moving up in sales more</text>
  <text start="361.119" dur="3.991">people are buying the existing homes</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="4.679">when they buy the existing homes those</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="5.609">people in the existing homes they go and</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="5.61">purchase a new home which allows the new</text>
  <text start="370.719" dur="5.461">the the builders to build the new homes</text>
  <text start="373.029" dur="6.211">and they order lumber flooring and</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="4.889">everything else but we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.349">that because we&amp;#39;re seeing as this</text>
  <text start="381.069" dur="6.84">existing home sales they&amp;#39;re down new</text>
  <text start="383.589" dur="7.651">home construction is down so something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.909" dur="4.68">wrong and lawrence yun from the national</text>
  <text start="391.24" dur="3.659">association of realtors and you have to</text>
  <text start="392.589" dur="5.37">remember lawrence yun back in two</text>
  <text start="394.899" dur="5.49">thousand eight in September going into</text>
  <text start="397.959" dur="5.49">October said that the real estate market</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="6.21">look very strong and when the stock</text>
  <text start="403.449" dur="8.31">market crashed he said it&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="406.599" dur="6.86">little blip and by the winter real</text>
  <text start="411.759" dur="5.731">estate is going to be booming once again</text>
  <text start="413.459" dur="6.221">no he was completely wrong but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="6.06">sitting there today and he&amp;#39;s perplexed</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="9.44">and he said that the recent job growth</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="8.58">is not yielding higher home sales</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="6.04">we have a very healthy labor market in</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="6.27">most of the country and this should be</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="5.67">creating a sustained demand for a home</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="3.93">purchases and he&amp;#39;s sitting there</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="2.61">scratching his head gone I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="4.29">understand why this is not happening</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="6.12">because throughout the past this is what</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="4.92">happens unemployment well like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="4.65">Verret that&amp;#39;s very low people have a lot</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="3.87">of job people have jobs people go out</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="3.3">and they take that money and they</text>
  <text start="455.41" dur="3.42">purchase a home but it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="5.91">this time actually we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="6.57">opposite happened we know why this is</text>
  <text start="463.42" dur="5.22">happening because the unemployment</text>
  <text start="465.4" dur="5.76">numbers they&amp;#39;re manipulated we&amp;#39;re not at</text>
  <text start="468.64" dur="5.91">four point nine percent everyone knows</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="4.8">this well everyone who is not listening</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="5.64">to the corporate media and to the US</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="7.53">government and to the Fed we&amp;#39;re more at</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="6.09">25 maybe up to thirty percent of</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="4.59">unemployment right now and those people</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="3.39">who are getting jobs where the</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="5.34">government counts them as a full-time</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="8.07">job most of them apart time they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="7.23">buying a house anytime soon things are</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="4.74">so bad in the housing market that the</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="3.36">number of new yorkers applying for</text>
  <text start="502.48" dur="7.08">emergency grants to stay in their homes</text>
  <text start="504.01" dur="7.08">is skyrocketing right now because what</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing is there&amp;#39;s a number of</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="4.02">people that are staying in homeless</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="6.54">shelters and that has reached an</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="7.89">all-time high so right now in New York</text>
  <text start="519.34" dur="6.24">there are 80 2306 applications for</text>
  <text start="523" dur="6.18">one-time emergency grants to prevent</text>
  <text start="525.58" dur="6.57">evictions well if the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="7.83">so great why are we seeing a surge in</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="9.06">this because the economy is not what it</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="6.36">seems the economy is doing much much</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="4.64">worse than they&amp;#39;re telling us this is</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="6.17">why we&amp;#39;re seeing something like this and</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="7.15">we we have this incredible indicator</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="6.61">which of course the corporate media will</text>
  <text start="553" dur="7">not mention we have the feds national</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="7.18">activity indicator now</text>
  <text start="560" dur="8.88">this is showing us how the economy is</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="7.53">doing and when it contracts it usually</text>
  <text start="568.88" dur="6">means we&amp;#39;re heading into some type of a</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="9.39">recession well this has been contracting</text>
  <text start="574.88" dur="9.36">for 19 months in a row this is the</text>
  <text start="580.25" dur="7.53">longest period of contraction without a</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="7.92">recession in 49 year history of the</text>
  <text start="587.78" dur="8.97">indicator and it has just crashed to</text>
  <text start="592.16" dur="9.08">negative point five five this is</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="8.31">unbelievable and why is this happening</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="6.51">manipulated data when we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="607.88" dur="12.12">manipulated data like unemployment stock</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="11.13">market precious metals bonds GDP the</text>
  <text start="620" dur="4.41">indicators are showing us that this</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="3.81">economy is not doing well but the</text>
  <text start="624.41" dur="6.96">manipulated numbers that are released by</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="7.53">the government they&amp;#39;re fooling the</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="6.18">population and making them think that</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="5.49">the economy is doing well and of course</text>
  <text start="637.55" dur="4.11">those people who don&amp;#39;t have jobs those</text>
  <text start="639.53" dur="4.62">people have part-time jobs those people</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="4.74">that can barely get by they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.15" dur="4.02">going on here I mean we can see it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.4" dur="5.22">right in front of our eyes housing sales</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="5.43">are down retail is contracting GDP is</text>
  <text start="651.62" dur="4.969">being revised lower and lower and lower</text>
  <text start="653.6" dur="5.85">and we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing jobs lost</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="5.801">corporate defaults are on the rise more</text>
  <text start="659.45" dur="7.32">people are applying for emergency grants</text>
  <text start="662.39" dur="6.66">to stay in their homes we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="666.77" dur="4.35">retail sales their contracting but</text>
  <text start="669.05" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s very interesting also is that the</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="6.12">corporate media while they are pushing</text>
  <text start="673.58" dur="5.31">for this holiday season they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="677.24" dur="4.05">that this holiday season is going to be</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="5.49">one of the best ones ever because stores</text>
  <text start="681.29" dur="5.15">are just hiring people temporarily for</text>
  <text start="684.38" dur="4.86">this holiday season because they expect</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s going to be really great you know</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="4.2">they said the same thing last year and</text>
  <text start="691.12" dur="4.24">they said just wait in</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="5.61">till we have that black friday and cyber</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="6.11">monday but guess what happened it was a</text>
  <text start="699.05" dur="4.59">complete flop and we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="6.25">complete flop this year it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="703.64" dur="6.99">even worse and for all intents and</text>
  <text start="707.72" dur="5.01">purposes we are in a recession right now</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="3.93">actually I think we&amp;#39;re one step further</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="4.65">right now I think we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="4.92">at the beginning of this year I think</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="5.28">now that we&amp;#39;re in September going into</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="5.97">October I think we have just started the</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="4.22">depression and remember the US</text>
  <text start="725.45" dur="3.66">government is not going to mention this</text>
  <text start="726.88" dur="4.36">actually they don&amp;#39;t mention it until</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="5.4">much much later but when we look at this</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="6.14">we can see that things around this</text>
  <text start="734.51" dur="7.35">country around the world it is all</text>
  <text start="737.38" dur="7.18">contracting and they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="7.26">keep the system going a little bit</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="8.85">longer until they can get that event set</text>
  <text start="749.12" dur="6.47">up and have their narrative the way they</text>
