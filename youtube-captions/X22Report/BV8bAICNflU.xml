  <text start="30.64" dur="4.95">name is dave and this is episode number</text>
  <text start="31.96" dur="5.64">98 and the title of this episode is the</text>
  <text start="35.59" dur="5.039">government illusion is giving way to the</text>
  <text start="37.6" dur="5.76">economic collapse and today we see the</text>
  <text start="40.629" dur="6.211">stock market isn&amp;#39;t a positive light gold</text>
  <text start="43.36" dur="7.85">is back up above 1,200 and it&amp;#39;s up about</text>
  <text start="46.84" dur="7.8">30 bucks or so and but then again</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="6.64">everyone all the sleeping people are</text>
  <text start="54.64" dur="6.12">looking at the stock market and looking</text>
  <text start="57.85" dur="4.829">at those type of things but we need to</text>
  <text start="60.76" dur="5.31">look at the actions of the government</text>
  <text start="62.679" dur="5.641">the actions of other governments around</text>
  <text start="66.07" dur="4.58">the world the actions of the central</text>
  <text start="68.32" dur="5.85">bankers the actions of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="7.149">everything else that is not connected to</text>
  <text start="74.17" dur="7.71">the stock market and that will let us</text>
  <text start="77.799" dur="6.96">know what really is going on and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.88" dur="6.47">what we are looking at because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.759" dur="9.47">starting to see things that we normally</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="10.979">wouldn&amp;#39;t see in a free market economy</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="9.761">basically and right now in Argentina</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="8.68">Argentina is a legitimizes black market</text>
  <text start="103.99" dur="9.33">currency with new dollar back CDs and</text>
  <text start="108.009" dur="7.551">these new CDs basically this or this</text>
  <text start="113.32" dur="5.549">article goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="6.01">hyperinflation prone argentina had</text>
  <text start="118.869" dur="4.621">reached epic proportions of disconnect</text>
  <text start="121.57" dur="4.14">from the official rate of exchange to</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="5.31">the US dollar it seems the government</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="5.01">didn&amp;#39;t it didn&amp;#39;t like this and so has</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="5.52">decided to take control of this shadow</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="5.59">economy by creating a new payment method</text>
  <text start="134.32" dur="5.33">and these are called the</text>
  <text start="136.31" dur="8.95">certificate of deposit for investment</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="7.979">and basically their money is worthless</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="6.36">so they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a new</text>
  <text start="147.629" dur="7.621">currency to use to trade them in to be</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.94">the treatment for u.s. dollars and just</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.629">think about it here in the United States</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="7.89">or in the European nations if your</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="5.431">currency becomes worthless what do you</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="4.14">have and it doesn&amp;#39;t really go on to</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="6.33">explain how they get the certificate of</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="8.009">deposit for investments and but if you</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="6.989">had gold and silver I&amp;#39;m sure since gold</text>
  <text start="177.599" dur="7.11">and silver is recognized around the</text>
  <text start="180.629" dur="6.841">world and everyone knows the worth of</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="7.14">gold and silver you would be able to</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="7.94">exchange the gold and silver for US</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="6.691">dollars or for anything that you needed</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="6.07">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now when I say</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="5.789">the actions of the economy we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="7.86">about things that are going on around</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="7.951">the world and in the eurozone over 19</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="5.61">million people are without jobs and</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="5.639">unemployment is hitting a record high</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="7.319">Italy is reporting unemployment is</text>
  <text start="217.919" dur="6.421">hitting a record high and basically the</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="6.111">unemployment across the 17 eurozone</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="7.049">states hit an all-time high in May and</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="7.09">Spain which is grappling with a youth</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="8.07">unemployment has surged up to fifty six</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="5.82">point five percent and Cyprus saw an</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="5.601">unemployment increased to sixteen point</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="7.02">three percent versus 15.8 percent</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="7.6">previously so we&amp;#39;re seeing this move</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="7.95">we&amp;#39;re seeing people without work the</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="6.419">percentage is growing and moving upwards</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="4.71">again in the u.s. you don&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="5.131">this because they change the</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="5.37">unemployment calculation GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.19">and all the other calculations they even</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="3.42">changed the gauge of how they gauge how</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="3.63">many</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="4.95">they need to to lower the unemployment</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="4.38">it used to be a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.1">thousand now it&amp;#39;s only 80 thousand so</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.94">yes what statistics they can continually</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.87">manipulate the the information to</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="6.63">continually keep the illusion that</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="7.75">everything is okay but in reality it is</text>
  <text start="289.98" dur="6">not okay and again they keep the also</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="4.2">they give the illusion with food stamps</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="5.07">which are not really food stamps their</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="5.28">credit card looking cards they you swipe</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="4.5">them just like a credit card and you can</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="4.59">go into any market and buy food and not</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="5.97">one other person would ever notice or</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="8.22">know that you&amp;#39;re on food stamps so they</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="7.53">found a perfect way to disguise and keep</text>
  <text start="315.72" dur="5.82">the illusion going where nobody would</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="6.63">become the wiser when the whole thing</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="6.57">falls apart now Jim want Rogers warns</text>
  <text start="325.68" dur="5.73">were all going to suffer from this crazy</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="5.94">crazy money printing and he goes on to</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="5.46">say we&amp;#39;re getting to that point where</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="5.55">either one of two things are going to</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="6.33">happen either central banks are going to</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="5.73">stop all this money printing or the</text>
  <text start="343.2" dur="5.88">market is going to force them to stop it</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="6.93">it looks like we have it looks like we</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="5.58">may have may be having a juncture of</text>
  <text start="352.26" dur="4.83">both where the Fed is getting worried</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="5.63">and at the same time the market is</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="7.83">jumping in and saying yes it&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="360.29" dur="7.15">what you&amp;#39;re doing and this has to end so</text>
  <text start="364.92" dur="5.16">we may have a healthy convergence of</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="4.89">both and if it&amp;#39;s not ending now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="4.98">going to end sometime in the next year</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="5.73">because this cannot go on it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="7.44">insane and he goes on to say this is the</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="6.54">first time in history where you have all</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="4.41">the central banks in the world printing</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="5.91">money at the same time Europe Japan</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="5.78">America and the UK all are frantically</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="4.71">trying to debase their currency</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="5.26">currencies I&amp;#39;m afraid that in the end</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re all going to suffer perhaps worse</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="5.67">than ever with inflation currency</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="5.1">turmoil and higher interest rates</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="5.7">as I say this has never happened before</text>
  <text start="406.41" dur="5.759">it&amp;#39;s never been a good policy in the</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="4.68">long run so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m afraid we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="5.341">going to suffer for the rest of this</text>
  <text start="414" dur="6.389">decade from this crazy crazy money</text>
  <text start="417.51" dur="4.68">printing if you have money in the</text>
  <text start="420.389" dur="5.31">financial system and the financial</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="6">system collapses he added even though</text>
  <text start="425.699" dur="5.401">you may have done nothing wrong you may</text>
  <text start="428.19" dur="5.22">suffer because somebody else did</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="4.71">something wrong so you need to be very</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="4.62">careful about where your assets are in</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="4.74">the financial system or have strict</text>
  <text start="438.03" dur="5.4">control over them so that you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="5.85">going to lose them and again we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="443.43" dur="6.08">many discussions before about leaving</text>
  <text start="446.4" dur="9">your money in the bank and the dollar</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="7.6">collapsing and basically almost everyone</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="4.139">is telling you to put your money into</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="5.85">gold and silver and I&amp;#39;m doing the same</text>
  <text start="459.539" dur="7.41">thing even know gold is going down I am</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="7.95">considering that this is a huge huge joy</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="5.851">for its sale go out buy some gold if you</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="4.17">can&amp;#39;t afford the gold definitely buy</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="4.79">some silver because silver is really</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="5.97">inexpensive I mean put it this way</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="7.78">silver is you know what is it nineteen</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="6.839">twenty dollars or whatever it is I mean</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="6.09">how many people go out and for the whole</text>
  <text start="487.889" dur="7.111">week by coffee for more than that so you</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="8.07">know you can pick up silver and keep</text>
  <text start="495" dur="8.55">that and stored away because when the</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="7.5"> hits the fan and the bank holidays</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="6.57">come or the cyber attacks come or the</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="5.879">ballons come and you can&amp;#39;t get your</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="5.19">money or the dollar collapses and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.909" dur="7.221">worth noting at least you have something</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="8.729">put away which also should include food</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="6.16">medical supplies water you know</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="5.541">batteries weapons and things like that</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="6.36">but at least you have monetarily</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="5.379">something where you can you you can use</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="4.71">it to purchase or do something with it</text>
  <text start="534.959" dur="5.761">or trade it in later on</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="7.02">when a new system evolves out of the old</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="6.33">system now we can tell again from the</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="5.85">actions and that the illusion is</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="5.4">completely cracking away and the</text>
  <text start="550.23" dur="6.419">economic collapses shining its head</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="7.17">through is that 80 billion leaves bond</text>
  <text start="556.649" dur="5.641">funds a record amount of money poured</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="5.339">out of exchange-traded and mutual bond</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="6.03">funds June according to a fresh report</text>
  <text start="564.959" dur="6.06">by trim labs from tabs nearly double the</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="4.55">amount pulled out of bond funds at the</text>
  <text start="571.019" dur="5.851">height of the financial crisis in</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="6.79">October of 2008 now we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="5.399">happen and since you know people are</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.65">selling there has to be a buyer and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="582.269" dur="5.551">sure the Fed is picking up and</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="6.06">purchasing all these Treasury bonds and</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.07">all these other bonds in stealth mode</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="5.55">and we probably don&amp;#39;t even realize that</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re spending a lot more than the 40</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="3.93">to 45 billion or whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.39" dur="4.5">spending each month because whatever</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="5.63">they tell us it&amp;#39;s usually double or</text>
  <text start="601.89" dur="7.86">triple of what they&amp;#39;re actually doing</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="7.53">now another way that we can tell that</text>
  <text start="609.75" dur="5.82">you know the economic collapse is</text>
  <text start="613.01" dur="4.389">shining its head through and giving</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="4.709">breaking through this illusion that</text>
  <text start="617.399" dur="7.021">everything is okay the there is a</text>
  <text start="620.279" dur="9.06">massive 580 tons of gold purchased in</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="6.93">seven days andrew mcguire told king roll</text>

  <text start="656.279" dur="6.18">seven trading day span in history now</text>
  <text start="659.97" dur="6.72">again we had to remember gold was pushed</text>
  <text start="662.459" dur="6.961">down now for all those suckers who said</text>
  <text start="666.69" dur="4.449">holy crap I better sell my gold started</text>
  <text start="669.42" dur="3.039">to sell their gold and get rid of it</text>
  <text start="671.139" dur="4.35">you know people think it&amp;#39;s in a bubble</text>
  <text start="672.459" dur="5.641">and got to get rid of it and the smart</text>

  <text start="684.22" dur="7.429">would like and it went on sale and you</text>
  <text start="687.549" dur="8.22">should be buying it and but central bank</text>
  <text start="691.649" dur="7.81">bankers were purchasing it you think</text>
  <text start="695.769" dur="7.19">there was something going on here well</text>
  <text start="699.459" dur="6.09">let&amp;#39;s say and i&amp;#39;m going to read here</text>
  <text start="702.959" dur="4.84">basically andrew mcguire is going on to</text>
  <text start="705.549" dur="5.37">say there&amp;#39;s absolutely no physical gold</text>
  <text start="707.799" dur="5.13">for sale mcguire spoke about the</text>
  <text start="710.919" dur="4.86">manipulative take down in the metals</text>
  <text start="712.929" dur="4.231">let&amp;#39;s part let&amp;#39;s start by looking at</text>
  <text start="715.779" dur="3.75">what happened on wednesday morning</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="5.07">because this is really where the</text>
  <text start="719.529" dur="6.3">intervention came in in the very thin</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="6.029">access market in very thin liquidity we</text>
  <text start="725.829" dur="5.461">saw a surgical strike and it would</text>
  <text start="728.259" dur="6.781">design to trip off and accelerate end</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="7.739">quarter position there is no doubt that</text>
  <text start="735.04" dur="6.899">this manipulation was fed back an agent</text>
  <text start="739.029" dur="5.941">boolean bank instigated this is the</text>
  <text start="741.939" dur="5.19">important part these producers have to</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="4.5">balance their books at the end of the</text>
  <text start="747.129" dur="5.3">quarter and these guys were hoping for</text>
  <text start="749.47" dur="5.729">prices above 1300 this was a highly</text>
  <text start="752.429" dur="5.58">predatory move but it enabled these</text>
  <text start="755.199" dur="6.05">bullion banks to go some way towards</text>
  <text start="758.009" dur="7.57">replenishing depleted bullion</text>
  <text start="761.249" dur="6.731">inventories so basically this was on</text>
  <text start="765.579" dur="4.5">purpose which we all know i mean this is</text>

  <text start="1542.04" dur="6.44">basically NSA spying all around the</text>
  <text start="1544.17" dur="6.6">world and they are outright outraged and</text>
  <text start="1548.48" dur="8.05">basically they going to say partners do</text>

  <text start="1598.71" dur="7.26">they want to know what everyone</text>
  <text start="1600.93" dur="6.96">is doing now basically Congress is</text>
  <text start="1605.97" dur="4.86">ignoring the bills to limit NSA spying</text>
  <text start="1607.89" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s amazing when something happens like</text>
  <text start="1610.83" dur="4.17">the World Trade Center goes down the</text>

  <text start="1615" dur="5.46">things we can have thousands of bills</text>
  <text start="1617.43" dur="4.86">run like the Patriot Act go right into</text>
  <text start="1620.46" dur="4.56">the Senate and you know 20 hours later</text>

  <text start="1625.02" dur="3.81">of pages long and it&amp;#39;s past and</text>
  <text start="1627.12" dur="5.46">everything like this but when they learn</text>
  <text start="1628.83" dur="6.54">that the NSA spying is taking place it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1632.58" dur="5.76">slow the bills aren&amp;#39;t getting through</text>
  <text start="1635.37" dur="7.86">their being ignored it&amp;#39;s just amazing to</text>
  <text start="1638.34" dur="9.27">me when the people&amp;#39;s rights are being</text>
  <text start="1643.23" dur="7.14">violated our government our congressmen</text>

  <text start="1656.13" dur="7.16">here now there was an article that says</text>
  <text start="1659.91" dur="7.44">DHS secret assassination squads and</text>
  <text start="1663.29" dur="7.45">basically we know the DHS has been put</text>
  <text start="1667.35" dur="6.69">in place to spy on before during and</text>
  <text start="1670.74" dur="5.72">after the collapse they want to know all</text>
  <text start="1674.04" dur="5.04">the people and basically they have</text>
  <text start="1676.46" dur="5.14">numerous watch list for the police and</text>

  <text start="1718.44" dur="5.94">purchase what they do and this is what</text>
  <text start="1720.87" dur="6.39">all this spying is all about because</text>
  <text start="1724.38" dur="7.77">they need to know where to go how to get</text>
  <text start="1727.26" dur="8.21">them when the time comes now we were</text>
  <text start="1732.15" dur="7.17">talking about false flags talking about</text>
  <text start="1735.47" dur="5.5">Syria the bill being passed and the</text>
  <text start="1739.32" dur="6">Obama administration central bankers</text>
  <text start="1740.97" dur="6.36">cannot let this happen because they need</text>
  <text start="1745.32" dur="4.589">this war to cover up the economic</text>
  <text start="1747.33" dur="7.709">collapse so we have many different false</text>

  <text start="1755.039" dur="5.37">and throughout the summer now the feds</text>
  <text start="1758.669" dur="4.911">are worrying about a July fourth</text>
  <text start="1760.409" dur="6.831">firework bomb there the word about</text>
  <text start="1763.58" dur="7.959">homegrown terrorists and extremists that</text>
  <text start="1767.24" dur="6.25">they can build these firework bombs by</text>
  <text start="1771.539" dur="5.37">learning how to do this on the internet</text>
  <text start="1773.49" dur="6.23">and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very concerned</text>
  <text start="1776.909" dur="6.421">because the Boston bombers were</text>
  <text start="1779.72" dur="5.29">originally planning to bomb New York on</text>
  <text start="1783.33" dur="6.209">the fourth of July but they decided to</text>
  <text start="1785.01" dur="6.18">do it during a patriot day during the</text>
  <text start="1789.539" dur="5.071">marathon and again you know what my</text>
  <text start="1791.19" dur="8.52">theory was on that that the Boston</text>
  <text start="1794.61" dur="8.52">bombing was really to go after the gun</text>
  <text start="1799.71" dur="5.82">owners because the gun legislation was a</text>
  <text start="1803.13" dur="5.61">gun bill was in the Senate they were</text>
  <text start="1805.53" dur="7.04">busy voting on it and if they can make</text>
  <text start="1808.74" dur="7.11">their case that the black powder was a</text>
  <text start="1812.57" dur="6.63">tie too crazy gun owners and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1815.85" dur="6.75">they had that actress she&amp;#39;s supposedly</text>
  <text start="1819.2" dur="6.04">was sending this ricin letter to mayor</text>
  <text start="1822.6" dur="4.829">bloomberg and Obama and she quoted and</text>
  <text start="1825.24" dur="4.35">she said you know I&amp;#39;m a gun loving fool</text>
  <text start="1827.429" dur="3.48">or whatever she said and if you come to</text>
  <text start="1829.59" dur="4.29">my house I&amp;#39;m going to shoot you in my</text>
  <text start="1830.909" dur="4.861">face in your face and it seems like the</text>
  <text start="1833.88" dur="4.58">whole thing was set up to go that way</text>
  <text start="1835.77" dur="8.25">and now they&amp;#39;re building their case</text>
  <text start="1838.46" dur="8.589">because John Kerry and Joe Biden said by</text>
  <text start="1844.02" dur="5.31">August the UN arms treaty and the gun</text>
  <text start="1847.049" dur="4.581">bill legislation will be passed by</text>
  <text start="1849.33" dur="5.16">August so this has to make you think</text>
  <text start="1851.63" dur="10.09">that something is definitely going to</text>
  <text start="1854.49" dur="11.909">happen this this week July third we have</text>
