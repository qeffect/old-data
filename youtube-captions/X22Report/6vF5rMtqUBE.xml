  <text start="318.389" dur="6.03">pushing for this major offensive so</text>
  <text start="322.469" dur="4.71">right now they&amp;#39;re blaming what happened</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="6.2">a couple days ago with the Ukrainians</text>
  <text start="327.179" dur="6.27">security service arresting these</text>

  <text start="339.809" dur="14.4">forward to a false flag now someone in</text>
  <text start="345.929" dur="11.52">Ukraine caught Kiev moving grad rocket</text>
  <text start="354.209" dur="6.781">launchers in Odessa to the contact line</text>
  <text start="357.449" dur="7.86">and they were passing through the</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="6.69">streets it was filmed and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="365.309" dur="4.32">reports that military assets have been</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="4.739">moved up to the contact line where</text>
  <text start="369.629" dur="5.58">Crimea is and now we have it where the</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="5.691">southeastern area is they are getting</text>
  <text start="375.209" dur="6.69">ready for a major major offensive here</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="7.569">now France is saying I well I should say</text>
  <text start="381.899" dur="5.7">a lawmaker in France is saying that we</text>
  <text start="385.679" dur="3.36">need to get rid of the sanctions against</text>
  <text start="387.599" dur="3.75">Russia he presented a draft resolution</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="3.451">to the country&amp;#39;s parliament which is</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="4.261">calling for the lifting of the</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="5.25">anti-russian sanctions the proposed</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="3.719">resolution lists the reasons for getting</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.25">rid of all these sanctions against</text>
  <text start="399.329" dur="8.25">Russia because basically the losses</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="7.429">brought to France are huge because</text>
  <text start="407.579" dur="6.27">basically they have lost forty percent</text>
  <text start="410.419" dur="7">worth of trade with Russia bilateral</text>
  <text start="413.849" dur="8.85">trade and it is really hurting the</text>
  <text start="417.419" dur="10.98">economy but will this pass most likely</text>
  <text start="422.699" dur="7.921">not now the European Union is really</text>
  <text start="428.399" dur="6.841">pushing their weight around</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="7.89">and they don&amp;#39;t care what the European</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="8.37">countries are doing they don&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re going to object to closing the</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="4.98">Borders or keeping them open because the</text>
  <text start="446.1" dur="5.76">European Union is going to take control</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="7.16">of everything they&amp;#39;re going to cancel</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="6.42">national sovereignty and take over each</text>
  <text start="455.75" dur="5.71">one of the countries that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="7.5">doing right now to safeguard the</text>
  <text start="461.46" dur="6.81">Schengen borders so basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="5.4">using grease as a guinea pig because</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="6.269">Greece basically is in the pockets of</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="6.89">the central bankers and because of all</text>
  <text start="474.539" dur="7.071">this austerity and capital controls</text>
  <text start="478.07" dur="6.879">Greece has to do whatever they say and</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="6.72">the eurozone is using every incremental</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="6.331">and produce crisis to cement its power</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="4.75">over the European state sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="4.56">wipe out the cultural and religious</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="5.01">borders Brussels is to propose the</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="4.35">creation of a standing European border</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="5.52">force that could take control of the</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="5.01">blocks external frontiers even if each</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="6.6">one of these countries governments</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="7.519">objects it doesn&amp;#39;t matter this will be</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="4.709">the biggest transfer of sovereignty</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="4.721">since the creation of the single</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="9.271">currency and the first guinea pig is</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="9.93">Greece basically this non-elected group</text>
  <text start="524.19" dur="9.33">of men and women are going to take</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="9.38">control of Europe amazing to fit into</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="7.17">their one world government scenario</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="7.81">right now out in Libya they are saying</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="6.14">that Libya&amp;#39;s rival factions the elected</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="5.58">government and the puppet government</text>
  <text start="546.83" dur="5.53">they have agreed to set a date to sign</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="3.51">the US peace deal now of course this is</text>
  <text start="552.36" dur="3.06">coming from the private west central</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="3.36">banker side where the saying yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.42" dur="3.21">going to get this peace deal yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="3.9">going to sign yes we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="3.329">unity government basically the elected</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="3.48">governments going to give up all their</text>
  <text start="561.959" dur="3.451">powers and we&amp;#39;re going to take it all</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="3.33">going to have to wait and see because</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve seen this many many times before</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="5.43">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="4.68">this is we know and I reported on this a</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="5.61">couple of reports ago where France was</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="6.69">flying planes over Libya they were</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="7.89">reconnaissance missions and right now</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="9.45">the France p.m. is saying that we need</text>
  <text start="586.65" dur="10.02">to go into Libya and crush the Islamic</text>
  <text start="591" dur="7.38">state and we need to wipe them out so</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="4.08">they have already done the</text>
  <text start="598.38" dur="5.7">reconnaissance they already know where</text>
  <text start="600.75" dur="6.12">the factions are they already know where</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="5.25">they need to hit and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="606.87" dur="5.04">to hit the Islamic state that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="609.33" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going after and it seems like</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="8.75">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and ready to go</text>
  <text start="614.31" dur="6.35">into Libya Putin has given the order to</text>
  <text start="620.84" dur="9.91">destroy any threat to the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="8.91">so if anyone fires upon Russia they will</text>
  <text start="630.75" dur="4.86">fight back and defend themselves because</text>
  <text start="633.39" dur="3.69">as the United States always says all</text>
  <text start="635.61" dur="3.21">these countries have a right to defend</text>
  <text start="637.08" dur="4.44">themselves while Russia is turning</text>
  <text start="638.82" dur="6.24">around and saying listen if this happens</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="5.76">once again we will defend our cells</text>
  <text start="645.06" dur="5.07">before when they were doing the bombing</text>
  <text start="647.28" dur="7.02">runs in Syria before the incident with</text>
  <text start="650.13" dur="6.74">the su-24 all of their planes they did</text>
  <text start="654.3" dur="7.95">not have air-to-air missiles at all</text>
  <text start="656.87" dur="7.57">because there was an agreement among</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="5.76">turkey united states and the coalition</text>
  <text start="664.44" dur="6.48">forces that you didn&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="668.01" dur="7.16">about anyone shooting at each other well</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="7.2">we knew eventually the u.s. Turkey NATO</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="6.49">coalition forces they were going to</text>
  <text start="678.12" dur="5.67">start a war somehow and they needed to</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="5.97">push it a little bit more now the</text>
  <text start="683.79" dur="8.25">Russian planes are carrying air-to-air</text>
  <text start="687.63" dur="8.4">missiles which makes the probability of</text>
  <text start="692.04" dur="6.25">an incident that much greater and the US</text>
  <text start="696.03" dur="6.52">and the coalition forces NATO with</text>
  <text start="698.29" dur="8.4">love and incident so they can start the</text>
  <text start="702.55" dur="6.39">war now Carrie says they have some</text>
  <text start="706.69" dur="4.29">issues with the Syrian opposition pack</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re at a meeting and of course</text>
  <text start="710.98" dur="4.62">probably one of the biggest issues is</text>
  <text start="713.11" dur="4.62">that Assad is not stepping down because</text>
  <text start="715.6" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s being left to the people and one</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="5.49">of the requirements is to remove the</text>
  <text start="720.22" dur="8.97">terrorists from Syria and let the people</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="8.82">of Syria go ahead and cast their vote of</text>
  <text start="729.19" dur="7.68">who they want to be their leader now</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="7.109">facade pushes the agenda and removes the</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="4.889">terrorists and liberate the cities and</text>
  <text start="739.149" dur="6.81">towns and freeze the people and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.759" dur="6.871">peace in the land the u.s. is basically</text>
  <text start="745.959" dur="4.831">done for actually there&amp;#39;s no reason why</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="4.17">the US and the coalition forces even</text>
  <text start="750.79" dur="5.13">need to be in Syria at that point and</text>
  <text start="752.8" dur="5.49">remember the US was not invited in there</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="7.71">whatsoever they invaded a country but</text>
  <text start="758.29" dur="8.549">this is not part of their plan this plan</text>
  <text start="763.63" dur="5.16">they have with talking to Russia talking</text>
  <text start="766.839" dur="5.31">to Syria talking to the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="768.79" dur="6.75">is a delay tactic they&amp;#39;re building up</text>
  <text start="772.149" dur="6.331">the forces they have no choice at this</text>
  <text start="775.54" dur="5.43">point but to start an all-out war and</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="5.52">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing now the</text>
  <text start="780.97" dur="6.419">fourth division of the Syrian army they</text>
  <text start="784" dur="7.319">are getting a boost with the Russian t90</text>
  <text start="787.389" dur="6.44">and they&amp;#39;re bringing them in and their</text>

  <text start="1003.33" dur="9.24">right now we are ticking down to a major</text>
  <text start="1008.34" dur="6.69">war the Pentagon right now is saying</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="6.69">because of the Islamic state we need</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="8.06">more bases overseas they&amp;#39;d like to put</text>

  <text start="1034.59" dur="7.38">different countries spanning from Spain</text>

  <text start="1045.69" dur="4.56">coming and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared now</text>

  <text start="1050.25" dur="4.26">events have many different agendas one</text>
  <text start="1052.92" dur="4.41">of them is get the authorization for war</text>
  <text start="1054.51" dur="7.17">past and there&amp;#39;s a couple of them in</text>
  <text start="1057.33" dur="8.37">Congress and the most back bill will</text>
  <text start="1061.68" dur="6.03">authorize a three-year war I mean I know</text>
  <text start="1065.7" dur="4.08">they put a time limit on it but you</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t really put a time limit on a war</text>
  <text start="1069.78" dur="5.13">which makes no sense but the most back</text>
  <text start="1072.36" dur="5.76">bill is the cane flake bill in the</text>
  <text start="1074.91" dur="6.3">Senate which will repeal the previous</text>
  <text start="1078.12" dur="4.77">Iraq war authorization and reauthorize a</text>

  <text start="1085.05" dur="3.24">group and of course what they really</text>
  <text start="1086.94" dur="6.03">means is it going to be going after</text>
  <text start="1088.29" dur="8.25">Russia we have Senator Lindsey Graham he</text>
  <text start="1092.97" dur="6.1">has a authorization for war bill but his</text>
  <text start="1096.54" dur="5.859">is a little different his is</text>
  <text start="1099.07" dur="7.53">open ended with no geographical limits</text>
  <text start="1102.399" dur="5.731">no timetables no prohibitions and the</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="3.87">government can use any force they want</text>
  <text start="1108.13" dur="3.659">makes no difference and guess what</text>
  <text start="1110.47" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s no expiration date or anything</text>
  <text start="1111.789" dur="4.74">like that so they&amp;#39;re definitely getting</text>
  <text start="1114.7" dur="3.569">ready prepared they want to see which</text>
  <text start="1116.529" dur="4.5">one has which one can get the most</text>
  <text start="1118.269" dur="4.89">traction and we&amp;#39;re going to see another</text>
  <text start="1121.029" dur="3.931">event to really push this through</text>
  <text start="1123.159" dur="4.291">because if you notice right after that</text>
  <text start="1124.96" dur="4.41">event guess what happened they started</text>
  <text start="1127.45" dur="4.079">looking at the authorization for bill if</text>
  <text start="1129.37" dur="4.019">been pending there for quite a while we</text>
  <text start="1131.529" dur="4.591">know there&amp;#39;s a couple of them so now</text>
  <text start="1133.389" dur="5.971">they need another one another event full</text>
  <text start="1136.12" dur="4.73">flag event to push these through this is</text>
  <text start="1139.36" dur="3.6">what they&amp;#39;re planning on right now</text>
  <text start="1140.85" dur="4.87">because they need to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="1142.96" dur="6.689">that we need to go after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1145.72" dur="6.179">state now if something very strange we</text>
  <text start="1149.649" dur="4.471">know the San Bernardino this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1151.899" dur="4.471">was a complete false flag their</text>
  <text start="1154.12" dur="4.62">witnesses out there not more than one</text>
  <text start="1156.37" dur="8.22">now saying that yes it was three white</text>
  <text start="1158.74" dur="7.35">tall men dressed up in fatigues the</text>
  <text start="1164.59" dur="3.919">faces were covered except where their</text>
  <text start="1166.09" dur="6.419">eyes were you can tell they were white</text>
  <text start="1168.509" dur="6.821">they were trained they were shooting him</text>

  <text start="1179.74" dur="7.59">terrorists into the group and they</text>
  <text start="1183.25" dur="6.389">basically told him to stop fill it fill</text>
  <text start="1187.33" dur="4.89">haney a US Customs and Border Patrol</text>
  <text start="1189.639" dur="6.051">analyst they said stop what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1192.22" dur="8.51">and they deleted all his intelligence</text>
  <text start="1195.69" dur="7.869">that he was trying to gather basically</text>
  <text start="1200.73" dur="6.25">he was coming up most likely with not</text>
  <text start="1203.559" dur="5.281">much maybe they were he was finding out</text>
  <text start="1206.98" dur="3.75">other things he wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1208.84" dur="7.079">finding out and they came in and they</text>
  <text start="1210.73" dur="7.37">completely deleted everything he even</text>
  <text start="1215.919" dur="4.74">says he was subjected to disciplinary</text>
  <text start="1218.1" dur="5.529">actions when he attempted to blow the</text>
  <text start="1220.659" dur="6.24">whistle on this so there is a cover-up</text>
  <text start="1223.629" dur="4.8">and this tells me that they are planning</text>
  <text start="1226.899" dur="2.971">when I say they it&amp;#39;s United States</text>
  <text start="1228.429" dur="3.591">government central bankers and the</text>

  <text start="1232.02" dur="6.48">FBI all of them planning another false</text>
  <text start="1236.91" dur="3.06">flag and he might have been getting too</text>
  <text start="1238.5" dur="3.93">deep into something he shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1239.97" dur="5.88">been getting into and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1242.43" dur="9.71">everything was completely deleted now</text>
  <text start="1245.85" dur="10.11">Obama is making a move to basically</text>
  <text start="1252.14" dur="6.04">issue a executive order which will</text>
  <text start="1255.96" dur="5.94">bypass Congress completely with no</text>
  <text start="1258.18" dur="6.63">Congress oversight to strengthen</text>
  <text start="1261.9" dur="4.56">background checks and it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1264.81" dur="4.17">going to link this to the no-fly list</text>
  <text start="1266.46" dur="7.77">where the government can choose who and</text>
  <text start="1268.98" dur="7.05">who is not on it and of course basically</text>
  <text start="1274.23" dur="4.8">you don&amp;#39;t know how you get on it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1276.03" dur="5.54">not charged with a crime you&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1281.57" dur="5.77">the government just decides what they</text>
  <text start="1284.25" dur="5.79">want to do that&amp;#39;s dictatorship so eight</text>
  <text start="1287.34" dur="5.61">elect Texas police chief is warning</text>
  <text start="1290.04" dur="7.31">because he&amp;#39;s warning what Obama is doing</text>

  <text start="1313.19" dur="4.87">following the mass shooting of San</text>
  <text start="1315.87" dur="4.89">Bernardino now Kennedy is warning that</text>
  <text start="1318.06" dur="4.95">Obama and as we know he&amp;#39;s trying to take</text>
  <text start="1320.76" dur="3.87">the weapons away from the people saying</text>
  <text start="1323.01" dur="4.25">that this will cause some type of</text>
  <text start="1324.63" dur="4.62">revolution among the American people</text>
  <text start="1327.26" dur="4">adding that the Second Amendment is</text>
  <text start="1329.25" dur="5.1">there to protect us against a government</text>
  <text start="1331.26" dur="4.47">that has overreached its power and this</text>
  <text start="1334.35" dur="3.6">is what the British government tried to</text>
  <text start="1335.73" dur="3.45">do to the founding fathers they came in</text>
  <text start="1337.95" dur="2.64">and they try to take their weapons away</text>
  <text start="1339.18" dur="4.8">and this is what&amp;#39;s really started the</text>
  <text start="1340.59" dur="6.48">revolution and he said you are not our</text>
  <text start="1343.98" dur="5.37">monarch or our ruler sir you are our</text>
  <text start="1347.07" dur="5.16">servant and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="1349.35" dur="5.01">definition of the executive branch the</text>
  <text start="1352.23" dur="3.96">definition is the branch of federal and</text>
  <text start="1354.36" dur="4.83">state government that is broadly</text>

  <text start="1364.65" dur="5.01">the do G by</text>
  <text start="1365.73" dur="5.52">the judicial branch so it&amp;#39;s not a role</text>
  <text start="1369.66" dur="2.97">where the president comes out and says</text>
  <text start="1371.25" dur="4.47">you must do this you must do this</text>
  <text start="1372.63" dur="6.75">because I say so he is like a secretary</text>
  <text start="1375.72" dur="6.03">and he&amp;#39;s just enforcing what we the</text>
  <text start="1379.38" dur="4.71">people want but he&amp;#39;s a little mixed up</text>
  <text start="1381.75" dur="6.99">today and actually every president is a</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="8.07">little mixed up so Kennedy is calling</text>
  <text start="1388.74" dur="7.68">everyone to arms and saying that we</text>
  <text start="1392.16" dur="6.99">should prepare for what is coming be</text>
  <text start="1396.42" dur="7.35">ready he says when the wolf comes to the</text>
  <text start="1399.15" dur="6.42">door because it&amp;#39;s on its way and Kennedy</text>
  <text start="1403.77" dur="3.24">is not the first to warn his citizens</text>
  <text start="1405.57" dur="4.35">law enforcement officials in Arizona</text>
  <text start="1407.01" dur="6.5">Florida and New York also have recently</text>
  <text start="1409.92" dur="9.87">prompted citizens to arm themselves and</text>
  <text start="1413.51" dur="9.28">we can see this movement and this call</text>
  <text start="1419.79" dur="5.73">to action is starting to spread across</text>
  <text start="1422.79" dur="5.82">the country now i&amp;#39;m not telling people</text>

  <text start="1449.4" dur="7.23">reason to come down hard on the people</text>
  <text start="1451.53" dur="8.46">and they would love for any of these</text>
  <text start="1456.63" dur="9.21">people to come out shooting because this</text>
  <text start="1459.99" dur="10.77">is when you&amp;#39;ll see the power of DHS the</text>
