  <text start="52.14" dur="7.23">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="55.99" dur="7.13">x22 report my name is David as episode</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="5.98">1350 2b and today&amp;#39;s date is August 8th</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="5.17">2017 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.35" dur="6.03">behind the scenes plans are being</text>
  <text start="68.29" dur="5.1">formulated let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.38" dur="5.61">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="73.39" dur="6.42">now Obamacare is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="76.99" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="79.81" dur="4.26">goes on and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="81.94" dur="3.929">happen is that most likely hole do you</text>
  <text start="84.07" dur="4.53">see these exchanges they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="85.869" dur="4.921">completely bankrupt there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="88.6" dur="4.95">so many people not taking the insurance</text>
  <text start="90.79" dur="4.5">that they&amp;#39;re going to have to say you</text>
  <text start="93.55" dur="3.99">know something we need to do something</text>
  <text start="95.29" dur="5.82">different but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="97.54" dur="6.329">about Obamacare is that it is really</text>
  <text start="101.11" dur="4.41">destroying the retail sector and I know</text>
  <text start="103.869" dur="3.091">the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="105.52" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on Amazon every time</text>
  <text start="106.96" dur="3.75">you see a report about retail</text>
  <text start="108.88" dur="3.45">brick-and-mortar they said well if the</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="5.07">Amazon effect actually it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="112.33" dur="5.849">Obamacare effect it&amp;#39;s the economy effect</text>
  <text start="115.78" dur="6.02">it&amp;#39;s all of this together because when</text>
  <text start="118.179" dur="7.55">you really look at this online sales</text>
  <text start="121.8" dur="7.45">representative 12% of total retail sales</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="7.061">Amazon comes in at 80 billion in sales</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="7.05">but this merely amounts to just 1.5</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="6.54">percent of total US retail sales since</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="6.36">2016 the total retail sales were around</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="5.61">five point five trillion so when the</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="4.77">corporate media is out there telling you</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="5.22">everything&amp;#39;s going Amazon everything no</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="5.79">that is not true and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="5.97">right now is that a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="3.87">not spending their funds one because</text>
  <text start="156.13" dur="3.99">they don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="157.09" dur="6.03">two they had a full-time job and now</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="5.07">they have a part-time job or maybe two</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="4.41">or three part-time jobs and they barely</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="6.18">make ends meet they&amp;#39;re using their</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="6.57">credit cards just to buy the food buy</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="7.14">what clothing they have and survive</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="7.08">every single day and wages and salaries</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="4.949">have been declining throughout this</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="3.84">period of time the other thing is</text>
  <text start="183.459" dur="3.541">Obamacare the</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="4.14">premiums and they continually move up</text>
  <text start="187" dur="5.46">and up and up and up what happens is</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="6">you&amp;#39;re losing your discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="192.46" dur="5.16">you you don&amp;#39;t have these funds to go</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="6.57">spend in retail so when you put all of</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="8.01">this together this is a major problem</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="7.34">and it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the economy and</text>
  <text start="205.63" dur="8.21">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing over</text>
  <text start="209.07" dur="7.42">time Obamacare has chipped away at</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.51">discretionary dollars and if people are</text>
  <text start="216.49" dur="4.53">making less and wages are coming down</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="5.25">and you&amp;#39;re paying higher premiums and</text>
  <text start="221.02" dur="4.95">higher deductibles well it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="3.75">add to this and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="3.99">major problems when you start putting</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="7.05">all this up together you can see that we</text>
  <text start="229.96" dur="8.37">have this problem and the benefit from</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="5.73">Obamacare well it&amp;#39;s really not for the</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="3.81">people it&amp;#39;s for the insurance company</text>
  <text start="240.13" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s for those in defeat those</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="4.86">individuals in Congress from soldat</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="6.18">those individuals who are benefiting</text>
  <text start="247" dur="6.69">from what has been done here now the</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="5.49">American people okay they are not</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="3.57">benefiting from this yes those people</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="3">who are in subsidies and things like</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="2.82">that where the government is paying</text>
  <text start="258.79" dur="2.88">pretty much all of it</text>
  <text start="260.08" dur="3.69">yes they benefit but that&amp;#39;s a small</text>
  <text start="261.67" dur="5.97">group compared to the rest of the</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="7.17">country and if the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="5.76">the the bulk of the country can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="270.94" dur="5.64">it it&amp;#39;s not a benefit and even if the</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="5.49">premiums were brought down a little bit</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="5.67">you have these high deductibles of three</text>
  <text start="278.89" dur="5.49">or five or ten thousand dollars and you</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="6">need to meet that before the insurance</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="6.18">companies will even chip in so the whole</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="4.74">thing is one complete disaster</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.92">this is why it&amp;#39;s not doing well this is</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="5.1">why the government officials those</text>
  <text start="295.48" dur="4.65">employees decided to exempt themselves</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="4.47">from it because they knew they had</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="4.23">something better and they said to the</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="4.44">rest of the country here you take this</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="4.86">and you should be happy with this but</text>
  <text start="307" dur="3.21">guess what the people are saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="3.87">not happy with this</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="3.45">we don&amp;#39;t want it now we see that Rex</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="2.28">Tillerson</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="5.069">he&amp;#39;s meeting face to face with</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="5.099">Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="4.351">and they&amp;#39;re talking with each other</text>
  <text start="320.469" dur="4.711">about what&amp;#39;s happening in Korea what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.139">happening in the Philippines and human</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="3.06">rights groups are out there and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="327.219" dur="3.961">questioned the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.739">willingness to engage with do dirty and</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="4.259">Tillerson is out there saying that I see</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="4.71">no conflict no conflict at all and are</text>
  <text start="335.439" dur="5.491">helping them with that situation and our</text>
  <text start="337.689" dur="4.801">views of the human rights concerns we</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="3.68">have with respect to how they carry out</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="5.489">their counter-narcotics activities and</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="5.309">we can see right now that in his country</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s the CIA the intelligence</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="4.451">operation where they&amp;#39;re running drugs</text>
  <text start="352.629" dur="3.72">and dirt they came in and said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="4.949">going to stop this and this is why the</text>
  <text start="356.349" dur="5.581">CIA is in there because they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="359.319" dur="5.28">what do-dirty is doing they would like</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="4.949">to have regime change and whenever they</text>
  <text start="364.599" dur="5.85">want regime change they bring in the</text>
  <text start="366.879" dur="7.231">terrorist group they say oh look at this</text>
  <text start="370.449" dur="5.671">he is violating human rights he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="4.529">after these drug smugglers and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="6.329">not nice and they continue on with this</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="7.441">to try to paint a picture of any leader</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="6.631">of being a person who&amp;#39;s a dictator</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="6">who tortures people and if you look at</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="6.44">every country that we had regime change</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="7.799">in this is exactly what they have done</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="5.949">now we can see right now that the US</text>
  <text start="399.879" dur="4.801">Department of Defense they&amp;#39;re weighing a</text>
  <text start="401.469" dur="5.73">new strategy of maybe authorizing</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="6.599">military drone strikes in the</text>
  <text start="407.199" dur="7.53">Philippines now once again do-dirty as</text>
  <text start="411.279" dur="5.461">we can see how he&amp;#39;s not very variable of</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="4.5">the United States being inside of his</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="4.709">country I don&amp;#39;t think at this point he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="3.84">going to say yeah come on in bringing</text>
  <text start="421.449" dur="3.3">your drones because he&amp;#39;s seen what</text>
  <text start="423.069" dur="4.201">happened in other countries he knows</text>
  <text start="424.749" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s happening out in Libya he knows</text>

  <text start="432.249" dur="4.17">countries and what has been happening</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="5.641">where the United States comes in and</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="5.22">uses drone strikes not on the terrorist</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="5.34">groups but on the infrastructure of the</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="6.421">country now the Philippines they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="5.429">denying all of this they&amp;#39;re saying we</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="3.18">have not giving them permission we do</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="2.401">not want them in the country and you</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="3.24">have to remember do</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="4.71">dirty right now and his forces they are</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="4.23">being very strategic in what they are</text>

  <text start="463.3" dur="4.68">going to certain areas and hitting the</text>
  <text start="465.97" dur="4.44">terrorist groups plus they&amp;#39;re giving aid</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="4.32">to those individuals that were just</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="4.32">liberated from the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="5.19">those groups that have been blocked off</text>
  <text start="474.73" dur="6.96">from supplies and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="6.51">time it&amp;#39;s the deep state that wants to</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="4.32">start this up the deep state that wants</text>
  <text start="484" dur="3.99">to get their fingers in the country</text>
  <text start="486.01" dur="4.89">because what they&amp;#39;re really trying to do</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="4.98">is they&amp;#39;re trying to get too dirty now</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="6.84">the Philippine National Democratic Front</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="6.99">has alleged that the US Central</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="6.6">Intelligence Agency have been planning</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="7.35">to kill the exiled leader Jose Maria</text>

  <text start="507.31" dur="3.99">President new dirt egg now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.92" dur="4.17">saying this is going to be a two-stage</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="6.679">plot the first step they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="9.3">going to see a dispatch of a hit team to</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="7.571">the exiled Jose Maria systems home in</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="4.38">the Netherlands and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="5.79">comprised of the elite AFP forces</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="6.24">disguised as disaffected dropouts from</text>
  <text start="531.34" dur="4.29">the New People&amp;#39;s Army the second would</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="3.87">result in the overthrow of do-dirty</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="4.59">for violating human rights in his</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="5.07">ongoing war on drugs and criminality and</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="4.56">this is exactly what the CIA does once</text>
  <text start="542.95" dur="3.51">they start losing control and they want</text>
  <text start="544.78" dur="3.63">control back they start eliminating</text>
  <text start="546.46" dur="5.13">people they bring terrorist groups in</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="5.43">and they create these plans now out in</text>
  <text start="551.59" dur="5.19">North Korea we can see already that</text>
  <text start="553.84" dur="5.61">things are getting out of hand</text>
  <text start="556.78" dur="4.53">we see Daniel gene the national security</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="5.13">adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="6.92">well his party arrived in North Korea</text>
  <text start="564.58" dur="7.97">they&amp;#39;re talking about having the</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="7.42">korean-canadian pastor lim hyeon-soo</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="5.2">released he&amp;#39;s being held in custody by</text>

  <text start="577.75" dur="5.52">on a human humanitarian mission in</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="5.61">January of 2015 and we believe that</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="3.39">Danielle gene the national security</text>
  <text start="585.67" dur="3.38">adviser is there for</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="6.06">other reasons we also see Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="5.469">well he seems to have dropped a</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="4.44">condition for the direct talks between</text>
  <text start="594.519" dur="4.411">Washington and North Korea he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="597.16" dur="4.169">that North Korea must halt its missile</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="4.589">test but that but Tillerson didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="601.329" dur="4.471">mention anything about nuclear testing</text>
  <text start="603.519" dur="3.57">which is very interesting now North</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="2.969">Korea on the other hand which we</text>
  <text start="607.089" dur="3.901">discussed before they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="608.769" dur="5.461">want South Korea and the United States</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="6.959">to stop having these live-fire drills</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="5.19">but once Tillerson said this South Korea</text>
  <text start="617.949" dur="4.981">plus the United States</text>
  <text start="619.42" dur="5.729">they held a live-fire drill near the</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="2.82">worst the western border with North</text>
  <text start="625.149" dur="3.211">Korea</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="4.889">now the live-fire drills were held by</text>

  <text start="674.23" dur="6.63">Korea right now they have entered a new</text>
  <text start="677.199" dur="5.671">stage of the nuclear program and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="4.2">saying that they had North Korea has the</text>
  <text start="682.87" dur="5.909">ability to miniature the nuclear</text>
  <text start="685.06" dur="6.149">warheads now this report is speculating</text>
  <text start="688.779" dur="5.011">that North Korea had improved its</text>
  <text start="691.209" dur="4.291">technological expertise to the point</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="4.289">where it could theoretically marry a</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="4.62">nuclear warhead with a missile now</text>
  <text start="698.079" dur="4.891">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="700.12" dur="5.969">Washington Post they echoed what Japan</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="5.01">said now again we&amp;#39;ve said this before it</text>
  <text start="706.089" dur="3.12">the deep state has control of the</text>
  <text start="707.98" dur="3.24">corporate media they&amp;#39;re all pretty much</text>
  <text start="709.209" dur="4.261">controlled and the source of these</text>
  <text start="711.22" dur="4.5">stories really comes out of the same</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="4.14">exact area and then each news agency</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="4.559">starts to pick it up and they try to</text>
  <text start="717.61" dur="5.159">convince you that since one two</text>
  <text start="720.279" dur="5.341">for news agencies have it it must be</text>
  <text start="722.769" dur="3.63">true well we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="725.62" dur="4.909">right now</text>
  <text start="726.399" dur="7.44">and remember : powell where they said</text>
  <text start="730.529" dur="6.25">Iraq has weapons of mass destruction he</text>
  <text start="733.839" dur="5.401">held up this little you know vial of</text>
  <text start="736.779" dur="4.29">powder saying that yes we&amp;#39;ve confirmed</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="4.409">it that there&amp;#39;s weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="741.069" dur="5.76">destruction and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="743.649" dur="5.641">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="746.829" dur="7.2">same thing being played out where the</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="7.289">deep state they&amp;#39;re pushing this idea now</text>
  <text start="754.029" dur="7.35">Russia on the other hand they are saying</text>
  <text start="756.579" dur="9.06">that they are pretty much years away</text>
  <text start="761.379" dur="6.21">from doing this and they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="765.639" dur="3.5">ability and we&amp;#39;ve been watching them</text>
  <text start="767.589" dur="3.331">fire these missiles they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.139" dur="4.75">intercontinental ballistic missiles</text>
  <text start="770.92" dur="5.88">right now they are medium-range missiles</text>
  <text start="773.889" dur="6.331">that most of the time they blow up</text>
  <text start="776.8" dur="5.67">before they hit the water now the deep</text>
  <text start="780.22" dur="3.839">state didn&amp;#39;t get their way in the UN</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="3.989">remember nikki Haley she was out there</text>
  <text start="784.059" dur="5.851">and she&amp;#39;s saying we&amp;#39;re having no more</text>
  <text start="786.459" dur="5.581">talk we&amp;#39;re done with this and basically</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="4.26">she said there is no point in having an</text>
  <text start="792.04" dur="4.89">emergency session if it produces nothing</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="4.409">of consequence North Korea is already a</text>
  <text start="796.93" dur="3.54">subject to numerous Security Council</text>
  <text start="798.579" dur="3.93">resolutions that they violate with</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="5.159">impunity and that are not complied with</text>
  <text start="802.509" dur="4.711">by all UN member states an additional</text>
  <text start="805.629" dur="3.031">Security Council resolution that does</text>
  <text start="807.22" dur="3.089">not significantly increase the</text>
  <text start="808.66" dur="7.049">international pressure on North Korea is</text>
  <text start="810.309" dur="6.03">of no value guess what she didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="815.709" dur="5.641">her way</text>
  <text start="816.339" dur="8.821">guess who got its way China and Russia</text>
  <text start="821.35" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;re the ones who decided no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="6.659">going to play sanctions on North Korea</text>
  <text start="826.809" dur="7.47">and we&amp;#39;re going to have talks so the US</text>
  <text start="831.819" dur="4.83">was completely shot down actually the</text>
  <text start="834.279" dur="5.941">deep state was completely shot down and</text>
  <text start="836.649" dur="6.56">Russia and China took control of the</text>
  <text start="840.22" dur="6.359">situation and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="843.209" dur="6.37">China is getting its way on North Korea</text>
  <text start="846.579" dur="4.62">along with Russia even though the deep</text>
  <text start="849.579" dur="4.531">state wants to do something very</text>
  <text start="851.199" dur="6.061">different and I think this is why we are</text>
  <text start="854.11" dur="6.18">seeing all these stories right now about</text>
  <text start="857.26" dur="5.25">how North Korea has a miniature nuclear</text>
  <text start="860.29" dur="4.56">weapon how they can place it on a</text>
  <text start="862.51" dur="5.97">missile and let&amp;#39;s say they do have this</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="6.9">right now well that says that they are a</text>
  <text start="868.48" dur="5.76">nuclear power and regime change</text>
  <text start="871.75" dur="6.42">going into this country is going to be</text>
  <text start="874.24" dur="7.409">pretty much out of the question and we</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="6.87">know if they actually do have this any</text>
  <text start="881.649" dur="6.841">type of invasion they&amp;#39;re going to fire</text>
  <text start="885.04" dur="5.37">it off and kill many people in South</text>
  <text start="888.49" dur="5.25">Korea and this is going to lead to a</text>
  <text start="890.41" dur="6.21">nuclear war so when we look at this at</text>
  <text start="893.74" dur="5.73">both sides it&amp;#39;s a no-win situation and</text>
  <text start="896.62" dur="5.1">China and Russia they&amp;#39;re trying to take</text>
  <text start="899.47" dur="6.51">control of the situation they just pull</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="6.27">this away from the deep state in the UN</text>
  <text start="905.98" dur="4.32">right now now a couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="907.99" dur="4.11">talked about this how when the deep</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="3.479">state is backed against the corner and</text>
  <text start="912.1" dur="4.979">it looks like things are not going well</text>
  <text start="913.779" dur="6.691">for them they might resort to a false</text>
  <text start="917.079" dur="6.841">flag now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="920.47" dur="6.299">this next story is that nikki Haley was</text>
  <text start="923.92" dur="5.609">talking about North Korea and this new</text>
  <text start="926.769" dur="7.971">report that I believe Fox News was</text>
  <text start="929.529" dur="9">carrying about North Korea loading up</text>
  <text start="934.74" dur="7.3">their patrol boats with two anti-ship</text>
  <text start="938.529" dur="6.391">cruise missiles and they spoke to nikki</text>
  <text start="942.04" dur="5.07">Haley about this and she said that you</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="3.539">know this is classified information we</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="5.46">really can&amp;#39;t talk about this</text>
  <text start="948.459" dur="5.88">but Trump he tweeted out the fox news</text>
  <text start="952.57" dur="4.829">story that reported that US spy agency</text>
  <text start="954.339" dur="5.221">detected via satellite that North Korea</text>
  <text start="957.399" dur="5.761">regime was loading two anti-ship cruise</text>
  <text start="959.56" dur="5.639">missiles on a patrol boat on the country</text>
  <text start="963.16" dur="6.2">east coast these missiles had not been</text>
  <text start="965.199" dur="8.13">on this type of craft since 2014 now</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="7.33">most likely I think this was going to be</text>
  <text start="973.329" dur="6.331">set up for some type of false flag event</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="6.75">and Trump came out there and decided</text>
  <text start="979.66" dur="6.81">once again to put this out in the open</text>
  <text start="983.44" dur="4.53">and I think that the deep state was</text>
  <text start="986.47" dur="3.03">definitely planning something</text>
  <text start="987.97" dur="4.38">they were trying to make this look like</text>
  <text start="989.5" dur="4.98">you know North Korea was about to do</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="3.779">something they were up to something</text>
  <text start="994.48" dur="3.359">they were putting missiles on a patrol</text>
  <text start="996.129" dur="4.2">boat we don&amp;#39;t know what they were trying</text>
  <text start="997.839" dur="5.581">to do they were setting things up and I</text>
  <text start="1000.329" dur="5.31">believe that this was again one of those</text>
  <text start="1003.42" dur="3.93">things that we saw in Syria where they</text>
  <text start="1005.639" dur="3.781">said you know it looks like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.35" dur="3.45">another chemical attack and the Trump</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="3.719">administration was just out there and</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="4.17">they blurted something out there to stop</text>
  <text start="1013.139" dur="3.87">this from happening I think that was a</text>
  <text start="1014.97" dur="5.039">false flag event and I think the same</text>
  <text start="1017.009" dur="4.89">thing is happening once again and I</text>
  <text start="1020.009" dur="4.351">think we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen</text>
  <text start="1021.899" dur="4.831">many many times because the deep state</text>
  <text start="1024.36" dur="4.29">they are definitely getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="3.929">something because we can see their backs</text>
  <text start="1028.65" dur="2.789">are against the wall because what is</text>
  <text start="1030.659" dur="3.93">happening right now</text>
  <text start="1031.439" dur="6.87">well the Islamic state their reign is</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="5.281">over in central Syria they&amp;#39;re coming to</text>
  <text start="1038.309" dur="4.53">an end right now they are being</text>
  <text start="1039.87" dur="5.789">surrounded and squeezed and we can see</text>
  <text start="1042.839" dur="7.051">this is definitely happening we see that</text>
  <text start="1045.659" dur="7.411">the US presence at the alt has mace well</text>
  <text start="1049.89" dur="5.279">it looks like they might be working with</text>
  <text start="1053.07" dur="5.7">Russia right now to maybe</text>
  <text start="1055.169" dur="6.541">hand this over to the Russian military</text>
  <text start="1058.77" dur="6.51">and they would take this over right now</text>
  <text start="1061.71" dur="5.579">there&amp;#39;s a lot of plans going on that are</text>
  <text start="1065.28" dur="5.16">behind the scenes where they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1067.289" dur="6.061">kept from the corporate media and one of</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="6.42">these things is about Raqqa now this is</text>
  <text start="1073.35" dur="6.62">coming from individuals within Syria</text>
  <text start="1076.86" dur="9.17">where they&amp;#39;re saying that there&amp;#39;s a plan</text>
  <text start="1079.97" dur="10.41">behind the scenes that once rohnke is</text>
  <text start="1086.03" dur="8.769">completely free of the Islamic state the</text>
  <text start="1090.38" dur="10.029">master plan here is to hand Raqqa back</text>
  <text start="1094.799" dur="7.801">to Syria now remember the u.s. deep</text>
  <text start="1100.409" dur="6.121">States master plan their master plan is</text>
  <text start="1102.6" dur="6.18">a federalized partition of Syria but it</text>
  <text start="1106.53" dur="4.74">looks like the Syrian army Russia and</text>
  <text start="1108.78" dur="4.68">the United States they have different</text>
  <text start="1111.27" dur="4.35">plans than what the deep state is</text>
  <text start="1113.46" dur="3.77">planning right now and the agreement is</text>
  <text start="1115.62" dur="4.52">on Raqqa</text>
  <text start="1117.23" dur="6.84">and it looks like that they might hand</text>
  <text start="1120.14" dur="8.88">this back to Syria restore it to Syria</text>
  <text start="1124.07" dur="6.45">and if the Kurds want to have a part you</text>
  <text start="1129.02" dur="4.02">know if they want to separate themselves</text>
  <text start="1130.52" dur="5.64">from Syria it&amp;#39;s going to have to be a</text>
  <text start="1133.04" dur="5.759">vote by the people not by the deep state</text>
  <text start="1136.16" dur="4.56">not by the coalition forces and this is</text>
  <text start="1138.799" dur="5.341">what Russia has been saying for quite a</text>
  <text start="1140.72" dur="7.4">while and right now Russia and Assad</text>
  <text start="1144.14" dur="6.72">they hold all the cards in Syria the</text>
  <text start="1148.12" dur="6.4">paid mercenaries the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1150.86" dur="5.309">they are being squeezed there are pretty</text>
  <text start="1154.52" dur="4.409">much almost done for they have blocked</text>
  <text start="1156.169" dur="5.64">all the borders and the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="1158.929" dur="5.571">forces the terrorists they can&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="1161.809" dur="6.211">supplies in right now and we can see as</text>
  <text start="1164.5" dur="5.89">Russia and Syria move to different areas</text>
  <text start="1168.02" dur="4.89">and they set it up as a safe zone at the</text>
  <text start="1170.39" dur="5.61">escalation zone they bring in the</text>
  <text start="1172.91" dur="7.28">military police and they pretty much cut</text>
  <text start="1176" dur="8.19">this entire area off and right now</text>
  <text start="1180.19" dur="6.82">Russia has helped a lot they laid the</text>
  <text start="1184.19" dur="5.7">groundwork for a ceasefire they have the</text>
  <text start="1187.01" dur="5.52">most power right now the people of Syria</text>
  <text start="1189.89" dur="4.38">they are seeing this they&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="1192.53" dur="4.32">it as the United States has done this</text>
  <text start="1194.27" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re seeing it as Russia has helped</text>
  <text start="1196.85" dur="5.79">the country and this is a really big</text>
  <text start="1199.46" dur="5.88">deal and again when the people look at</text>
  <text start="1202.64" dur="5.25">Assad right now he invited Russia in</text>
  <text start="1205.34" dur="4.23">there so if there is any type of vote of</text>
  <text start="1207.89" dur="4.05">who do you want to be President</text>
  <text start="1209.57" dur="4.65">if you want the Kurds to have their own</text>
  <text start="1211.94" dur="4.65">land I think this is going to be shot</text>
  <text start="1214.22" dur="5.85">down and I think Russia knows that I</text>
  <text start="1216.59" dur="5.25">think Assad knows that and I think the</text>
  <text start="1220.07" dur="4.47">deep state knows that and this is why</text>
  <text start="1221.84" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t want to have any type of vote</text>
  <text start="1224.54" dur="3.3">they don&amp;#39;t want to have a referendum</text>
  <text start="1226.07" dur="3.599">because if that you leave it up to the</text>
  <text start="1227.84" dur="6.18">people it&amp;#39;s not going to be what they</text>
  <text start="1229.669" dur="7.38">want so basically right now the deep</text>
  <text start="1234.02" dur="6.33">state they are completely backed against</text>
  <text start="1237.049" dur="5.281">the wall right now and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1240.35" dur="4.829">looking at is what is happening out in</text>
  <text start="1242.33" dur="5.31">North Korea and I believe that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1245.179" dur="4.171">going to try to do something in the next</text>
  <text start="1247.64" dur="2.94">actually I think it&amp;#39;s the next couple of</text>
  <text start="1249.35" dur="3.51">weeks right now</text>
  <text start="1250.58" dur="5.79">because we see there&amp;#39;s a plan behind the</text>
  <text start="1252.86" dur="6.54">plan out in Syria and they are done for</text>
  <text start="1256.37" dur="5.31">their North Korea Russia and China they</text>
  <text start="1259.4" dur="5.55">are blocking the deep state at every</text>
  <text start="1261.68" dur="5.58">access point and they are becoming very</text>
  <text start="1264.95" dur="4.2">desperate and that&amp;#39;s why in the next</text>
  <text start="1267.26" dur="3.87">couple of weeks we need to watch the</text>
  <text start="1269.15" dur="4.05">situation very very carefully we</text>
  <text start="1271.13" dur="5.19">remember Congress is on break until</text>
  <text start="1273.2" dur="5.58">after Labor Day the deep state likes to</text>
  <text start="1276.32" dur="5.43">play in this timeframe and here we are</text>
  <text start="1278.78" dur="5.19">in August and it&amp;#39;s the 8th of August and</text>
  <text start="1281.75" dur="3.99">we can see they have all this time and I</text>
  <text start="1283.97" dur="3.69">think they were trying to set up some</text>
  <text start="1285.74" dur="5.4">type of false flag they were trying to</text>
  <text start="1287.66" dur="4.2">push their agenda and it was completely</text>
  <text start="1291.14" dur="3.03">blocked</text>
  <text start="1291.86" dur="5.22">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch because</text>
  <text start="1294.17" dur="3.78">they never give up if that plan goes</text>
  <text start="1297.08" dur="2.22">down the tubes</text>
  <text start="1297.95" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ll come up with another plan</text>
  <text start="1299.3" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re always goal oriented and</text>
  <text start="1301.7" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re pushing for they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1303.83" dur="6.54">pushing to get the United States the</text>
  <text start="1306.65" dur="5.37">world into a war and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
