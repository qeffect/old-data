  <text start="88.21" dur="5.1">that there&amp;#39;s two economies occurring at</text>
  <text start="91.18" dur="4.71">the same time and we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="93.31" dur="3.059">the central bank economy for a very long</text>
  <text start="95.89" dur="2.909">time</text>
  <text start="96.369" dur="4.381">then Trump came on the scene and he</text>
  <text start="98.799" dur="3.18">started to reverse everything the</text>
  <text start="100.75" dur="3.72">central bank the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="101.979" dur="6.451">doing gotten rid of the globalist trade</text>

  <text start="112.15" dur="5.37">world we know from cue there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="115.39" dur="4.769">be a restructuring of the Fed and we</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="5.029">know going back in time that Trump well</text>
  <text start="120.159" dur="5.85">he always contradicted the Fed he always</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="7.301">lashed out at the Fed and he believes in</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="6.691">gold and something very strange is</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="6.419">happening with the $100 bill and if we</text>
  <text start="132.7" dur="7.759">go back in time we know that the $100</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="7.981">bill well it changed one side of it is</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="6.961">the Federal Reserve the other side of it</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="5.91">is in gold it has the Constitution and</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="4.33">it&amp;#39;s the United States Treasury and</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="3.359">we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="4.019">a little bit and how all of this is</text>
  <text start="153.519" dur="4.651">going to come full circle but when we</text>
  <text start="155.769" dur="5.131">look at the economy today we can see the</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="4.52">economy is completely deteriorating and</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="3.14">imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="3.749">now we</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="4.529">tracking this for a very long time Trump</text>
  <text start="166.439" dur="3.121">right now just can&amp;#39;t take this economy</text>
  <text start="168.569" dur="2.131">and say okay you know what</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="3.75">let me just throw this switch</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="6.69">everything&amp;#39;s back to normal why because</text>
  <text start="173.31" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re in a central bank economy he needs</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="5.34">to back us out of this completely and</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="5.729">reset the entire thing just like he does</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="5.58">with his business businesses he declares</text>
  <text start="185.159" dur="4.771">bankruptcy he resets everything but when</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="3.06">we look at the central bank economy and</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="3.059">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the statistics</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="4.5">forget the statistics I&amp;#39;m not talk about</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="4.261">GDP the stock market unemployment those</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="2.91">are all manipulated to make you believe</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="3.72">the economy&amp;#39;s doing really really well</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="4.109">until the central bank brought the</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="5.31">economy down so no one was the wiser</text>
  <text start="202.889" dur="6.151">Trump is just using this and using their</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="6.48">weapons against them but when we look at</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="7.83">real data real information we can see</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="6.599">that different sectors within the</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="6.839">central bank economy it is falling apart</text>
  <text start="219.359" dur="7.321">at the same time Trump is bringing back</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="5.821">manufacturing and working out many many</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.519">deals he needs to do this this has to be</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="7.049">done the economy needs to be prepared</text>
  <text start="232.199" dur="7.41">for what is coming to get us back to</text>
  <text start="236.579" dur="4.291">where America once was when we look at</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="3.3">the housing market when we look at</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.679">construction we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="4.771">slowing very very quickly you as</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="4.881">construction spending well that posted</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="5.85">the smallest annual increase since 2011</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="5.44">for December spending declined by 0.6</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="4.739">percent from the prior month and when we</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="4.429">look at other sectors of the central</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="5.58">bank economy virtually every piece of</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="7.061">their economy is slowing down and</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="8.13">falling apart this is why the IMF the</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="7.65">Fed the biz they&amp;#39;re so worried they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.979" dur="5.19">in a panic they are completely exposed</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="5.58">right now think about what has been</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="5.28">happening here farm loan delinquencies</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="4.22">they just hit the highest level that</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="5.611">we&amp;#39;ve seen in nine years</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="6.24">JCPenney Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret pay less Gap</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="7.68">all those stores they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="6.37">hundreds of stores PepsiCo has started</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="5.33">laying off workers and is committed to</text>
  <text start="297.42" dur="6.09">millions of dollars in severance pay</text>
  <text start="301.07" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;ve just witnessed the largest decline</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="5.22">in the Philly Fed Business Index in more</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="6">than seven years January the sales of</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="4.89">existing homes fell by 0.8 point nine</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="4.02">percent this was the third month in a</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="3.5">row that we&amp;#39;ve seen a decline of at</text>
  <text start="315.42" dur="4.32">least 8 percent</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="5.68">US housing starts were down 11 point 2</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="5.58">percent in December home sales in</text>

  <text start="325.32" dur="4.14">point five percent more than one hundred</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="3.41">and sixty six billion dollars in student</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.44">loan debt is now seriously delinquent</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="4.75">more than seven million Americans are</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="4.68">behind in their auto loan payments this</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="4.05">is also a new all-time record and it is</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="5.22">far higher than anything we&amp;#39;ve witnessed</text>
  <text start="340.17" dur="6.06">during the last recession so when you</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="5.46">look at all of that you can see the</text>
  <text start="346.23" dur="5.43">central bank economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="3.63">very very rapidly and we know this has</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="3.3">nothing to do with Trump this is why</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking all this so the</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="3.42">mainstream media and all these financial</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="3.27">planners can&amp;#39;t come out and say hey you</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="3.36">know what had just happened Trump just</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="2.55">came into office and the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="3.48">falling apart</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="5.13">no the economy was always falling apart</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s built on an illusion the stock</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="6.42">market is manipulated GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="6.54">manipulated unemployment is manipulated</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s always been manipulated Trump has</text>
  <text start="377.67" dur="5.04">taken the manipulation to the hundredth</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="5.16">degree to use the central bank of the</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.81">deep state weapons against them now we</text>
  <text start="385.17" dur="6.03">know that Q has been telling us that</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="4.9">gold is going to be bring bringing down</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="4.56">the Fed now when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="393.42" dur="3.42">bank economy it is hurting right now and</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s around Europe throughout Asia but I</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="7.56">do believe China Russia and the United</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="7.64">States they are working on a plan to get</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="8.6">rid of the Federal Reserve to get rid of</text>
  <text start="412.04" dur="10.17">the Fed dollar now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="8.86">the $100 bill was newly created and</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="5.38">going back when Obama was president the</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="6.87">$100 bill</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="7.98">had one side where it said the Federal</text>
  <text start="432.54" dur="5.61">Reserve Note it was Green it had</text>
  <text start="435.57" dur="5.61">Franklin on it it was signed by the</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="5.85">Secretary of Treasury and the Treasury</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="6.45">of the United States so the left side</text>
  <text start="444" dur="5.82">what was a Federal Reserve Note and</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="5.39">there is even a stamp on it that says</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="6.51">United States Federal Reserve System</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="5.86">then there&amp;#39;s a thick blue line and I</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="5.79">know this is a security feature of the</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="6.09">$100 bill but it divides the bill almost</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="5.76">in half now on the other side of the</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="7.25">$100 bill it says the United States of</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="8.16">America and if you notice it doesn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="6.7">Federal Federal Reserve Note actually</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="6.24">the stamp there over the 100 is the</text>
  <text start="478.92" dur="9.06">United States Treasury and if you notice</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="8.34">it says July 4th 1776 and it has part of</text>
  <text start="487.98" dur="6.09">the Constitution they even has a Liberty</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="6.33">Bell and an inkwell that is in gold this</text>
  <text start="494.07" dur="6.18">and a feather which is a writing utensil</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="7.11">back then this side of the bill is all</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="7.44">gold and the left side is green and it</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="6.57">is a debt note so these two are separate</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="5.42">and what many people do believe is that</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="5.96">once we go back to the gold standard</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="8.8">you&amp;#39;ll be able to take part of this and</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="8.95">use it to get gold now think about this</text>
  <text start="521.91" dur="7.35">for a second this came out before Trump</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="6.18">was in office and we know that there is</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="3.87">bad guys good guys in the Federal</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="3.42">Reserve we know there&amp;#39;s bad guys good</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="5.19">guys in government and we know since</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="5.67">Trump came into office we see that the</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="7.16">good guys are fighting against the bad</text>
  <text start="540.81" dur="9.18">guys and during Obama&amp;#39;s administration</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="5.98">there was a huge push to get rid of cash</text>
  <text start="549.99" dur="6">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that this</text>
  <text start="551.46" dur="6.78">bill came out during the time where</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="4.05">there was this huge push to get rid of</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="2.73">cash because they wanted us to go</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="2.909">completely alike</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="6.109">chronic under the Central Bank system</text>
  <text start="562.949" dur="7.56">that was going to be the next system so</text>
  <text start="567.079" dur="5.971">what we&amp;#39;re seeing since that time period</text>
  <text start="570.509" dur="6.091">is that there&amp;#39;s been a surge in</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="9.19">countries and individuals and the</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="8.58">circulation of $100 bills now let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="4.8">go back for one sec here Lawrence</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="3.149">Summers former treasurer&amp;#39;s Treasury</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="3.149">secretary and director of National</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="6.031">Economic Council in the White House has</text>
  <text start="590.189" dur="7.111">argued for abolishing the $100 bill even</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="3.81">wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="4.099">2016</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="6.45">titled it&amp;#39;s time to kill the $100 bill</text>
  <text start="601.399" dur="5.851">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="5.94">amount of $100 bills in circulation is</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="5.889">surging and it&amp;#39;s leaving some economists</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="6.209">scratching their heads the number of</text>
  <text start="613.139" dur="5.851">outstanding US $100 bills has doubled</text>
  <text start="616.769" dur="5.99">since the financial crisis with more</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="6.99">than 12 billion of them across the world</text>
  <text start="622.759" dur="6.58">now this is very interesting because we</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="7.26">know from cue we know that gold is going</text>
  <text start="629.339" dur="6.81">to bring down the Fed what better way</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="6.75">than to prepare the nation and other</text>
  <text start="636.149" dur="7.531">countries than to put this type of bill</text>
  <text start="639.99" dur="8.73">out there and if you&amp;#39;re holding this</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="8.31">type of bill part of it is gold now is</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="7.14">it $100 worth of gold maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="651.99" dur="8.389">we don&amp;#39;t know but we can see that this</text>
  <text start="655.86" dur="10.44">was designed specifically for a specific</text>
  <text start="660.379" dur="8.89">time in our country now we know that Q</text>
  <text start="666.3" dur="6.029">has been giving us some hints about the</text>
  <text start="669.269" dur="6.271">Roth trial central bank system around</text>
  <text start="672.329" dur="6">the world we know that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="675.54" dur="5.07">be used one way or another is it going</text>
  <text start="678.329" dur="4.171">to be physical is it going to be the end</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="3.69">of the manipulation in the precious</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="4.199">metals market I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="684.3" dur="5.31">little bit of both because once you see</text>
  <text start="686.699" dur="4.83">gold start to rise and it continually</text>
  <text start="689.61" dur="5.159">creeps up yes we&amp;#39;re gonna see it Bob up</text>
  <text start="691.529" dur="6.93">and down but even if it goes from 1350</text>
  <text start="694.769" dur="6.75">down to 1280 then back up to 1375 then</text>
  <text start="698.459" dur="5.701">back down to 1325 and back up to 1400</text>
  <text start="701.519" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s inching its way up and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="704.16" dur="5.099">interesting about this is that that</text>
  <text start="706.079" dur="4.62">means the manipulation is coming to an</text>
  <text start="709.259" dur="3.93">end now I don&amp;#39;t believe they can do this</text>
  <text start="710.699" dur="4.591">very very quickly I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="713.189" dur="4.231">have to be a very slow process if they</text>
  <text start="715.29" dur="5.88">just let Gould do what it should do</text>
  <text start="717.42" dur="6.539">right now it would implode the entire</text>
  <text start="721.17" dur="5.31">system in a split second because all of</text>
  <text start="723.959" dur="4.53">a sudden Gould would rise 2,000 3,000</text>
  <text start="726.48" dur="3.81">4,000 and people would just rush into</text>
  <text start="728.489" dur="3.78">gold and then it would go up even higher</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="5.039">and this would be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="732.269" dur="6.57">disaster and I believe they have this</text>
  <text start="735.329" dur="8.19">plan and it started way back when they</text>
  <text start="738.839" dur="6.331">first created this $100 bill and I</text>
  <text start="743.519" dur="4.771">believe that this is going to be used</text>
  <text start="745.17" dur="5.37">later on and we were all confused back</text>
  <text start="748.29" dur="4.859">then why don&amp;#39;t we they create this when</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="4.169">the central bank was looking to get rid</text>
  <text start="753.149" dur="4.65">of $100 bills to get rid of cash</text>
  <text start="754.709" dur="5.22">completely actually Europe was looking</text>
  <text start="757.799" dur="4.35">to get rid of cash completely they</text>
  <text start="759.929" dur="6.051">wanted to go completely electronic where</text>
  <text start="762.149" dur="6.391">the central bank can control every thing</text>
  <text start="765.98" dur="4.149">this way if nobody had any cash guess</text>
  <text start="768.54" dur="4.829">what you couldn&amp;#39;t take any cash out of</text>
  <text start="770.129" dur="6">the bank but it looks like everything is</text>
  <text start="773.369" dur="5.91">being reversed everything that was</text>
  <text start="776.129" dur="6">created back then is going to be used to</text>
  <text start="779.279" dur="5.43">prepare us to enter the new economic</text>
  <text start="782.129" dur="5.52">system and that is going to be a gold</text>
  <text start="784.709" dur="6.81">back or cold confidence-building system</text>
  <text start="787.649" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s where this is all headed and we</text>
  <text start="791.519" dur="3.98">know that the private was the central</text>
  <text start="792.809" dur="6.21">bank their system and we&amp;#39;re watching it</text>
  <text start="795.499" dur="5.44">implode on itself it is imploding and as</text>
  <text start="799.019" dur="3.18">soon as it gets so bad and I believe</text>
  <text start="800.939" dur="3.21">that Trump is going to wait after the</text>
  <text start="802.199" dur="4.38">2020 election after he wins the election</text>
  <text start="804.149" dur="4.41">and that&amp;#39;s when he&amp;#39;s going to start the</text>
  <text start="806.579" dur="4.86">push to get rid of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="808.559" dur="6.36">have it audited and start to introduce</text>
  <text start="811.439" dur="6.06">the plan to transition us from the</text>
  <text start="814.919" dur="4.621">central bank economy into the new</text>
  <text start="817.499" dur="3.39">economy that they&amp;#39;ve been working on and</text>
  <text start="819.54" dur="3.149">this transition it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="820.889" dur="3">little bumpy it&amp;#39;s going to be a little</text>
  <text start="822.689" dur="3.06">difficult for many people especially</text>
  <text start="823.889" dur="3.921">those people that are sleeping they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="825.749" dur="3.83">going to be completely</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="4.709">surprised they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="829.579" dur="5.851">understand what is going on and it will</text>
  <text start="832.519" dur="4.86">be explained to them but once again they</text>
  <text start="835.43" dur="4.769">had no clue that this was happening they</text>
  <text start="837.379" dur="4.62">thought everything was fantastic but I</text>
  <text start="840.199" dur="4.11">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen is once</text>
  <text start="841.999" dur="4.051">Trump wins the election this is when the</text>
  <text start="844.309" dur="3.601">economy starts to fall apart this is</text>
  <text start="846.05" dur="4.469">when he turns around and says listen the</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="5.489">Fed is raising rates again the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.519" dur="4.92">falling apart it is their fault and we</text>
  <text start="853.399" dur="4.35">have the economy going perfectly well it</text>
  <text start="855.439" dur="4.38">was strong it was fantastic and at this</text>
  <text start="857.749" dur="4.95">time Trump and the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="859.819" dur="4.921">better control over the entire system</text>
  <text start="862.699" dur="3.661">because already during this period of</text>
  <text start="864.74" dur="3.81">time I believe we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="866.36" dur="4.44">arrests already I believe a lot of</text>
  <text start="868.55" dur="4.8">people will be on trial the mainstream</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="4.349">media well they&amp;#39;re gonna be floundering</text>
  <text start="873.35" dur="3.779">trying to figure out how to survive</text>
  <text start="875.149" dur="5.25">because many people are going to be</text>
  <text start="877.129" dur="5.041">looking at them as fake news and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.399" dur="4.23">gonna be pointing the finger at the Fed</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="5.609">because they&amp;#39;re going to believe him at</text>
  <text start="884.629" dur="5.221">this time think about the optics of all</text>
