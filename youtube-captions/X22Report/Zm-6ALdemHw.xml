  <text start="251.37" dur="6.09">world we are headed into a recession</text>

  <text start="297.6" dur="7.61">in sight it doesn&amp;#39;t this sound familiar</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="7.21">doesn&amp;#39;t this sound just like the Fed</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="7.87">think about it for a second he was on</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="6.69">Bloomberg TV and he was talking about</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="6">what has been going on and he was saying</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="4.35">there is no recession in sight we heard</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="4.25">this before</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="6.36">we heard it back during Bernanke&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="330.2" dur="8.91">what is Trump doing he&amp;#39;s convincing</text>
  <text start="335.73" dur="6.63">everyone that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="6.43">fantastically the mainstream media on</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="6.54">the other hand is trying to show how bad</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="6.45">the economy is they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="6.9">out a way to blame this on Trump and</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re using fear to do this now we</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="2.91">look at the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.99">yesterday we know how that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="4.86">completely manipulated and car sales</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.5">have been dropping we look at GM US</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="4.56">sales they&amp;#39;ve been dropping we look at</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="6.12">Ford US sales they&amp;#39;ve been dropping we</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="5.69">look at other automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="371.64" dur="6.24">like Toyota they&amp;#39;ve been falling</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="7.68">Mercedes falling BMW falling or I should</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="7.11">say declining they&amp;#39;re all declining why</text>
  <text start="381.5" dur="6.7">why is everything declining why is the</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="6.54">housing market in a gigantic bubble this</text>
  <text start="388.2" dur="6.66">was all one gigantic illusion now Trump</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="5.91">is controlling the narrative he has the</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="4.49">magic wand he can control everything the</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="5.94">mainstream media on the other hand is</text>
  <text start="399.35" dur="6.7">using fear that the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="4.05">fall apart now yes the economy is going</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="3.54">to fall apart Trump knows this the</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="4.38">Patriots know this but the point of this</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="4.77">is that they need to control the</text>
  <text start="411.81" dur="7.05">narrative so when the system does come</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="7.8">down the right group or groups are to</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="5.16">blame that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="5.819">right now now boards of war tweeted out</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="6.87">a thread think logically the greatest</text>
  <text start="427.979" dur="3.631">emotional trigger for fear is financial</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="2.88">collapse</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="4.559">most people know and feel that things</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="5.25">aren&amp;#39;t adding up change is coming</text>
  <text start="436.169" dur="4.801">economic change ready for another rabbit</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="4.08">hole here we go and then he explains</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="7.289">what he believes is happening right now</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="7.349">but yes the financial collapse is one of</text>
  <text start="448.259" dur="5.731">the biggest thing biggest things that</text>
  <text start="450.449" dur="6.421">wakes people up why because it hits</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.83">their wallets it hits their bank account</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="4.59">it hits everything that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="5.159">working for and when people hear</text>
  <text start="461.46" dur="5.4">recession or depression or financial</text>
  <text start="463.979" dur="5.461">collapse they start to get worried they</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="5.25">start to get scared now</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="5.27">the whole point of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="6.089">is to scare the people and to make them</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.63">try to think that it&amp;#39;s Trump who&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="478.199" dur="5.491">it but they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="6.63">time convincing the public because Trump</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="6.21">has been using their manipulation</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="7.979">methods to put out the word that jobs</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="7.28">are great GDP is great stock market is</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="5.071">great and this is being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="3.76">because eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="6.179">happen he&amp;#39;s going to be pointing the</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="5.759">finger at the Fed and another group</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="2.46">which he mentioned today which we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="506.699" dur="2.611">into in just a minute</text>
  <text start="507.659" dur="6">but I just want to mention something</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="7.849">very very positive today Tom</text>
  <text start="513.659" dur="6.661">representative Thomas Massie he</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="7.421">reintroduced his bipartisan bill to</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="6.51">audit the Federal Reserve it&amp;#39;s official</text>
  <text start="524.58" dur="4.259">now is it gonna move anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="526.83" dur="4.52">house is it gonna end up in the Senate</text>
  <text start="528.839" dur="7.261">and Trump&amp;#39;s gonna sign it not right now</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="8.77">but remember timing is everything where</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="7.71">would this bill be it will be in the</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="6.24">house waiting for that event</text>
  <text start="543.81" dur="4.68">think about the deep state think about</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="4.59">what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past they</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="4.89">introduced bills they get everything</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="6">prepared and then they have the event</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="6.39">now the event I&amp;#39;m talking about it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="6.329">to hurt the American people it&amp;#39;s to help</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="5.94">the American people it&amp;#39;s to destroy the</text>
  <text start="563.279" dur="6.901">central bank destroy the</text>
  <text start="565.71" dur="5.97">stay and get the people looking in the</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="4.469">right direction that&amp;#39;s what this is all</text>
  <text start="571.68" dur="5.52">about this is not about a 4-year</text>
  <text start="574.649" dur="4.651">president term this is not about oh</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="7.16">let&amp;#39;s just arrest these people and then</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="9.9">be done with it this is about changing</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="7.24">everything that we know about everything</text>
  <text start="589.2" dur="4.38">that we&amp;#39;ve been taught since the very</text>
  <text start="591.6" dur="6.359">very beginning when the central bank</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="7.08">came in this is about undoing all of</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="5.371">this and he just can&amp;#39;t come out and say</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;m just gonna sign this executive order</text>
  <text start="603.33" dur="3.69">or this bill and we&amp;#39;re gonna get rid of</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="3.96">the Fed because a lot of people wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="3.689">understand that now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="609.51" dur="5.37">interesting and I still believe that</text>
  <text start="610.709" dur="5.971">Powell is still working with Trump now</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="4.59">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="616.68" dur="5.79">said that he would not resign if Trump</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="6.51">were to ask him to do I think Trump is</text>
  <text start="622.47" dur="6.2">going to ask him to resign no is he</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="7.62">gonna continually criticize Powell yes</text>
  <text start="628.67" dur="9.55">but look what happened Powell says okay</text>
  <text start="633.6" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s flexible on interest rates he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="5.07">look at the economy he&amp;#39;ll see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.2" dur="6.12">happening and he calmed down all the</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="4.919">other Fed presidents because we know</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="3.69">that Kaplan and many others were out</text>
  <text start="648.209" dur="3.151">there saying we need to stop the</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="3.18">interest rates we need to stop this</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="4.38">because people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="653.19" dur="5.16">that it is us that is causing the</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="4.469">problems in the economy so we need to</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="5.4">stop that so Jerome Powell came out and</text>
  <text start="660.209" dur="6.121">said listen we&amp;#39;re going to take a look</text>
  <text start="663.75" dur="4.38">and be very flus flexible on the</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="4.59">interest rates now what does this really</text>
  <text start="668.13" dur="5.31">mean will he raise the rates or won&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="4.44">raise the rates I do believe that</text>
  <text start="673.44" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna continue to do it do I</text>
  <text start="675.36" dur="4.14">think they need to go that much further</text>
  <text start="677.07" dur="7.38">no I think this economy is built on such</text>
  <text start="679.5" dur="8.04">a big illusion that this thing is like a</text>
  <text start="684.45" dur="5.25">house of cards where it&amp;#39;s all ready to</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="3.84">come crashing down now can Trump with</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="3.03">the magic one make it look like we&amp;#39;re</text>
