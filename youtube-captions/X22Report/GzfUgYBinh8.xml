  <text start="75.79" dur="4.71">and more information that the economy is</text>
  <text start="78.01" dur="4.859">not doing well and we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="80.5" dur="4.14">the housing market and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="82.869" dur="4.921">realize that the housing market</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="5.16">well it&amp;#39;s slipping into the abyss here</text>
  <text start="87.79" dur="4.71">and remember the summer months this was</text>
  <text start="89.8" dur="4.59">the strong season for a housing this is</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="3.479">when it&amp;#39;s nice people like to move</text>
  <text start="94.39" dur="3.96">before school and here we are in</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="5.401">September and housing is really not</text>
  <text start="98.35" dur="4.92">going well at all and we&amp;#39;ve seen new</text>

  <text start="103.27" dur="5.519">sales all decline in July now in August</text>
  <text start="106.479" dur="5.131">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that existing home</text>
  <text start="108.789" dur="5.311">sales well they are not doing well now</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="3.869">back in July existing home sales dropped</text>
  <text start="114.1" dur="3.84">by one point three percent month on</text>
  <text start="115.479" dur="5.821">month now August saw the home sales</text>
  <text start="117.94" dur="6.959">tumble to 1.7 percent this is actually a</text>
  <text start="121.3" dur="5.61">lot worse than July and we can see at</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="5.7">this point that the housing market for</text>
  <text start="126.91" dur="6.78">three months in a row has been declining</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="6.181">during the hottest period for real</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="5.73">estate this tells us something is wrong</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="4.35">here something is not right and we can</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="3.63">see that people aren&amp;#39;t going out</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="5.16">purchasing homes now if we look at the</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="5.94">first-time buyers we see 31% of sales in</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="7.44">August came from first-time homebuyers</text>
  <text start="148.99" dur="7.89">which is down 33% in July and we can see</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="7.02">that this is not looking good now cash</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="8.579">sales were 20% of transactions in August</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="7.05">up from 19% in July but down from 22% a</text>
  <text start="165.459" dur="4.561">year ago so we can see the cash</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="4.38">purchases they&amp;#39;re not coming in like</text>
  <text start="170.02" dur="4.59">they used to remember China right now is</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="5.55">telling their investment houses to</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="5.129">invest in the one belt one road trade</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="3.72">system instead of sending their money</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="3.961">overseas and purchasing real estate</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="4.319">purchasing corporations purchasing</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="3.19">commercial real estate and we can see</text>
  <text start="185.769" dur="2.501">right now that this is</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="2.97">exactly what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of this more but a</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="5.04">lot more of this money dry up as we move</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="4.86">forward as the one belt one road system</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="5.37">comes online and more and more countries</text>
  <text start="197" dur="5.94">join and everything is set up we can see</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="5.04">that this is going to have a huge effect</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="5.64">here in the United States now we</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="4.77">understand that gold is manipulated and</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="4.23">we know there&amp;#39;s a couple individuals</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="6.18">within the banking system that got</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="5.79">caught manipulating silver and gold and</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="4.38">they were sending text messages back and</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="4.47">forth but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="5.16">that a German expert on the gold market</text>
  <text start="223.07" dur="5.25">Dmitri speck he came out and he said</text>
  <text start="225.8" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s been manipulation since 1993 now</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="5.28">according to him the manipulation of</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="4.35">gold prices has been presented by the</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="4.8">media as if it has been initiated by a</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="5.03">couple malicious traders just recently</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="4.68">but this is completely wrong he says and</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="4.57">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been saying you</text>
  <text start="243.08" dur="5.55">know UBS and many other banks are out</text>
  <text start="245.39" dur="4.89">there you know presenting these</text>
  <text start="248.63" dur="3.66">individuals saying that yes here is the</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="4.38">individual that manipulated it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="252.29" dur="3.9">over we squat them so everything is fine</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="3.99">and now precious metals are not</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="4.32">manipulate but the gold price</text>
  <text start="258.65" dur="5.519">manipulation he&amp;#39;s saying started on</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="6.08">August 5th 1993 these were central banks</text>
  <text start="264.169" dur="5.461">that initiated the process and namely</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="5.71">the head of the US central bank alan</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="7.02">greenspan is the one who pushed this</text>
  <text start="272.3" dur="7.14">forward now he&amp;#39;s saying that the US Fed</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.37">had arranged an agreement among central</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="5.43">banks to keep the gold price below $400</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="6.36">this was done for several years by means</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="5.22">of sales and loans drivers of gold price</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="3.39">manipulation central banks which often</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="4.38">belonged to the state do not act alone</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="5.22">but work closely with the bribe the</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="4.71">private banking system and financial</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="5.28">institutions now the manipulation</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.37">process is actually taking place today</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="4.29">it has not stopped just because they</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="3.96">showed a couple individuals you know</text>
  <text start="306.56" dur="5.13">manipulating some silver or some gold</text>
  <text start="308.51" dur="5.73">this isn&amp;#39;t the end of it and what</text>
  <text start="311.69" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re keeping all the</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="3.929">rival currencies and all the currencies</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="3.54">at a certain level</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="5.281">by controlling gold</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="4.41">and he&amp;#39;s saying that one of the main</text>
  <text start="323.45" dur="4.26">beneficiaries of the gold price</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="6.15">manipulation process is to keep the US</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.21">banking system afloat to keep it</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="5.28">operational and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="3.78">that from all the contracts that they</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="3.15">throw at gold all the contracts that</text>
  <text start="337.7" dur="3.24">they throw at silver we can see that</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="3">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to control the</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="3.18">precious metals market for a very long</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="3.45">time and you know precious metals move</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="3.89">up they throw more contracts at it bring</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="4.92">it back down and we can see at this time</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="5.23">they might be losing control because as</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="4.98">they throw more and more paper contracts</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="3.66">at gold and silver it&amp;#39;s not having the</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="4.41">same effect anymore</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="5.4">so things are definitely changing now we</text>
  <text start="360.17" dur="4.32">talk about the one belt one road system</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="5.07">quite a bit and how China they are</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="5.67">pushing the idea that this is where the</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="5.13">trading system for the entire world is</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="5.37">going to operate from and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="6.27">seeing right now is the United States</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="4.65">and the Western countries they are</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="2.82">becoming a little bit nervous about this</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.17">and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="5.16">bringing up the idea of sanctions on</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="4.14">China this is why they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="4.26">saying that for years China merely</text>
  <text start="388.49" dur="6.27">copied the Western technology stealing</text>
  <text start="391.01" dur="5.94">trade secrets and they use this for a</text>
  <text start="394.76" dur="5.58">very long time but China is really</text>
  <text start="396.95" dur="6.3">passing by what they&amp;#39;ve been saying and</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re moving into an area where</text>
  <text start="403.25" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not really stealing trade</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="4.59">secrets anymore now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="4.74">time in the three and a half decades</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="4.62">since Ronald Reagan became present by</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.68">the best measurement of economic</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="5.37">performance China has soared from 10</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="7.26">percent the size of the u.s. to 60</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="7.44">percent in 2007 100 percent in 2014 and</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="6.09">115 percent today if the current trend</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="5.67">continues China&amp;#39;s economy will be a full</text>
  <text start="430.85" dur="5.91">50 percent larger than that of the US by</text>
  <text start="433.31" dur="6.06">2023 by 2040 it could be nearly three</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="5.49">times as large that would mean a China</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="5.37">with a triple America&amp;#39;s resources to use</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="5.73">influencing outcomes in international</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="5.93">relations now we need to understand what</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="5.14">China is doing right now they are</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="7.37">building rail links</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="7.769">throughout Asia throughout Africa going</text>
  <text start="458.04" dur="4.77">to be throughout Europe and Chinese</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="5.401">companies will be able to pack</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="8.1">components into containers for assembly</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="6.54">by low-cost labor in other countries and</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;ll be able to do this through all</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="3.149">the rail lines that they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="3.66">and all their seaports that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="4.291">setting up and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="5.88">now is China is going to be transforming</text>
  <text start="480.27" dur="6.149">the economics all over the world and the</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="5.82">United States right now is very very</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="6.661">nervous about this and they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="6.15">how to stop this and China&amp;#39;s power and</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="5.61">their influence is going to grow over</text>
  <text start="495.78" dur="5.19">time it&amp;#39;s already growing at this point</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="4.32">because they&amp;#39;re not just dealing with</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.88">these different countries by using</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="5.129">sanctions and force and military they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.85" dur="3.64">dealing with all these countries saying</text>

  <text start="519.75" dur="4.229">funds we&amp;#39;re not gonna force something on</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="3.75">you we&amp;#39;re not going to take control of</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="4.921">your country we&amp;#39;re going to teach you</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="4.89">all of this so you can build your</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="4.62">country on your own and we can have</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="5.43">trade with you this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="6.509">right now now Russia is on board with</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="6.21">this many countries are joining in on</text>
  <text start="540.029" dur="4.321">the one belt one road system the United</text>
  <text start="542.52" dur="3.689">States at this point well we had a</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="4.31">representative go to the conference and</text>
  <text start="546.209" dur="5.82">I think the United States needs to join</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="5.59">we might be joining because if we are</text>
  <text start="552.029" dur="4.471">left out in the cold this is going to be</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="5.82">a huge huge problem for the United</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="5.339">States and the Chinese once everything</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="4.26">is set in the place they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="6.951">circumvent the Western embargoes the</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="8.91">sanctions whatever the US forces on the</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="8.71">Chinese people the government they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="7.469">care this is why we hear all these talks</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="5.4">about sanctions that we&amp;#39;re gonna you</text>
  <text start="580.709" dur="4.711">know shut down the trade system with</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="3.629">China and again all of this is not going</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="2.969">to hurt China it</text>
  <text start="586.529" dur="5.281">going to hurt the United States because</text>
  <text start="588.389" dur="5.88">the United States consumes right now 70%</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="6.18">of what the United States does is it</text>
  <text start="594.269" dur="6.271">consumes and if we stop and we place</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="4.68">sanctions on China guess what the store</text>
  <text start="600.54" dur="3.899">shelves are gonna go empty people are</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.2">going to have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="604.439" dur="5.31">getting supplies and things will</text>
  <text start="606.87" dur="5.49">actually completely fall apart this is</text>
  <text start="609.749" dur="5.46">how you know the Western world is</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="5.699">becoming very very afraid of what China</text>
  <text start="615.209" dur="5.221">is doing and their economy has grown</text>
  <text start="618.059" dur="4.351">very very big in a short period of time</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="4.349">now we&amp;#39;ve been following this for quite</text>
  <text start="622.41" dur="3.45">a while this is really nothing new we</text>
  <text start="624.779" dur="4.651">knew they were heading in this direction</text>
  <text start="625.86" dur="5.13">and here we are already in 2017 and we</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="4.44">can see that everything that we talked</text>
  <text start="630.99" dur="5.159">about is accelerating and China is</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="4.56">becoming a huge player Russia&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="636.149" dur="3.54">a huge player and the United States</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="3.599">right now because everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="639.689" dur="3.9">done because remember the globalists</text>
  <text start="642.029" dur="2.55">that were involved with the United</text>
  <text start="643.589" dur="3.54">States they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="644.579" dur="4.831">control the world with the TPP the TTIP</text>
  <text start="647.129" dur="4.65">and they thought they had everything and</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="3.75">they were gonna make all the countries</text>
  <text start="651.779" dur="3.81">the same and they were be able to trade</text>
  <text start="653.16" dur="4.38">and have manufacturing at any one of the</text>
  <text start="655.589" dur="4.29">countries because all the countries</text>
  <text start="657.54" dur="5.46">would be on an even playing field now</text>
  <text start="659.879" dur="5.88">since that has been halted and this</text>
