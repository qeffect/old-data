  <text start="208.109" dur="5.25">different there is an incredible amount</text>
  <text start="210.299" dur="5.041">of illusion going on here the Fed has</text>
  <text start="213.359" dur="4.231">created an illusion the government has</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="4.229">created an illusion and you look at the</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="5.509">stock market you know the stocks are</text>
  <text start="219.569" dur="6.151">going way way up if you look at the</text>
  <text start="223.099" dur="5.081">corporate media they are letting us know</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="5.219">that this holiday season was pretty darn</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="6.57">good I have some headlines here from</text>

  <text start="260.549" dur="3.691">are doing fantastic they had a great</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="3.541">holiday season and it it would make</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="3.06">sense because they have to keep the</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="3.51">illusion up because they brought the</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="2.52">unemployment down to seven percent and</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="2.58">we understand</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="5.34">more people are falling off unemployment</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="7.95">and we saw from the job data coming out</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="6.36">that less people are claiming that they</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="3.36">have no work so they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="3.75">dropping the unemployment rate probably</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="4.14">again and they have to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="3.69">up that things are going well and this</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="3.81">is why you see the headlines but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="4.17">cut through this and see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="4.29">going on well yesterday we learned that</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="5.25">Macy&amp;#39;s is closing five stores laying off</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="5.94">2,500 people now again correct me if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="7.32">wrong here if unemployment is going down</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="6.66">and it&amp;#39;s getting better and people have</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="5.34">work that means they have disposable</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="6.27">income wouldn&amp;#39;t retail sales be getting</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="5.76">better wouldn&amp;#39;t stores expand because I</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="5.76">correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong again I remember</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="5.34">prior to 2008 when things were when</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="4.68">unemployment was low stores were</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="5.21">expanding businesses were hiring like</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="6.9">crazy housing was selling like crazy</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="6.28">everything was moving along here we have</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="4.23">an illusion we have an illusion that</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="4.5">unemployment is coming down because they</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="4.23">manipulated the numbers but again we see</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="3.54">Macy&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="4.35">having problems and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.67" dur="4.05">reorganizing restructuring and this is</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="3.15">the term that they like to use and it</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="3.42">makes it seem like oh they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="3.95">on purpose but really no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="349.14" dur="6.33">really the reason so if we let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="6.22">specific stores now of actually what</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="3.57">their sales are like because you know</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="3.81">you look at the headlines and it seems</text>
  <text start="359.04" dur="3.57">like everything is perfect I can&amp;#39;t why</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="4.89">would you even say that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="6.38">problem but Barnes &amp;amp; Noble holiday sales</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="6.84">dropped by six point six percent sales</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="7.3">fell at its bookstores and online during</text>
  <text start="373.14" dur="6.63">the critical holiday season hmm that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="5.97">interesting hhgregg which is that this</text>

  <text start="385.92" dur="6.51">fell by eleven percent so things seem a</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="2.7">little different right now about how</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re telling us the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="4.28">and from the headlines that I just read</text>

  <text start="431.91" dur="4.92">year ago now if i remember correctly a</text>
  <text start="434.19" dur="4.65">year ago unemployment was worse it was</text>
  <text start="436.83" dur="5.1">around seven point eight percent during</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="4.74">the same time period now it&amp;#39;s seven</text>

  <text start="450.78" dur="4.59">correct me a row again if i&amp;#39;m wrong here</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="3.9">during the year of 2013 the unemployment</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="3.24">rate kept on coming down coming down</text>
  <text start="457.02" dur="3.57">coming down until we got to the holiday</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="3.54">season where was seven percent that</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="3.81">would mean things are getting better</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="4.56">that means things should be expanding</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="5.1">that means stores should be expanding</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="6.9">because more people have income but what</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="8.51">do we see we see store closings 432</text>

  <text start="514.32" dur="6.12">more people have employment they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.959" dur="7.44">telling us that things are okay if this</text>

  <text start="527.339" dur="4.561">corporate media and the government have</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="6.511">to spin it that everything is getting</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="5.52">better and this is the illusion that i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="4.5">talking about they want every</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="4.11">when looking at the stock market and if</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="3.93">you go out and you tell people that</text>
  <text start="541.53" dur="4.32">things are bad all they remember seeing</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="5.76">are the headlines that I read to you</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="6.48">sales in December up sales in December</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;ve done a lot better foot traffic a</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="4.14">little bit lower but sales are great and</text>
  <text start="554.28" dur="6">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="6.45">everyone that the recovery is here and</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s happening and it goes with the same</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="5.7">thing with housing they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="565.14" dur="7.29">same exact thing there is absolutely no</text>
  <text start="568.62" dur="8.33">difference how can mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="9.81">be plunging at sixty-six percent and</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="9.19">housing being in a recovery it makes no</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="5.91">sense sales are declining yes they have</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="3.99">given money to hedge funds and investors</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="3.99">to pump up the market and they are</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="4.14">paying these houses in cash because</text>
  <text start="592.14" dur="5.19">sixty percent of the sales are in cash</text>
  <text start="594.27" dur="6.51">and this is why we see housing prices</text>
  <text start="597.33" dur="6.68">move up just because housing prices are</text>
  <text start="600.78" dur="7.65">moving up doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is recovering</text>
  <text start="604.01" dur="8.47">I&amp;#39;ve seen housing prices move up in 2007</text>
  <text start="608.43" dur="5.79">and then what do we see in 2008 doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="3.66">mean things are getting better and if we</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="4.65">see that more and more people are</text>
  <text start="616.14" dur="4.59">getting out of the housing because they</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="4.02">can&amp;#39;t get into it because mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="620.73" dur="3.87">are going up and it&amp;#39;s kicking people out</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="4.13">even with a hundred percent financing</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="5.1">and this is why they&amp;#39;re introducing</text>
  <text start="627.02" dur="5.32">adjustable rate mortgages because they</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="5.25">need more people to get into the housing</text>
  <text start="632.34" dur="4.89">market to keep the bubble going and</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s what it is and it just won&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="637.23" dur="8.16">because we have to use common sense here</text>
  <text start="639.51" dur="8.28">because after the last 2008 crash there</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.74">is the foreclosures there&amp;#39;s the short</text>
  <text start="647.79" dur="5.64">selling and the people that have no</text>
  <text start="650.13" dur="9.45">credit left and don&amp;#39;t forget the Fed is</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="8.79">still purchasing all that toxic real</text>
  <text start="659.58" dur="5.16">estate from the banks and the banks are</text>
  <text start="662.22" dur="5.43">using that money to prop up the stock</text>

  <text start="1410.45" dur="5.64">overthrow the government and this is</text>
  <text start="1412.43" dur="7.98">what they do now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1416.09" dur="7.83">US wants Afghanistan the government in</text>
  <text start="1420.41" dur="6.45">Afghanistan to sign the security</text>
  <text start="1423.92" dur="5.19">document which will allow the US troops</text>
  <text start="1426.86" dur="4.35">to stay in Afghanistan and so far they</text>
  <text start="1429.11" dur="5.22">haven&amp;#39;t signed it because the Afghan</text>
  <text start="1431.21" dur="5.43">government doesn&amp;#39;t want to do it does</text>
  <text start="1434.33" dur="5.85">want to sign it because what they want</text>
  <text start="1436.64" dur="6.5">first is they want the u.s. to conduct</text>
  <text start="1440.18" dur="5.28">night raids under Afghan Authority and</text>
  <text start="1443.14" dur="4.6">Washington does not want to do this</text>
  <text start="1445.46" dur="4.53">because they are breaking every single</text>
  <text start="1447.74" dur="3.96">law known to mankind and especially all</text>
  <text start="1449.99" dur="4.41">the laws United States they are just</text>
  <text start="1451.7" dur="5.46">rating anyone&amp;#39;s house going in there</text>
  <text start="1454.4" dur="5.16">killing people without provocation or</text>
  <text start="1457.16" dur="3.78">the right to do so and the Afghan</text>
  <text start="1459.56" dur="3.84">government wants to put a stop to this</text>
  <text start="1460.94" dur="4.59">and they want to be in control of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1463.4" dur="4.44">going on but of course the US government</text>
  <text start="1465.53" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t want to work that way so right</text>
  <text start="1467.84" dur="5.13">now it hasn&amp;#39;t been signed</text>
  <text start="1469.91" dur="5.7">so a senior US commander in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1472.97" dur="5.19">says that Washington has no plans to</text>
  <text start="1475.61" dur="5.37">leave the country while Kabul has not</text>
  <text start="1478.16" dur="4.77">signed a security deal to allow us</text>
  <text start="1480.98" dur="4.89">tropes to stay in afghanistan beyond</text>
  <text start="1482.93" dur="4.38">2014 so they are not leaving and the</text>
  <text start="1485.87" dur="3.69">real reason why they&amp;#39;re not leaving is</text>
  <text start="1487.31" dur="4.2">because they have natural resources</text>
  <text start="1489.56" dur="3.96">China&amp;#39;s in there helping the Afghan</text>
  <text start="1491.51" dur="4.89">people with their infrastructure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1493.52" dur="7.35">mining copper in Afghanistan Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1496.4" dur="7.32">is also a that they&amp;#39;re growing poppy</text>
  <text start="1500.87" dur="7.32">fields to create OPM to pay for quote</text>
  <text start="1503.72" dur="5.91">covert operations for us operatives to</text>
  <text start="1508.19" dur="4.29">create right you know riots and protests</text>
  <text start="1509.63" dur="5.31">in the Ukraine same thing in Syria to</text>
  <text start="1512.48" dur="5.79">send weapons over there and to pay for</text>
  <text start="1514.94" dur="5.58">all the al-qaeda terrorists that are</text>
  <text start="1518.27" dur="4.32">running around throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="1520.52" dur="3.95">East and this is why they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1522.59" dur="4.65">lay all so it&amp;#39;s a completely fantastic</text>
  <text start="1524.47" dur="5.17">strategical location between the Russian</text>
  <text start="1527.24" dur="5.13">states and it borders right against Iran</text>
  <text start="1529.64" dur="6.57">and this is why they are actually never</text>
  <text start="1532.37" dur="5.34">going to leave that area now Libya the</text>
  <text start="1536.21" dur="4.32">government of Libya and we have to</text>
  <text start="1537.71" dur="5.1">remember it is a puppet government they</text>
  <text start="1540.53" dur="7.38">are saying that they will destroy any</text>
  <text start="1542.81" dur="7.58">tanker that pulls up and gets oil from</text>
  <text start="1547.91" dur="6.24">the rebels that have taken charge of</text>
  <text start="1550.39" dur="5.86">certain ports and again we have to think</text>
  <text start="1554.15" dur="4.56">why why would they do why would this you</text>
  <text start="1556.25" dur="6.15">know fire upon or destroy the tanker</text>
  <text start="1558.71" dur="7.38">well because the rebels are not selling</text>
  <text start="1562.4" dur="5.58">the oil using the US dollar and guess</text>
  <text start="1566.09" dur="3.9">what the central bankers do not make</text>
  <text start="1567.98" dur="4.89">money if they do this so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1569.99" dur="5.73">to destroy the tanker and not allow them</text>
  <text start="1572.87" dur="6.6">to sell the oil and this is why they are</text>
  <text start="1575.72" dur="5.79">doing this because again the people in</text>
  <text start="1579.47" dur="4.23">all of these countries are rising up</text>
  <text start="1581.51" dur="4.17">there pushing they want their countries</text>
  <text start="1583.7" dur="3.93">back they are pushing the private ones</text>
  <text start="1585.68" dur="4.11">central bankers out of the country which</text>
  <text start="1587.63" dur="5.01">is also the US government and the</text>
  <text start="1589.79" dur="5.43">central bankers always fight back very</text>
  <text start="1592.64" dur="5.28">dirty and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="1595.22" dur="4.97">getting worse as time goes on they are</text>
  <text start="1597.92" dur="4.14">definitely losing control and I thought</text>
  <text start="1600.19" dur="3.34">today there was a very interesting</text>
  <text start="1602.06" dur="3.48">article that al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1603.53" dur="3.84">controls more Terry more territory than</text>
  <text start="1605.54" dur="3">ever in the Middle East you have to</text>
  <text start="1607.37" dur="4.5">remember you have to separate in your</text>
  <text start="1608.54" dur="5.64">mind when they talk about al qaeda al</text>
  <text start="1611.87" dur="4.5">qaeda are the rebels are the people of</text>
  <text start="1614.18" dur="3.93">the country who want their country back</text>
  <text start="1616.37" dur="3.93">but of course the US government calls</text>
  <text start="1618.11" dur="3.99">them al qaeda and this is their calling</text>
  <text start="1620.3" dur="3.69">them all terrorists and this is why we</text>
  <text start="1622.1" dur="3.51">have to use drone attacks against these</text>
  <text start="1623.99" dur="4.95">people but they aren&amp;#39;t terrorists they</text>
  <text start="1625.61" dur="5.34">want their country back because the UN</text>
  <text start="1628.94" dur="4.29">the united states the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1630.95" dur="3.99">moved into these countries pushed out</text>
  <text start="1633.23" dur="3.87">the government and replace the</text>
  <text start="1634.94" dur="4.53">government with a puppet government to</text>
  <text start="1637.1" dur="5.58">sell their natural resources using the</text>
  <text start="1639.47" dur="6.12">US dollar and now why they are actually</text>
  <text start="1642.68" dur="6.5">saying is that the people the rebels of</text>
  <text start="1645.59" dur="6.42">the revolutionaries of the country are</text>
  <text start="1649.18" dur="5.5">taking over more and more towns and</text>
  <text start="1652.01" dur="4.89">cities and they&amp;#39;re taking more they have</text>
  <text start="1654.68" dur="4.53">more control of the territories at this</text>
  <text start="1656.9" dur="4.92">point and like I&amp;#39;ve been saying the</text>
  <text start="1659.21" dur="5.55">central bankers US government are losing</text>
  <text start="1661.82" dur="5">ground in the Middle East and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1664.76" dur="7.14">getting worse and worse and this is why</text>
  <text start="1666.82" dur="6.94">the president wants to send aid there</text>
  <text start="1671.9" dur="4.47">this is why he&amp;#39;s sending military</text>
  <text start="1673.76" dur="5.25">equipment this is why he&amp;#39;s sending</text>
  <text start="1676.37" dur="4.98">troops to train the soldiers of the</text>
  <text start="1679.01" dur="4.2">puppet governments and this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1681.35" dur="4.17">going to be very difficult to put troops</text>
  <text start="1683.21" dur="4.71">on the ground and this is why he only</text>
  <text start="1685.52" dur="5.64">can send drones in and have these drone</text>
  <text start="1687.92" dur="4.38">strikes and fire upon like weddings and</text>
  <text start="1691.16" dur="3.78">things like that and there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="1692.3" dur="5.07">problem in Yemen it&amp;#39;s a big problem in</text>
  <text start="1694.94" dur="4.41">Libya it&amp;#39;s a big problem in Lebanon it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1697.37" dur="4.32">a big problem in Iraq and it is</text>
  <text start="1699.35" dur="4.65">completely spreading throughout the</text>
  <text start="1701.69" dur="5.67">Middle East now the other al Qaeda that</text>
  <text start="1704" dur="5.16">they like to talk about also is the al</text>
  <text start="1707.36" dur="5.19">Qaeda that fights along the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1709.16" dur="5.76">rebels which is against Assad of the</text>
  <text start="1712.55" dur="4.53">President of Syria because the President</text>
  <text start="1714.92" dur="5.1">of Syria does not sell his natural</text>
  <text start="1717.08" dur="6.12">resources using the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="1720.02" dur="6.45">reserve currency so al Qaeda fighting</text>
  <text start="1723.2" dur="5.13">with the rebels are good al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="1726.47" dur="4.71">now they&amp;#39;re trying to separate the good</text>
  <text start="1728.33" dur="4.2">al Qaeda with the bad al Qaeda and this</text>
  <text start="1731.18" dur="3.99">is what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="1732.53" dur="4.77">because they got into a corner of</text>
  <text start="1735.17" dur="4.74">calling everyone al Qaeda and everyone</text>
  <text start="1737.3" dur="4.29">is getting confused of wait a minute I</text>
  <text start="1739.91" dur="3.39">thought we&amp;#39;re fighting al-qaeda why are</text>
  <text start="1741.59" dur="3.72">we fighting along out why are we</text>
  <text start="1743.3" dur="4.17">supporting al-qaeda and this is how all</text>
  <text start="1745.31" dur="4.23">the confusion started so they just</text>
  <text start="1747.47" dur="4.74">pretty much call everyone al Qaeda that</text>
  <text start="1749.54" dur="4.29">they need to bomb at this point and of</text>
  <text start="1752.21" dur="2.76">course they&amp;#39;re really not al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="1753.83" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re starting to change the name of</text>
  <text start="1754.97" dur="5.57">al Qaeda to my I think it&amp;#39;s Isis or</text>
  <text start="1757.97" dur="7.44">something the Islamic something or other</text>
  <text start="1760.54" dur="7.93">force and this is to separate what</text>
  <text start="1765.41" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re talking about here now there has</text>
  <text start="1768.47" dur="5.21">been a report that there have been two</text>
  <text start="1770.96" dur="5.46">attacks on the chemical arm sites in</text>
  <text start="1773.68" dur="6.46">Syria and I haven&amp;#39;t seen any other</text>
  <text start="1776.42" dur="5.64">information at all to see if any of the</text>
  <text start="1780.14" dur="4.44">chemical weapons are missing at this</text>
  <text start="1782.06" dur="5.16">point but there are continuous attacks</text>
  <text start="1784.58" dur="5.4">on the sites where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1787.22" dur="6.99">move all the chemical weapons out of the</text>
  <text start="1789.98" dur="6.9">country and again like I said the</text>
  <text start="1794.21" dur="6.02">economy of the United States is a</text>
  <text start="1796.88" dur="6.33">complete illusion and we understand that</text>
  <text start="1800.23" dur="4.69">eventually all illusions come to an end</text>
  <text start="1803.21" dur="5.73">because they cannot be supported anymore</text>
  <text start="1804.92" dur="7.37">and the time is getting close and they</text>
  <text start="1808.94" dur="6.66">are looking for different ways to cover</text>
  <text start="1812.29" dur="5.65">their butts basically and one way</text>
  <text start="1815.6" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re going to do it is by some type</text>
  <text start="1817.94" dur="5.43">of special event that will occur in this</text>
  <text start="1821.39" dur="4.62">country which will take all eyes off of</text>
  <text start="1823.37" dur="4.83">the Fed and the US government they will</text>
  <text start="1826.01" dur="4.29">blame it on another country they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1828.2" dur="3.39">building up the propaganda against think</text>
  <text start="1830.3" dur="3.36">about it which countries are building</text>
  <text start="1831.59" dur="6.99">the propaganda against its North Korea</text>
  <text start="1833.66" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s China it&amp;#39;s Syria it&amp;#39;s Russia and we</text>
  <text start="1838.58" dur="4.62">can see why they are doing this because</text>
  <text start="1841.04" dur="4.08">one of these come and I ran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1843.2" dur="3.9">still I mean now the Senators are</text>
  <text start="1845.12" dur="5.16">getting together I think there&amp;#39;s 50</text>
  <text start="1847.1" dur="5.79">senators now that have or 52 now that</text>
  <text start="1850.28" dur="5.13">have been put I&amp;#39;ve been voting for the</text>
  <text start="1852.89" dur="4.11">sanctions against Iran and we can see</text>
  <text start="1855.41" dur="6.36">this is all going to be blowing up in</text>
  <text start="1857" dur="7.41">their in their faces where it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1861.77" dur="4.95">leave probably the president with only</text>
  <text start="1864.41" dur="3.91">one outcome of this and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1866.72" dur="4.15">military strike on</text>
  <text start="1868.32" dur="4.89">ran and before that happens they have to</text>
  <text start="1870.87" dur="5.039">convince the American people that we</text>
  <text start="1873.21" dur="3.87">have the right to go in and put troops</text>
  <text start="1875.909" dur="4.35">on the ground because we have to</text>
  <text start="1877.08" dur="5.76">remember they are losing control in the</text>
  <text start="1880.259" dur="5.101">Middle East and at this point they</text>
  <text start="1882.84" dur="4.77">cannot put troops on the ground boots on</text>
  <text start="1885.36" dur="7.049">the ground they can&amp;#39;t do it because the</text>
  <text start="1887.61" dur="7.38">American people do not want war at all</text>
  <text start="1892.409" dur="4.65">ed has been proven when they tried the</text>
  <text start="1894.99" dur="4.83">false flag with Syria with the chemical</text>
  <text start="1897.059" dur="4.83">weapons Congress is not up for it the</text>
  <text start="1899.82" dur="5.64">American people are not up for it so the</text>
  <text start="1901.889" dur="6.691">only way to get troops into these</text>
  <text start="1905.46" dur="5.579">countries again is with some type of an</text>
  <text start="1908.58" dur="5.01">event just like they did with the World</text>
  <text start="1911.039" dur="5.13">Trade Center all of a sudden they said a</text>
