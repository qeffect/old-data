  <text start="120.03" dur="4.979">economy and a while back a couple</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="6.75">reports ago we talked about how China</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="7.291">was helping Trump stop this recession</text>

  <text start="156.08" dur="6.129">Trump the Patriots they need something</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="5.07">else they needed stimulus they needed</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="3.151">something to</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="3.54">prop up the entire system we have to</text>
  <text start="165.36" dur="5.1">remember the central bank&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="6.93">throughout 2008 to the present day</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve been using stimulus to keep the</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="4.11">system alive</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="3.93">pumping in currency into the system now</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="3.72">what does this do</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="5.25">it keeps these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="5.04">looking great they&amp;#39;re able to create</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="4.65">currency and have other central banks</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="5.01">buy stocks keep the stock market up</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re able to fund other central bank</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="6.32">systems and they&amp;#39;re able to make the</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="6.84">economy appear like it is doing</text>
  <text start="198.38" dur="5.14">fantastically but in reality it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="3.45">completely falling apart remember</text>
  <text start="203.52" dur="2.4">there&amp;#39;s a lot more to the economy than</text>
  <text start="204.96" dur="3.09">the stock market</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="4.71">on the manipulated unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="6">the manipulated GDP numbers and whatever</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="6.27">else they can manipulate because when</text>
  <text start="214.05" dur="5.82">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs when countries</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="5.82">cannot pay off their debt when countries</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="6">have to implement austerity when the</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="5.43">people are just angry at all these taxes</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="3.18">and more taxes being piled on I mean</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="6.87">think about it</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="10.38">New Jersey needed a rain tax to help the</text>
  <text start="235.02" dur="7.68">air economy a rain tax where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="5.73">going to tax people on the runoff of</text>
  <text start="242.7" dur="6.78">rainwater now we know this is part of</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="6.12">the global climate solution where</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re going to tax everyone actually</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re going to try to implement this</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="6.06">carbon footprint and they would tax you</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="4.98">on your carbon footprint now this was</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="3.6">not going to help the economy this was</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="4.5">going to help individuals become very</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="6.84">very wealthy and help the central</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="7.32">bankers keep the system alive longer to</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="6.27">pay off the debt go back in history for</text>
  <text start="273" dur="7.02">a second when you read about history</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="5.64">about kingdoms and governments taxing</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="3.81">the people and continually taxed them</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="5.01">and taxing them until the people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="6.26">give anymore is because their system was</text>
  <text start="287.04" dur="5.879">collapsing they didn&amp;#39;t have enough funds</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="4.78">today it&amp;#39;s the same thing when they</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="2.701">create more and more of these taxes and</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="2.019">they&amp;#39;re becoming more and more</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="3.16">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="5.671">you&amp;#39;re scratching head on wait a minute</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="6.509">this isn&amp;#39;t right that&amp;#39;s how you know</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="4.859">this system is breaking down because</text>
  <text start="305.289" dur="4.44">pretty soon they&amp;#39;re just well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="3.93">gonna tax the air that you breathe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.729" dur="3.421">gonna tax you if you look at the Sun</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re gonna tax you if you get hit by</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="6.15">rainwater because they don&amp;#39;t know other</text>
  <text start="316.689" dur="5.19">any other way on how to keep the system</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="7.589">alive and this is what they do they</text>
  <text start="321.879" dur="9.81">bleed everyone dry and this is where</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="9.74">we&amp;#39;re at today so Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="331.689" dur="8.85">to keep the system alive they needed</text>
  <text start="336.629" dur="7.871">stimulus now the Fed was tightening the</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="5.761">ECB was winding down and they needed it</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="3.36">from someplace and we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="2.82">before but we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="4.229">that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="6.24">I wanted to head out to the UK for a sec</text>
  <text start="352.089" dur="5.88">here because we are seeing exactly what</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="7.47">we thought was going to happen the</text>
  <text start="357.969" dur="8.01">brexit is in limbo couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="5.1">talked about the brexit on how they were</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="4.68">gonna continually delay and delay and</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="5.93">delay well guess what happened Theresa</text>
  <text start="370.659" dur="6.091">May has address United Kingdom again</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="4.779">after hosting an epic seven hours of</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="4.649">government meetings and told the nation</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="5.671">she intends to delay the brexit again to</text>
  <text start="381.399" dur="6.05">get her deal agreed by Parliament or</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="7.02">else open the door for a softer brexit</text>
  <text start="387.449" dur="8.47">what does this all mean remember Nigel</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="7.17">Farraj he warned that one delay to the</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="6.15">legal brexit date would lead to another</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="5.219">delay and another delay and before you</text>
  <text start="402.069" dur="4.59">knew it they were going to end up</text>
  <text start="403.719" dur="5.16">canceling the brexit actually this is a</text>
  <text start="406.659" dur="5.04">this is cancelling the brexit in</text>
  <text start="408.879" dur="4.621">disguise because you&amp;#39;re really not doing</text>
  <text start="411.699" dur="3.93">anything you&amp;#39;re keeping the country in</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="4.259">limbo and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="415.629" dur="5.97">bankers are doing remember they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="417.759" dur="5.58">gonna let the UK leave and I know</text>
  <text start="421.599" dur="2.91">there&amp;#39;s percentages out there saying</text>
  <text start="423.339" dur="4.89">that there&amp;#39;s going to be a no deal</text>
  <text start="424.509" dur="5.87">brexit I would be shocked if this</text>
  <text start="428.229" dur="5.041">actually happened to be great if it did</text>
  <text start="430.379" dur="4.69">but the central bankers are not just</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="4.35">gonna sit back and say okay you got your</text>

  <text start="437.62" dur="5.28">way you go your way they&amp;#39;re gonna keep</text>
  <text start="439.96" dur="4.739">the entire thing in limbo as long as</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="5.04">they possibly can and try to get the</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="5.791">people to cancel it they&amp;#39;re gonna try it</text>
  <text start="447.94" dur="4.68">and maybe even push a second referendum</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="5.7">to try to say look the people don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="6.6">it anymore see all said and done this is</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="5.939">how the central bankers work they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="495.819" dur="3.511">next day it&amp;#39;s gonna crash the whole</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="4.74">system is gonna come down guess what it</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="6.32">didn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s called fear mongering in</text>

  <text start="512.469" dur="3.69">nothing to do with the brexit this has</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="4.711">to do with the global economy completely</text>
  <text start="516.159" dur="5.88">failing and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in every</text>

  <text start="553.89" dur="6.28">that&amp;#39;s it yes they figured out a way to</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="5.49">keep the system going by manipulation by</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="3.99">stimulus but eventually what happens the</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="4.82">whole thing falls apart</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="5.55">here in the United States the economy</text>

  <text start="584.62" dur="3.45">surface he&amp;#39;s using the tools that the</text>
  <text start="586.9" dur="3.09">central bank in the deep State have been</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="2.97">using for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="3.21">mainstream media won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.76">counter this they&amp;#39;ll try but it&amp;#39;ll be</text>

  <text start="596.8" dur="4.23">country that look the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="4.62">well because during every other</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="4.11">president we looked at the stock market</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="5.4">we looked at unemployment we looked at</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="6.93">GDP and during this time what did they</text>

  <text start="617.23" dur="4.26">tubes they didn&amp;#39;t let anyone know until</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="5.28">the last possible second and then all of</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="6.33">a sudden there&amp;#39;s an emergency well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.52" dur="7.62">seeing durable goods right now they slid</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="7.2">lower more than expected and January&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="5.03">data was revised lower so durable goods</text>

  <text start="640.12" dur="9.99">whatnot those are declining and this is</text>
  <text start="645.76" dur="6.36">an indicator but like we said Trump and</text>
  <text start="650.11" dur="5.54">the Patriots they needed to keep the</text>
  <text start="652.12" dur="7.74">system alive remember China China</text>
  <text start="655.65" dur="10.24">injected a gargantuan 1.1 trillion in</text>
  <text start="659.86" dur="7.92">liquidity back in January of 2019 well</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="6.36">this was coordinated with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="667.78" dur="6.99">to make sure the economy doesn&amp;#39;t fall</text>
  <text start="672.25" dur="5.61">apart now think about what the Patriots</text>
  <text start="674.77" dur="4.17">did they controlled the Fed and they</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="5.19">said listen you&amp;#39;re not raising rates</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="6.87">anymore boom 2019 no interest rates are</text>
  <text start="683.05" dur="4.38">going to be increased 2020 that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="685.81" dur="4.53">whole nother story we&amp;#39;ll wait to get</text>
  <text start="687.43" dur="5.46">there the Patriots also needed some type</text>
  <text start="690.34" dur="6.15">of stimulus the Fed at the time was</text>
  <text start="692.89" dur="4.72">tightening they were dumping their</text>
  <text start="696.49" dur="4.69">balance sheet</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="5.37">so to make them all of a sudden turn</text>
  <text start="701.18" dur="4.86">around and do this it would be very</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="6.33">difficult easier to stop the interest</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="7.08">rates from moving up so they needed an</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="9.15">entity to inject trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="713.12" dur="7.26">into the system and that was China now</text>
  <text start="718.46" dur="4.56">at the time people might have been</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="5.57">thinking well that that can&amp;#39;t be right</text>
  <text start="723.02" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s impossible China is gonna be</text>
  <text start="725.95" dur="5.2">injecting this stimulus and Trump is</text>
  <text start="728.93" dur="5.69">working with you Jinping to keep the</text>
  <text start="731.15" dur="7.83">economy alive well today we have a</text>
  <text start="734.62" dur="7.24">confirmation from the IMF Christine</text>
  <text start="738.98" dur="6.21">Lagarde was out there and she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="6.96">the global economy has lost momentum but</text>
  <text start="745.19" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ll avoid every session first she said</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="3.69">because the Federal Reserve is more</text>
  <text start="750.2" dur="3.84">patient yes if they continually raise</text>
  <text start="752.51" dur="4.82">rates guess what would happen the</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="7.35">economy would have fell apart plus</text>
  <text start="757.33" dur="7.6">because of what China did they injected</text>
  <text start="761.39" dur="4.56">the stimulus now is this gonna hold</text>
  <text start="764.93" dur="4.17">forever</text>
  <text start="765.95" dur="7.53">of course not they don&amp;#39;t need it to hold</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="7.32">forever all they need is to hold the</text>
  <text start="773.48" dur="7.23">economy together long enough for Trump</text>
  <text start="776.42" dur="7.98">to win the election now why would they</text>
  <text start="780.71" dur="9.21">need that so they can implement part two</text>
  <text start="784.4" dur="7.41">of this plan because we know and we have</text>
  <text start="789.92" dur="3.63">had confirmation of this also they were</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="4.92">going to and they&amp;#39;re still gonna try to</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="6.33">use the economy against Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="796.73" dur="6.33">going to link the economy to trump and</text>
  <text start="799.88" dur="5.52">if it fails he is to blame</text>
  <text start="803.06" dur="4.29">well the economy&amp;#39;s not going to fail</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="3.9">just like they thought the Moller report</text>
  <text start="807.35" dur="4.35">was gonna show Russian collusion and</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="5.22">obstruction the Muller report the</text>
  <text start="811.7" dur="6.36">summary part showed the opposite they</text>
  <text start="814.52" dur="6.66">were completely wrong Brennan even</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="5.46">admitted well he got wrong Intel what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.18" dur="5.19">happening here is they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="4.819">new Intel they&amp;#39;re still working off of</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="5.569">the old in</text>
  <text start="828.339" dur="6.12">why because the Patriots are in control</text>
  <text start="831.939" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re in control of what is happening</text>
  <text start="834.459" dur="6.87">with Moller they&amp;#39;re in control with with</text>
  <text start="838.329" dur="6.031">the investigations they&amp;#39;re in control of</text>
  <text start="841.329" dur="5.88">the economy they&amp;#39;re in control of the</text>
  <text start="844.36" dur="7.62">central bank they&amp;#39;re in control of all</text>
  <text start="847.209" dur="8.461">of this and they stopped the recession</text>
  <text start="851.98" dur="6.18">from happening in 2020 now this does not</text>
  <text start="855.67" dur="5.609">mean that we&amp;#39;re not going to enter a</text>
  <text start="858.16" dur="5.64">recession I think Trump wants this to</text>
  <text start="861.279" dur="4.021">happen during his second term first of</text>
  <text start="863.8" dur="5.19">all he&amp;#39;s not going to be running for</text>
  <text start="865.3" dur="6.12">re-election again third of all he can do</text>
  <text start="868.99" dur="4.62">amazing things in his second term</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="4.769">because he doesn&amp;#39;t care about being</text>
  <text start="873.61" dur="5.19">reelected and he can really push the</text>
  <text start="876.189" dur="5.94">envelope in his second term he can go</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="6.539">after the central bank he can push the</text>
  <text start="882.129" dur="5.731">health care plan he can push the arrests</text>
  <text start="885.339" dur="6.24">he can push the trials he can push</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="7.409">everything at this point and you can see</text>
  <text start="891.579" dur="5.911">how everything is coming together this</text>
  <text start="895.269" dur="4.74">is all part of the plan but you need to</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="4.529">be prepared because we are going to be</text>
  <text start="900.009" dur="4.19">going through some tough times they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.019" dur="4.29">making it as easy as possible and</text>
  <text start="904.199" dur="3.911">they&amp;#39;re hoping that it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as</text>
  <text start="906.309" dur="4.53">many people but remember we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="908.11" dur="5.43">off one system which is based on debt</text>
  <text start="910.839" dur="5.131">and we&amp;#39;re going to a sound money system</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="4.529">so there&amp;#39;s going to be bumps in the road</text>
  <text start="915.97" dur="5.01">as we switch over there are bumps in the</text>
  <text start="918.069" dur="5.37">road when we switch over from a solid</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="6.079">system with hardly any debt into a</text>
  <text start="923.439" dur="6.33">system that was based on nothing oil and</text>
  <text start="927.059" dur="5.53">it was a bumpy ride there was high</text>
  <text start="929.769" dur="4.32">unemployment other places around the</text>
  <text start="932.589" dur="3.391">world were having trouble there were gas</text>
  <text start="934.089" dur="3.901">lines there are many things that were</text>
  <text start="935.98" dur="3.449">wrong we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="3.269">once again and this is why you need to</text>
