  <text start="66.55" dur="5.91">rejected next reject the central bank</text>
  <text start="69.79" dur="4.5">system now before I get started I wanted</text>
  <text start="72.46" dur="4.08">to talk about debt and how it affects</text>
  <text start="74.29" dur="4.439">each and every one of us and yes we hear</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="4.17">the word debt but what happens if I told</text>
  <text start="78.729" dur="3.421">you that you owed sixty five thousand</text>
  <text start="80.71" dur="3.39">three hundred eighteen dollars to the</text>

  <text start="102.82" dur="3.99">that is what they&amp;#39;re telling us most</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="3.93">likely it&amp;#39;s a lot more and we know the</text>
  <text start="106.81" dur="3.63">US government is continually borrowing</text>
  <text start="108.7" dur="4.47">they still haven&amp;#39;t paid off the second</text>

  <text start="154.57" dur="7.28">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="7.65">the plan to sidestep globalism where</text>
  <text start="161.85" dur="3.99">globalism is being dismantled right in</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="4.26">front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="6.01">soon the central banks that will be the</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="4.62">next target and Trump has already</text>
  <text start="171.85" dur="4.53">confirmed this at the UN which we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="4.83">to in just a minute but first I wanted</text>
  <text start="176.38" dur="3.72">to talk about the brexit and we know the</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="2.67">negotiations have been going on for</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="3.99">quite a while</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="5.19">and Theresa May it looks like she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.09" dur="5.81">actually putting on a show and it looks</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="7.56">like that these brexit negotiations</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re going nowhere now she has no</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="4.74">intention of saying strong on the brexit</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="5.819">negotiations remember the people in</text>
  <text start="199" dur="6.45">power the central bankers they have a</text>
  <text start="202.299" dur="5.36">completely different agenda than the</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="5.25">people I mean we saw it happen in Greece</text>
  <text start="207.659" dur="5.321">the people in Greece voted for it</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="3.78">tsipras they thought he was going to go</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="5.879">up against the central banking system</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="8.61">and he folded same things happening out</text>
  <text start="218.859" dur="8.19">in the UK the people wanted to exit the</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="5.94">EU they voted on it and of course the</text>
  <text start="227.049" dur="6.75">leaders are saying yes were with you but</text>
  <text start="229.03" dur="6.359">nothing was done now her job was always</text>
  <text start="233.799" dur="3.901">to deliver a brexit deal that was in</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="4.051">effect no deal she was to thread the</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="3.75">needle that kept the UK in the European</text>
  <text start="239.44" dur="4.409">Union for for everything that matters</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="4.259">the customs and trade unions while</text>
  <text start="243.849" dur="4.2">selling the illusion of an independent</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="4.68">Britain that has no voting rights on the</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="3.961">floor of the EU Parliament and she is</text>
  <text start="250.389" dur="4.051">rapidly coming to the end of her rope</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="4.529">because let&amp;#39;s seriously step back for a</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="4.169">moment and look at the complete</text>
  <text start="256.539" dur="4.38">irrelevance e of the Northern Ireland</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="4.981">border which is the issue of the day</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="5.641">holding up the entire deal and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="6.48">complete nonsense it&amp;#39;s a stall tactic</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="5.22">and you can see that the leaders there</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="4.89">in line with the central banking</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="5.4">establishment and to me this whole</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="5.429">brexit deal is starting to look like a</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="5.459">gigantic show and it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="5.161">gonna go absolutely nowhere but we will</text>
  <text start="282.639" dur="7.02">see as time goes on we see down in</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="6.27">Mexico that the New Mexican president he</text>
  <text start="289.659" dur="5.101">came out and he&amp;#39;s going up against the</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="4.98">central bank around 200 central bank</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="4.35">employees including 20 senior executives</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.31">have left their posts at the Bank of</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="5.97">Mexico since presidential elections on</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="6.59">July 1st now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.269">the new president they call him an lo</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="4.839">he&amp;#39;s out there and he is slashing</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="3.631">salaries for senior government officials</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="3.271">and bureaucrats</text>
  <text start="314.98" dur="5.25">part of a sweeping cost-cutting measures</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="7.41">and he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="6.66">Mexico is bankrupt and he&amp;#39;s letting the</text>
  <text start="324.22" dur="4.74">central bank know if the economy</text>
  <text start="326.89" dur="4.29">completely implode it&amp;#39;s not because of</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="5.28">him it&amp;#39;s because of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="6.69">if it does implode he&amp;#39;s gonna come after</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="5.91">the central bank because he said in the</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="4.56">following statement the country is going</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="5.16">through a very tough economic situation</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="4.59">a situation of bankruptcy we may not be</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="4.56">able to fulfill all the demands being</text>
  <text start="347.02" dur="5.73">made of us but rest assured we will</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="5.31">fulfill all we promised in the campaign</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="5.07">anyone on to say if the economic</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="4.74">conditions deteriorate it will not be</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="4.65">the president of the Republic&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="5.49">but rather due to external circumstances</text>
  <text start="362.47" dur="6.12">or the Bank of Mexico&amp;#39;s poor handling of</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="5.4">financial policy so right there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.59" dur="4.92">calling out the central bank criticizing</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="4.68">the central bank in Mexico the same</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="4.62">thing that Trump did here in the United</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="4.47">States and this is how it begins they</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="4.23">start calling out the central bank and</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="5.97">we can see that there are many countries</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="5.88">around the world that are calling out</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="3.48">the central bank Italy has been doing</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="4.68">this for a while saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="5.27">gonna leave the EU and again we go back</text>
  <text start="392.92" dur="4.32">to Russia where they said listen</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="4.66">everyone needs to start using their</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="4.83">national currency instead of a</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="4.29">centralized currency and eventually what</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re going to say is while you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="5.07">using your national currency take</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="4.71">control over the central bank this is</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="4.17">where this is all headed now the central</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="4.29">banks are very worried about any other</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="4.17">type of monetary system except theirs</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="3.75">they don&amp;#39;t like precious metals they</text>
  <text start="417.04" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t like the cryptocurrency market and</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="4.5">we can see in the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re continually manipulating it just</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="4.59">like the precious metals market where</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.59">they dump crypto currencies to bring</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="4.08">down the mark to make it look like yes</text>
  <text start="429.64" dur="3.6">see this is not a stable market you</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="3.03">really don&amp;#39;t want to be in it it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="433.24" dur="3.84">nowhere you should really be in the</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="4.65">dollar and they&amp;#39;ve done this with gold</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="3.72">and silver over a very long time you</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="3.39">know what happens when the central</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="3.9">banking system implodes and we come off</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="2.97">of the central banking system all of a</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="4.32">sudden you&amp;#39;re gonna see precious metals</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="6.109">cryptocurrency shoot up because they</text>
  <text start="449.02" dur="6.239">like anything challenging their system</text>
  <text start="452.009" dur="4.84">now we see that Case Shiller has finally</text>
  <text start="455.259" dur="4.741">emitted and his report and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.849" dur="7.111">reporting on home prices that home</text>
  <text start="460" dur="7.71">prices in July they have risen at the</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="6.209">slowest pace since August last year now</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="5.1">remember they look at 20 different</text>
  <text start="470.169" dur="5.97">cities they look at the property values</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="5.88">and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="4.981">property values are declining right now</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="4.469">actually if you go back in time and you</text>
  <text start="481.12" dur="4.079">look at 2012 all the way to 2014</text>
  <text start="483.159" dur="3.781">property prices were a lot higher</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="3.931">they&amp;#39;ve come down quite a bit</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="5.52">and they&amp;#39;ve been flatlined since around</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="5.31">2014 and now they&amp;#39;re dropping which</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about quite a bit</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="4.05">this was the biggest miss since May of</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="4.38">2016</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="5.07">July marked the fourth consecutive month</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="5.429">that annual price gains in the 20-city</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="5.22">index decelerated that&amp;#39;s in sync with</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="4.111">other reports indicating housing is</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="4.29">stalling as buyers shy away from the</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="4.139">high prices because the mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="6.149">again are moving up kicking them out of</text>
  <text start="515.169" dur="6.54">the market and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="6.001">same exact things that we saw prior to</text>
  <text start="521.709" dur="5.37">2008 sales of existing single homes have</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="3.809">dropped each month for the last six</text>
  <text start="527.079" dur="5.07">months and in our at the levels of July</text>
  <text start="529.029" dur="6.451">2016 the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="532.149" dur="7.531">completely falling apart and we know the</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="6.84">entire plan is to move away from the</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="5.219">globalist system to move away from the</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="6.9">central banking system to pump the</text>
  <text start="544.899" dur="5.94">economy up to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="549.22" dur="4.29">economy&amp;#39;s doing better than ever and</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="5.581">this will take the heat off of Trump</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="6.449">while he tries to bring manufacturing</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="6">back to this country tried to set up the</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="4.471">country for this major reset and we see</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="4.979">there are many other countries looking</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="4.349">at a payment system outside of the Swift</text>
  <text start="567.399" dur="2.821">system and China&amp;#39;s done it Russia has</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="3.541">done it now it looks like the European</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="4.14">markets are looking to do this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="3.509">preparing for a reset this is what</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for for quite a</text>
  <text start="575.829" dur="4.171">while actually before this they thought</text>
  <text start="578.11" dur="3.93">the central bank would move everything</text>
  <text start="580" dur="3.45">to China they were going to set up a</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="2.97">completely different</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="5.55">but now we see this is not in the cards</text>
  <text start="585.01" dur="6.45">anymore things have changed now the</text>
  <text start="589" dur="4.38">tariffs that we&amp;#39;re seeing in all these</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="3.54">trade wars that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="3.48">out there talking about they were going</text>
  <text start="595" dur="4.2">to use this to say this is why the</text>
  <text start="596.86" dur="4.56">economy fell apart but Trump has been</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="4.02">pumping up the economy so they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="3.84">it it&amp;#39;s very difficult to say the</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="4.35">economy&amp;#39;s falling apart when the economy</text>
  <text start="605.26" dur="6.27">in statistical information is getting a</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="7.41">lot better so his plan is to force big</text>
  <text start="611.53" dur="5.01">companies to pull out of China and come</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="3.95">back to the United States</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="5.24">bring back the manufacturing plants</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="6.1">bring back the corporations and</text>
  <text start="621.78" dur="5.23">hopefully he&amp;#39;s able to do this before</text>
  <text start="625.03" dur="4.11">2020 at least bring some of them back</text>
  <text start="627.01" dur="4.59">now this is not going to make America</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="4.29">great again when he brings him back</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="3.78">because the next phase is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="4.2">the central banking system but you need</text>
  <text start="635.38" dur="3.48">to start bringing these companies back</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="2.52">because if you get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="3.45">banking system and we have no</text>
  <text start="640.15" dur="4.2">manufacturing the economy&amp;#39;s dead the</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="4.38">economy&amp;#39;s dead right now we&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="4.32">an illusionary world that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="4.35">and he&amp;#39;s been planning this with Xi</text>
  <text start="648.67" dur="4.62">Jinping this has been planned since the</text>
  <text start="651.04" dur="4.68">beginning they&amp;#39;re on board with these</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="5.19">tariffs so tariffs are gonna force</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="4.02">companies back to the US because</text>
  <text start="658.48" dur="3.3">remember for years</text>
  <text start="659.74" dur="4.4">the central bank the globalists they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="661.78" dur="4.65">been moving manufacturing corporations</text>
  <text start="664.14" dur="5.25">out of this country because they were</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="4.92">preparing for a one-world government and</text>
  <text start="669.39" dur="4.87">they were trying to bring the United</text>
  <text start="671.35" dur="4.83">States down to the level of the third</text>
  <text start="674.26" dur="4.32">world nations this way all countries</text>
  <text start="676.18" dur="5.22">would be equal that was their plan</text>
  <text start="678.58" dur="3.87">now tariffs are not going to have the</text>
  <text start="681.4" dur="4.05">effect that everyone thinks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.45" dur="4.83">going to have because China has the belt</text>
  <text start="685.45" dur="5.22">and Road the Silk Road and has the</text>
  <text start="687.28" dur="7.77">ability now to find replacements for the</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="5.97">US market or their US customers so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="3.39">not going to be so hard for China for a</text>
  <text start="696.64" dur="3.24">couple of reasons one is that the</text>
  <text start="698.44" dur="3.99">Chinese goods are still relatively</text>
  <text start="699.88" dur="4.35">affordable priced so developing</text>
  <text start="702.43" dur="4.2">countries or countries in Europe or</text>
  <text start="704.23" dur="6.6">Latin America are still able to afford</text>
  <text start="706.63" dur="6.36">these products remember Trump has been</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="4.29">working with the Chinese all this talk</text>
  <text start="712.99" dur="2.93">about Oh Chinese we&amp;#39;re going to get them</text>
  <text start="715.12" dur="2.54">no</text>
  <text start="715.92" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re not gonna get the Chinese we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.66" dur="3.63">gonna get the deep state that has been</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="6.109">operating inside of the Chinese</text>
  <text start="721.29" dur="8.279">government inside of the Chinese country</text>
  <text start="725.329" dur="6.04">the plan to undo everything the</text>
  <text start="729.569" dur="4.411">globalists have been doing the plan to</text>
  <text start="731.369" dur="4.68">get rid of what they were doing is in</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="5.159">process right now that&amp;#39;s what is</text>
  <text start="736.049" dur="5.88">happening let&amp;#39;s take for example soybean</text>
  <text start="739.139" dur="3.51">market now China has been importing</text>
  <text start="741.929" dur="2.94">soybeans</text>
  <text start="742.649" dur="4.891">well they reduce the amount that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.869" dur="4.291">importing from the US and instead they</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="4.529">turn to other countries like Brazil</text>
  <text start="749.16" dur="5.88">which also produces a lot of soybeans so</text>
  <text start="752.069" dur="6.781">with the belton road China will have the</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="6.509">ability to sell and to export and import</text>
  <text start="758.85" dur="5.729">their products with really not that much</text>
  <text start="761.549" dur="5.16">changing in China the United States will</text>
  <text start="764.579" dur="4.35">benefit because these tariffs will bring</text>
  <text start="766.709" dur="4.86">back manufacturing to the United States</text>
  <text start="768.929" dur="4.981">this is the plan for the reset now</text>
  <text start="771.569" dur="5.01">remember the globalists were moving</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="4.019">everything off to China and it took many</text>
  <text start="776.579" dur="4.59">many years to do this how do they do</text>
  <text start="777.929" dur="5.31">this with taxes with regulation they</text>
  <text start="781.169" dur="5.34">made it impossible for companies to stay</text>
  <text start="783.239" dur="5.1">here and to manufacture here and they</text>
  <text start="786.509" dur="3.45">said hey look look at China look at the</text>
  <text start="788.339" dur="3.391">emerging markets it&amp;#39;s so much cheaper</text>
  <text start="789.959" dur="4.081">over there there&amp;#39;s hardly any tax relay</text>
  <text start="791.73" dur="4.109">regulations there&amp;#39;s really not much so</text>
  <text start="794.04" dur="3.629">let&amp;#39;s move the companies out over there</text>
  <text start="795.839" dur="3.48">they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="797.669" dur="3.991">I mean if you look at the number of</text>
  <text start="799.319" dur="4.89">regulations in a number of taxes who</text>
  <text start="801.66" dur="3.299">would want to run a company here in the</text>
  <text start="804.209" dur="3.03">United States</text>
  <text start="804.959" dur="5.28">so what Trump&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="807.239" dur="5.07">remove a lot of these taxes remove a lot</text>
  <text start="810.239" dur="6.06">of these regulations to give these</text>
  <text start="812.309" dur="6.72">companies incentive to come back or to</text>
  <text start="816.299" dur="4.83">maybe to open up a manufacturing plant</text>
  <text start="819.029" dur="4.5">and have both in both locations and</text>
  <text start="821.129" dur="5.221">eventually bring the companies fully</text>
  <text start="823.529" dur="4.71">back to the United States this is what</text>
  <text start="826.35" dur="3.899">is in process right now and Trump was at</text>
  <text start="828.239" dur="5.55">the UN he was giving a speech and</text>
  <text start="830.249" dur="6.12">basically rejected internationalism and</text>
  <text start="833.789" dur="5.85">embraced the nationalist populism</text>
  <text start="836.369" dur="6.81">that Trump has champion Trump blasted</text>
  <text start="839.639" dur="5.67">the ideology of globalism multinational</text>
  <text start="843.179" dur="5.611">organizations like the UN that he said</text>
  <text start="845.309" dur="5.161">infringe on national sovereignty Trump</text>
  <text start="848.79" dur="3.42">urged other nations to look out for</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="4.41">themselves and their own interest and</text>
  <text start="852.21" dur="5.07">allow the u.s. to do the same he said I</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="4.53">honor every nation to pursue its own</text>
  <text start="857.28" dur="4.17">customs beliefs and traditions the</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="5.37">United States will not tell you how to</text>
  <text start="861.45" dur="6.21">live or work or worship will only ask</text>
  <text start="864.78" dur="5.37">that you honor our sovereignty in return</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="5.16">Trump vowed that the US would not be</text>
  <text start="870.15" dur="5.31">taking advantage of any longer and slam</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="4.65">both its friends and foes for taking</text>
  <text start="875.46" dur="7.59">advantage of the USS defense spending</text>
  <text start="877.47" dur="8.07">and its trading policies now Trump has</text>
  <text start="883.05" dur="5.1">accused countries of abusing the US</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="5.31">markets openness charging some nations</text>
  <text start="888.15" dur="4.71">with relentless product dumping forced</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="4.5">technology transfer and the theft of</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="4.89">intellectual property in a direct attack</text>
  <text start="895.35" dur="5.07">on China Trump pointed to the loss of</text>
  <text start="897.75" dur="4.74">three million US manufacturing jobs -</text>
  <text start="900.42" dur="4.68">what he referred to as market</text>
  <text start="902.49" dur="5.49">distortions those days are over</text>
  <text start="905.1" dur="6.33">we will no longer tolerate such abuse he</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="7.38">said and he also said the world trade</text>
  <text start="911.43" dur="6.57">system is in dire need of change China</text>
  <text start="915.36" dur="5.61">says the world trade system is in dire</text>
  <text start="918" dur="5.01">need of change the BRIC nations say the</text>
  <text start="920.97" dur="4.5">World Trade Organization is in dire need</text>
  <text start="923.01" dur="4.98">of change Russia says the World Trade</text>
  <text start="925.47" dur="5.58">Organization is in dire need of change</text>
  <text start="927.99" dur="5.04">he went on to say that the world trade</text>
  <text start="931.05" dur="6.6">organizations those countries that were</text>
  <text start="933.03" dur="7.47">admitted to the WTO violate every single</text>
  <text start="937.65" dur="5.07">principle on which the organization is</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="5.34">based of course it does</text>
  <text start="942.72" dur="6.53">because their agenda is not to help each</text>
  <text start="945.84" dur="7.56">country to help trade it&amp;#39;s to set up a</text>
  <text start="949.25" dur="6.94">centralized one-world government with</text>
  <text start="953.4" dur="5.61">one currency that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="956.19" dur="5.79">these non elected leaders will rule over</text>
  <text start="959.01" dur="5.13">this is what the TPP was all about they</text>
  <text start="961.98" dur="4.53">were going to set a court system above</text>
  <text start="964.14" dur="4.17">each and every government and they would</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="3.99">have the last word this was the first</text>
  <text start="968.31" dur="4.02">phase that they were going to use to try</text>
  <text start="970.5" dur="4.68">to control the entire world but of</text>
  <text start="972.33" dur="4.68">course that was completely terminated</text>
  <text start="975.18" dur="4.35">when Trump came into the office into</text>
  <text start="977.01" dur="5.01">office if we had another person in</text>
  <text start="979.53" dur="2.79">office guess what we would have that</text>
  <text start="982.02" dur="4.41">right</text>
  <text start="982.32" dur="7.14">now instead we&amp;#39;re making a decentralized</text>
  <text start="986.43" dur="7.83">trade deal with every single country not</text>
  <text start="989.46" dur="7.23">based on one centralized system this is</text>
  <text start="994.26" dur="3.81">what the Belton road is all about and we</text>
  <text start="996.69" dur="4.5">can see that we&amp;#39;re moving in this</text>
