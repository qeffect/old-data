  <text start="34.84" dur="6">episode 919 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="37.69" dur="5.07">15 2016 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="40.84" dur="3.96">the central bankers continue to</text>
  <text start="42.76" dur="5.49">manipulate the economy as it contracts</text>
  <text start="44.8" dur="6.24">into a collapse let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="48.25" dur="4.92">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="51.04" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing the market continually</text>
  <text start="53.17" dur="5.13">fluctuate and the market is not really</text>
  <text start="56.44" dur="4.47">any type of indicator of how the economy</text>
  <text start="58.3" dur="4.77">is doing this is the government the</text>
  <text start="60.91" dur="4.35">central bankers tool to try to convince</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="4.23">everyone that everything is fine because</text>
  <text start="65.26" dur="4.56">in their minds if they keep this alive</text>
  <text start="67.3" dur="4.56">and they keep this pumped up everyone</text>
  <text start="69.82" dur="3.6">believes the economy is doing well but</text>
  <text start="71.86" dur="4.68">this is not something that we need to</text>
  <text start="73.42" dur="6.87">look at because the market doesn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="6.33">us anything because it&amp;#39;s one big game</text>
  <text start="80.29" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s manipulation and it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.87" dur="4.26">show the true picture of what the</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="6">economy is doing so we look at other</text>
  <text start="87.13" dur="6.419">indicators and we&amp;#39;ve noticed that a lot</text>
  <text start="90.31" dur="6.479">of stores are closing men&amp;#39;s wearhouse</text>
  <text start="93.549" dur="6.481">sports authority macy sears JC Penney&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.789" dur="5.671">barnes &amp;amp; noble on and on and on with the</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="5.549">list and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="102.46" dur="5.97">retail sales are continually contracting</text>
  <text start="105.579" dur="4.921">and we see that retail sales have</text>
  <text start="108.43" dur="3.84">dropped about point five four percent in</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="4.64">the last two months this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="6.809">to cut sequential drop in a year and</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="7.93">retail sales down most in a year and</text>
  <text start="119.079" dur="8.04">when we look at this we see that retail</text>
  <text start="123.07" dur="7.02">is in a downward trajectory and it is</text>
  <text start="127.119" dur="4.951">very weak in the recessionary levels and</text>
  <text start="130.09" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s getting weaker as time goes on and</text>
  <text start="132.07" dur="6.39">when we look at what is happening here</text>
  <text start="135.31" dur="5.84">we can see that many of the key segments</text>
  <text start="138.46" dur="6.99">in retails they&amp;#39;re posting declines</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="7.12">Motor Vehicles is down- 0.2% furniture</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="4.86">and home furnishings down- 0.5% now you</text>
  <text start="148.27" dur="5.549">would think that would be up since you</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="8.16">know housing market and real estate is</text>
  <text start="153.819" dur="7.531">booming well this shows us that no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="5.46">not booming because this would be up</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="4.979">just like we saw a prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="3.99">going back where people are buying a new</text>
  <text start="166.329" dur="3.8">house they like to get new furniture</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="4.11">they like to furnish their house and</text>
  <text start="170.129" dur="4.991">we&amp;#39;re not seeing this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="7.17">electronics are down negative 0.1% food</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="6.83">and beverage down- 0.2% gasoline prices</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="5.069">have come down so that&amp;#39;s down- 4.4%</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="5.92">general merchandise is down negative</text>
  <text start="184.269" dur="6.241">point two percent and online sales of</text>
  <text start="187.87" dur="4.019">course everyone uses this excuse that no</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="4.05">one is shopping in the brick and mortar</text>
  <text start="191.889" dur="7.47">shops everything&amp;#39;s going online but</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="8.429">again this is not true online sales are</text>
  <text start="199.359" dur="6.66">down negative point two percent so what</text>
  <text start="202.989" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that retail is</text>
  <text start="206.019" dur="5.97">continually contracting sales are not</text>
  <text start="209.319" dur="4.741">picking up and we&amp;#39;re seeing things</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="5.67">completely fall apart and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="5.879">see more stores come out and say okay we</text>
  <text start="217.659" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t do this anymore we need to close</text>
  <text start="219.939" dur="7.321">stores we need to lay off people because</text>
  <text start="223.209" dur="6.721">the economy isn&amp;#39;t there now out in the</text>
  <text start="227.26" dur="6.24">subprime auto arena where they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="6.209">pumping up auto sales and they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="5.729">loans to anyone that has a heartbeat we</text>
  <text start="236.139" dur="5.28">know that the subprime auto loans are</text>
  <text start="239.229" dur="4.741">being packaged just like when we had the</text>
  <text start="241.419" dur="4.5">subprime securities and housing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="3.629">doing the same exact thing and what</text>
  <text start="245.919" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="247.599" dur="5.941">delinquencies on the subprime auto debt</text>
  <text start="250.659" dur="7.38">packaged into securities reached a high</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="6.78">not seen since October 1996 late</text>
  <text start="258.039" dur="4.071">payments continue to worsen in February</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="5.7">and this is according to fitch ratings</text>
  <text start="262.11" dur="6.1">the number of car borrowers who were</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="4.86">more than 60 days late on their bills in</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="6.239">February rose eleven point six percent</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="5.279">from last year bringing the delinquency</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="4.71">rate to about five point one six percent</text>
  <text start="276.159" dur="5.371">Fitch row a Monday in a report during</text>
  <text start="279.159" dur="5.241">the financial crisis delinquencies</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="6.509">peaked at five point zero four percent</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="6.82">so we&amp;#39;re at five point one six percent</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="4.891">during the financial crisis we hit five</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.02">point zero four percent now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="3.75">interesting is that these economic</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="2.72">indicators that we are continually</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="6.209">looking at</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="8.079">we&amp;#39;re by path we are passing the 2008</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="6.24">crisis numbers and things are</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="6.63">dramatically accelerating to the</text>
  <text start="309.129" dur="5.491">downside and if you notice as more and</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="7.231">more of these economic indicators come</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="8.729">out the numbers are consistently moving</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="6.269">downward which tells us the economy is</text>
  <text start="323.349" dur="4.831">not improving whatsoever now when we</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="5.041">look at the US business inventory to</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="6.93">sales ratio we see that total business</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="5.91">inventory sales rose about 1.40 this is</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.47">the highest since May of 2009 with a</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="4.19">point four percent slump in sales and a</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="6.679">point one percent rise in inventories</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="8.979">this tells us that the recession is</text>
  <text start="346.259" dur="7.601">closing in now remember at the height of</text>
  <text start="350.289" dur="9.211">2008 going into 2009 we were</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="13.049">approximately at 1.52 we are currently</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="11.909">at 1.4 prior to 2008 we were currently</text>
  <text start="366.909" dur="7.741">at about 1.2 seven so you can see we are</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="8.341">on an upward trend and we are getting</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="6.78">close to that period of a major collapse</text>
  <text start="379.75" dur="4.8">of the system because if we take it</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="8.849">further and we go back to 2001 we were</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="7.79">at 1.42 and we&amp;#39;re at one point four and</text>
  <text start="390.279" dur="5.94">in two thousand one we had a recession</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="5.77">2008 we had the Great Recession and now</text>
  <text start="396.219" dur="5.431">it&amp;#39;s being pumped up and we&amp;#39;re almost at</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="8.58">the level of 2001 approaching 2008 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.65" dur="10.769">back to where we started the only thing</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="8.52">that has changed since 2008 is how the</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="6.171">central bank&amp;#39;s manipulate the economy</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="6">and how well they can create the bubbles</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="6.699">how well they can keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="7.59">alive because everything else is falling</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="5.731">apart now the Empire Fed miraculously</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="5.31">surged to the most since 2000</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="6.17">10 they were expecting a negative 10.5</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="6.869">and then all of a sudden out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="5.11">it went all the way up to point 62 now</text>
  <text start="440.979" dur="4.261">this kind of looks like a dead cow</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="4.829">pounds and most likely the next month</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;re going to see this drop quite a bit</text>
  <text start="447.129" dur="6.03">well it&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="449.229" dur="5.611">that we had this rise in the Empire fed</text>
  <text start="453.159" dur="4.861">manufacturing but the number of</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="7.229">employees dropped once again in a</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="6.389">seven-month contraction so what is going</text>
  <text start="462.069" dur="3.991">on there most likely it&amp;#39;s a dead cat</text>
  <text start="464.409" dur="4.41">bounce and we&amp;#39;ll see this drop</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="4.859">dramatically next month now the Baltic</text>
  <text start="468.819" dur="5.611">Dry Index is starting to slow it has</text>
  <text start="470.919" dur="5.22">reached 396 and as this week goes on</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="3.329">we&amp;#39;ll have to see if it starts leveling</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="4.261">off and of course with the corporate</text>
  <text start="477.759" dur="3.931">media the US government the talking</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="3.03">heads will call this this is the new</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="3.75">normal now this is what the recovery</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="3.69">looks like and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="4.199">watch that very very carefully bank of</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="5.31">america they are out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.639" dur="5.28">saying the smart money is leaving the</text>
  <text start="492.43" dur="4.5">market altogether they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="3.81">buybacks by corporate clients have</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="3.9">accelerated last week to the highest</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="4.37">level since august and are tracking</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="6.269">above levels we saw this time last year</text>
  <text start="503.099" dur="5.861">so smart money sold their shares to</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="4.47">corporations where they&amp;#39;re buying back</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="6.329">their stock this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="511.569" dur="6.15">right now and what does that tell us it</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="5.161">tells us that they&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="4.171">stock market and you know what happens</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="2.85">when the whole thing falls apart and all</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="3.18">these companies owned their own shares</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="4.789">the whole thing is going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="5.7">this is where we are headed right now</text>
  <text start="528.089" dur="5.171">now bank of america sang their clients</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="5.069">were net sellers of US stocks for the</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="5.37">seventh consecutive week net sales of</text>
  <text start="535.839" dur="5.161">about 3.7 billion were the largest since</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.1">September and led by institutional</text>
  <text start="541" dur="6.51">clients hedge funds private clients were</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="6.72">all net sellers and we see that they</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="6.87">were selling and corporations were</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="6.66">buying and this is what keeps the market</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="5.94">propped up now very interestingly last</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="5.55">week European Central Bank Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="3.99">announced a much bigger and wider</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="4.77">ranging stimulus package</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="8.13">that basically anyone expected they</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="9.9">didn&amp;#39;t expect this at all now the ECB is</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="6.8">buying bonds but as they buy these bonds</text>
  <text start="577.33" dur="5.699">this has no impact on employment</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="5.38">business investment inflation lending or</text>
  <text start="583.029" dur="4.801">growth it has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="6.659">anything it has to do with manipulating</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="7.34">and keeping the market alive to keep</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="7.401">this illusion that we&amp;#39;ve been recovering</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="6.25">now what he&amp;#39;s doing right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="4.78">creating a temporary incentive for</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="4.29">corporations to buy back more of their</text>
  <text start="603.46" dur="5.91">own shares while providing more cheap</text>
  <text start="605.71" dur="6.36">cash for banks to roll over there to</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="5.64">over the their debt which otherwise</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="7.14">would have dragged them into default so</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="6.06">Draghi turbocharged QE and he shifted</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="4.65">more cash into overpriced financial</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="4.62">assets while perpetrating the illusion</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="7.44">that the EU banking system is still</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="7.71">solvent well corporations don&amp;#39;t expand</text>
  <text start="631.3" dur="6.84">their operation or hire more workers</text>
  <text start="633.4" dur="6.63">when demand is weak and demand is weak</text>
  <text start="638.14" dur="3.63">mainly because central banks have worked</text>
  <text start="640.03" dur="3.63">with their government counterparts to</text>
  <text start="641.77" dur="5.85">keep it week by slashing deficits and</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="6.66">intensifying austerity so corporations</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="5.7">only have one thing or two things to do</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="6.03">lay off people buy back their shares cut</text>
  <text start="653.32" dur="10.85">costs because they can&amp;#39;t be profitable</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="10.739">and the ECB the Fed they know this they</text>
  <text start="664.17" dur="6.4">know that consumption in the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="667.089" dur="4.981">shrinking not expanding and the reason</text>
  <text start="670.57" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s shrinking is because unemployment</text>
  <text start="672.07" dur="6.81">is high unemployment is high and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="8.28">enforcing company governments to push</text>
  <text start="678.88" dur="8.43">austerity to keep inflation low now as</text>
  <text start="683.77" dur="8.28">long as inflation stays low they can</text>
  <text start="687.31" dur="7.14">provide cheap money to Wall Street so</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="4.14">Draghi&amp;#39;s corporate bond a bond buying</text>
  <text start="694.45" dur="3.36">program is actually another handout for</text>
  <text start="696.19" dur="2.67">Wall Street</text>
  <text start="697.81" dur="4.74">Wall Street was the single largest</text>
  <text start="698.86" dur="5.4">source of bond sales this year it looks</text>
  <text start="702.55" dur="4.56">like retail investors are calling it</text>
  <text start="704.26" dur="6.57">quits and cashing in and companies are</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="9.3">buying back the stocks to keep this</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="8.699">entire illusion alive so corporations</text>
  <text start="716.41" dur="6.24">are forcing the market higher by buying</text>
  <text start="719.529" dur="4.381">back their stocks the retail investor is</text>
  <text start="722.65" dur="2.25">getting completely out of the market</text>
  <text start="723.91" dur="6.38">because they&amp;#39;re not optimistic</text>
  <text start="724.9" dur="5.39">whatsoever profits are declining and</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="6.43">there&amp;#39;s no way out of this because</text>
