  <text start="66.71" dur="5.159">know something since the start of this</text>
  <text start="69.34" dur="4.119">since we&amp;#39;ve been receiving this debt</text>
  <text start="71.869" dur="4.411">there has been no economic growth</text>
  <text start="73.459" dur="4.591">whatsoever we&amp;#39;re not doing anything to</text>
  <text start="76.28" dur="3.27">spur economic growth and this is why</text>
  <text start="78.05" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re looking at the BRIC nations and</text>
  <text start="79.55" dur="4.5">we see Greece and France and Italy</text>
  <text start="81.53" dur="4.77">looking at China to make deals to spur</text>
  <text start="84.05" dur="4.95">economic growth and we can see right now</text>

  <text start="98.42" dur="2.97">going to get about a million signatures</text>
  <text start="99.679" dur="4.14">and then they&amp;#39;re going to take their</text>
  <text start="101.39" dur="4.83">case to the legislators and they will</text>
  <text start="103.819" dur="6.811">have to talk to us because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="106.22" dur="7.319">seeing is that the people are looking at</text>
  <text start="110.63" dur="5.549">this and saying enough is enough and</text>
  <text start="113.539" dur="4.021">italy right now is looking to say you</text>
  <text start="116.179" dur="4.56">know what maybe we should separate</text>
  <text start="117.56" dur="6.179">ourselves from the euro and go back to</text>
  <text start="120.739" dur="4.261">the lira now of course this is not going</text>
  <text start="123.739" dur="2.58">to be easy they&amp;#39;re not going to be able</text>
  <text start="125" dur="2.58">to just do this with snap with their</text>
  <text start="126.319" dur="3.541">fingers they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="3.6">convince the entire country to do this</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="3.15">and this is why they&amp;#39;re collecting all</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="4.47">these signatures to bring it to the</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="4.56">government and say we have had enough we</text>
  <text start="135.65" dur="4.83">need to move out of this situation and</text>
  <text start="137.57" dur="3.39">we have to remember Italy right now the</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="2.34">you</text>
  <text start="140.96" dur="4.14">unemployment there is about forty six</text>
  <text start="142.82" dur="5.13">percent industrial production has fallen</text>
  <text start="145.1" dur="5.37">about twenty-five percent many note that</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="4.98">since joining the Euro Italy once an</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="5.22">industrial powerhouse of Europe has been</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="6.45">unable to compete with Germany due to an</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="6.63">overvalued currency also in Greece there</text>
  <text start="159.38" dur="5.07">is a increased calls from the people</text>
  <text start="162.32" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re saying we need to return to the</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="5.22">drachma polls show thirty-three percent</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="5.4">in favor of a return to the Greek</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="4.68">drachma at this time and we can see</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="3.84">right now these countries are looking at</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="4.14">the situation and saying we are not</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="5.37">seeing any type of growth actually the</text>
  <text start="178.49" dur="4.74">situation is getting worse and it is</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="5.79">getting worse it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="6.09">people are living in their cars living</text>
  <text start="187.1" dur="4.86">in the streets and there is no hope for</text>
  <text start="189.32" dur="4.8">any type of jobs or anything down the</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="3.6">line at this point and as we look down</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="2.91">the line we see things are just getting</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="3.36">worse and it&amp;#39;s really starting to spread</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="3.72">its spreading to Germany it&amp;#39;s spreading</text>
  <text start="198.92" dur="3.6">the UK and many other countries and</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="4.92">pretty soon we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="4.59">entire European Union in a major major</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="4.44">depression now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="4.98">what are we saying well we understand</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="4.47">the US government the federal reserve</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="5.31">they have their way of manipulating all</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="5.28">the calculations and and numbers to make</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="4.02">us believe that we are in a recovery of</text>
  <text start="219.86" dur="3.57">course they want all eyes on the stock</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="3.99">market and when the stock market comes</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="5.13">down they kind of lean in and say they</text>
  <text start="225.41" dur="5.73">kind of mentioned QE to drive it back up</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.58">and that&amp;#39;s exactly what the Fed did they</text>
  <text start="231.14" dur="5.4">mention the continuation of QE + QE 4</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="3.57">and all of a sudden the stock market</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="3.96">went up it looks like it was in the</text>
  <text start="237.71" dur="4.74">green today and of course the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="4.65">there saying that everything looks good</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re back on recovery track because the</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="4.29">stock market went back up and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="248" dur="3.18">they care about they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="3.87">all the other indicators and all the</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="3.9">data from the rest of the country all</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="3.69">they care about is the stock market</text>
  <text start="255.08" dur="3.36">keeping this up right now to make</text>
  <text start="257" dur="2.31">everyone believe we&amp;#39;re in a recovery but</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="3.41">when we look at the real economic</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="5.1">indicators we see things are completely</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="5.32">falling apart we see real estate falling</text>
  <text start="264.41" dur="5.04">apart retail in the dumps we see the</text>
  <text start="267.17" dur="3.6">unemployment is skyrocketing even though</text>
  <text start="269.45" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re telling us it&amp;#39;s five point nine</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="3.6">percent we know that&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="3.89">phony and false we all</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="6.51">so know that inflation is skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="7.599">in the supermarkets with food with meat</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="6.509">fresh produce anything that is fresh or</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="5.22">alcohol or meat we see prices</text>
  <text start="287.389" dur="4.471">continually going up other things that</text>
  <text start="289.639" dur="4.011">are boxed chemically altered we see</text>
  <text start="291.86" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re pretty much staying the same and</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="4.54">most of the products right now what</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re doing is shrinking them so no</text>
  <text start="298.19" dur="5.4">one is the wiser of what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="5.399">on but layoffs are continuing in the</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="4.47">United States and we see text on systems</text>
  <text start="306.229" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re laying off about 200 people next</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="5.91">month sprint and Kansas headquarters is</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="7.23">laying off about 450 to superior essex</text>
  <text start="313.97" dur="7.199">in north carolina about 119 BB&amp;amp;T 800</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="5.25">people and AMD about 700 people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="3.78">laying off so layoffs are continuing</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="3.36">people are going to be looking for jobs</text>
  <text start="324.949" dur="3.69">where are they going to find them we</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t know but again a lot of these</text>
  <text start="328.639" dur="3.661">people might be on severance so they</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="3.15">have some time and then they&amp;#39;ll go on</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="4.56">unemployment and then they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="4.23">looking for work and again throughout</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="2.61">this time they&amp;#39;ll be looking for work</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="3.179">anyhow and they&amp;#39;ll be sending out the</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="4.379">resume and what I&amp;#39;ve been seeing is that</text>
  <text start="341.419" dur="4.531">many of the people are not getting</text>
  <text start="343.849" dur="4.651">responses and a lot of the jobs have</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="4.17">turned into full-time jobs with full</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="4.169">benefits and everything like that to</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="4.38">consulting work and this is like a</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="5.851">part-time type of position because they</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="7.44">can let you go at any second now it</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="5.31">looks like the energy prices of oil they</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.92">are coming down so you see gas prices</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="4.83">coming down and the question is is this</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="5.25">something that the United States and</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="6.81">Saudi Arabia are doing together to hit</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="6.6">Russia lower oil prices reflected in</text>
  <text start="375.47" dur="5.58">falling petrol prices at the pump have</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="4.86">been a boon for Western consumers are</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="5.07">they also a potent us weapon against</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="5.19">Russia and Iran the US and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="4.829">whether by accident or design could be</text>
  <text start="388.76" dur="5.37">pumping Russia and Iran to bring of</text>
  <text start="390.949" dur="4.741">economic collapse and of course as we</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="3.81">know the United States and the European</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="4.59">Union and other countries place</text>
  <text start="397.94" dur="3.36">sanctions on Russia and of course they</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="2.879">thought that was going to devastate</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="5.06">their economy but really didn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="4.98">much all they did was channel all their</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="4.51">products and where they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="5.641">stuff from two different areas and they</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="4.229">separated themselves from the west where</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="3.81">they started to look at their own</text>
  <text start="415.099" dur="5.011">currency China&amp;#39;s currency and other</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="3.599">countries currencies to trade not using</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="3.619">the dollar they&amp;#39;re creating their own</text>
  <text start="421.189" dur="6.271">payment system so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="6.46">becoming independent now of the west and</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.169">it seems like right now the United</text>
  <text start="430.189" dur="3.84">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="431.629" dur="3.931">trying to use this to destroy the</text>
  <text start="434.029" dur="5.04">economy of Russian you have to remember</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="7.379">Russia has a huge amount of oil reserves</text>
  <text start="439.069" dur="5.671">and again their economy is manufacturing</text>
  <text start="442.939" dur="4.35">base they do have a lot of manufacturing</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="4.949">and despite the turmoil in many of the</text>
  <text start="447.289" dur="5.49">world&amp;#39;s oil producing countries Libya</text>
  <text start="449.689" dur="6.45">Iraq Nigeria and Syria prices are</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="5.461">hitting lows not seen in years and we</text>
  <text start="456.139" dur="4.411">can see right now that is it really</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="4.349">having an effect do they want it do they</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="4.679">want it to look like it&amp;#39;s having an</text>
  <text start="462.589" dur="5.371">effect to show that the sanctions are</text>
  <text start="465.229" dur="6.481">working and we&amp;#39;re not really seeing it</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="5.37">at this point and of course in the news</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="3.6">they keep saying the ruble is falling</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="3.269">but again that&amp;#39;s against the dollar if</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re not using the dollar and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.599" dur="4.5">using the you want ruble to make trades</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="3.779">and things like that I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="481.099" dur="3.78">much the other countries are concerned</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="3.571">with it or Russia is concerned with it</text>
  <text start="484.879" dur="3.54">at this point so we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="3.6">trying everything they possibly can but</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="5.73">here in the United States as oil prices</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="5.669">fall the fracking industry is really</text>
  <text start="494.149" dur="3.33">getting hit because the only way the</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="3.481">fracking industry was doing well is</text>
  <text start="497.479" dur="3.81">because prices were very high and that</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="4.41">made it cost effective to do fracking</text>
  <text start="501.289" dur="4.921">but as oil prices come down fracking is</text>
  <text start="503.87" dur="4.65">having a problem so it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="6.59">having another boomerang effect here in</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="9.209">the United States now as we know</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="6.76">Obamacare again is not a benefit for the</text>
  <text start="517.729" dur="4.531">people it is a benefit for the insurance</text>
  <text start="519.56" dur="3.93">companies and for the government and if</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="3">you want to hear more about this you can</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="3.089">go to my other reports and you can</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="4.8">listen to me but what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="526.579" dur="5.431">is that Obamacare is kind of hiding the</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="4.08">premiums at this point until after the</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="3.84">elections are saying it&amp;#39;s a glitch and</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ll get this fixed right after the</text>
  <text start="535.85" dur="4.59">elections but what I&amp;#39;m seeing right now</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="3.52">is he&amp;#39;s hiding it because he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="3.67">want anyone to realize</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="4.71">that the premiums have increased so much</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="7.29">that it would hurt the democratic</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="6.93">party&amp;#39;s election the elections in</text>
  <text start="551.4" dur="3.48">November so they&amp;#39;re keeping that hitting</text>
  <text start="553.59" dur="4.56">right now but right now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="554.88" dur="5.37">reports that the bronze plan are going</text>
  <text start="558.15" dur="4.11">to see about a fourteen percent increase</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="4.86">in Obamacare which is also the</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="4.41">Affordable Care Act and we can see right</text>
  <text start="565.11" dur="3.33">now they&amp;#39;re hiding this because they</text>
  <text start="566.67" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t want people to say wait a minute I</text>
  <text start="568.44" dur="4.2">thought this was affordable why does it</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="4.89">continually go up and why are our</text>
  <text start="572.64" dur="4.56">benefits continually going down because</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="4.32">as you pay more and you have a high</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.8">deductible you&amp;#39;re getting less and less</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="5.07">benefits but again this wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="582" dur="4.62">for the people because if it was guess</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="4.08">what our government officials would have</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="5.1">sat down in front of their computers and</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="5.73">live on television to show us how great</text>

  <text start="637.86" dur="4.29">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="639.21" dur="5.18">central bankers could care less about</text>
  <text start="642.15" dur="6.12">the people of the United States because</text>

  <text start="655.5" dur="6.03">inside of the United States first and</text>
  <text start="658.05" dur="5.97">say hmm what do we need to fix or help</text>
  <text start="661.53" dur="4.02">inside here and what do we need to spend</text>
  <text start="664.02" dur="2.73">money on let me see we have a lot of</text>

  <text start="710.04" dur="5.399">remove this government sometime coming</text>
  <text start="712.889" dur="4.38">soon we need to put something in there</text>
  <text start="715.439" dur="3.96">that says before the United States</text>
  <text start="717.269" dur="3.451">government central bankers well actually</text>
  <text start="719.399" dur="3.54">the central bankers should be gone</text>
  <text start="720.72" dur="5.19">before our government officials decide</text>

  <text start="725.91" dur="5.399">need to fix or help the people here</text>

  <text start="731.309" dur="4.411">go and help anyone else outside of the</text>

  <text start="745.769" dur="5.19">be seeing this here in the United States</text>
  <text start="747.899" dur="5.61">and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="750.959" dur="4.891">government the central bankers could</text>
  <text start="753.509" dur="3.541">care less about the people here in the</text>
  <text start="755.85" dur="4.109">United States and this is very evident</text>
  <text start="757.05" dur="6.659">not just with this but how they treat us</text>
  <text start="759.959" dur="6">with the rights and how they want to spy</text>

  <text start="782.129" dur="4.351">we can see that all of this is being</text>

  <text start="812.97" dur="4.229">generation comes up they will believe</text>
  <text start="814.649" dur="5.701">this and they&amp;#39;ll think this is where</text>
  <text start="817.199" dur="5.58">they have free speech only not wherever</text>
  <text start="820.35" dur="6.63">they want and this is a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="822.779" dur="7.59">this is what we&amp;#39;re fighting and speaking</text>
  <text start="826.98" dur="6.24">about spying it seems that James call me</text>
  <text start="830.369" dur="6.33">he is still out there and he wants to he</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="8.76">wants Congress to mandate back doors in</text>
  <text start="836.699" dur="7.86">all devices so he can surveil everybody</text>
  <text start="841.98" dur="4.289">in the country and trust them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="844.559" dur="4.02">only going to go after those people who</text>
  <text start="846.269" dur="5.04">they believe are terrorists or criminals</text>
  <text start="848.579" dur="5.31">and things like that well let me ask you</text>
  <text start="851.309" dur="8.01">this does everyone have a back door in</text>
  <text start="853.889" dur="8.461">their safe to allow the FBI NSA DHS into</text>
  <text start="859.319" dur="5.401">their safe in their home no you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="862.35" dur="3.929">you have a back door in your house where</text>
  <text start="864.72" dur="4.14">they can come in at any time in search</text>
  <text start="866.279" dur="5.1">your house without a warrant no you</text>
  <text start="868.86" dur="5.039">don&amp;#39;t guess what if they really want to</text>
  <text start="871.379" dur="4.5">go ahead and search something they have</text>
  <text start="873.899" dur="5.821">to present it in front of a judge with a</text>
  <text start="875.879" dur="5.25">warrant to get permission to spy on the</text>
  <text start="879.72" dur="3.51">people they do this with the phone</text>
  <text start="881.129" dur="4.26">system and he&amp;#39;s using this argument that</text>
  <text start="883.23" dur="4.289">oh they have back doors know they have</text>
  <text start="885.389" dur="4.92">to go to the phone company to tap into</text>
  <text start="887.519" dur="5.91">the system to use it and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="890.309" dur="4.95">to use the same argument but I hate to</text>
  <text start="893.429" dur="3.03">say this it&amp;#39;s a little different with</text>
  <text start="895.259" dur="3.57">the phone company because that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="896.459" dur="7.05">central location each individual device</text>
  <text start="898.829" dur="7.11">is separate and apart from the main</text>

  <text start="905.939" dur="4.921">device here and again they need a</text>
  <text start="908.759" dur="4.08">warrant this is why we have the Fourth</text>
  <text start="910.86" dur="4.019">Amendment if they&amp;#39;re really trying to</text>
  <text start="912.839" dur="4.05">track people down they have to make</text>
  <text start="914.879" dur="5.94">their case this is why our founding</text>
  <text start="916.889" dur="6.48">fathers put this in place now it looks</text>
  <text start="920.819" dur="5.55">like there was a poll taking and about</text>
  <text start="923.369" dur="5.75">sixty four percent say the events in the</text>
  <text start="926.369" dur="4.89">US are completely out of control an</text>
  <text start="929.119" dur="4.33">overwhelming majority of voters in the</text>
  <text start="931.259" dur="4.62">most competitive 2014 elections say it</text>
  <text start="933.449" dur="4.62">feels as if event in the united states</text>
  <text start="935.879" dur="5.07">are out of control and expressed</text>
  <text start="938.069" dur="4.411">mounting alarm about terrorism anxiety</text>
  <text start="940.949" dur="4.14">about Ebola</text>
  <text start="942.48" dur="5.4">about spying and about everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="945.089" dur="4.411">going on here and of course yes it is</text>
  <text start="947.88" dur="3.93">out of control because this is the way</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="4.32">the US government central bankers want</text>
  <text start="951.81" dur="5.43">it they want everyone confused out of</text>
  <text start="953.82" dur="5.34">control not feeling safe and don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="957.24" dur="4.289">the government&amp;#39;s here to protect you and</text>
  <text start="959.16" dur="3.57">again this is why everyone feels like</text>
  <text start="961.529" dur="3.391">this and I&amp;#39;ve been talking to other</text>
  <text start="962.73" dur="5.159">people right now and what I&amp;#39;m starting</text>
  <text start="964.92" dur="4.62">to realize is that people who listen to</text>
  <text start="967.889" dur="4.081">the corporate media don&amp;#39;t really listen</text>
  <text start="969.54" dur="5.28">to the independent media they&amp;#39;re feeling</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="6.27">that there&amp;#39;s something wrong something</text>
  <text start="974.82" dur="5.519">isn&amp;#39;t right they&amp;#39;re feeling that why are</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="5.07">we nervous and don&amp;#39;t feel safe anymore</text>
  <text start="980.339" dur="5.221">and the government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="4.17">doing this on purpose because again</text>
  <text start="985.56" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re planning for something very very</text>
  <text start="987.48" dur="4.859">big to occur because they want all eyes</text>
  <text start="990.06" dur="4.2">off of them and on to another group or</text>
  <text start="992.339" dur="4.171">country and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="994.26" dur="4.41">built building and everyday people who</text>
  <text start="996.51" dur="4.65">really don&amp;#39;t pay attention their gut is</text>
  <text start="998.67" dur="4.529">telling them something they feel it in</text>
  <text start="1001.16" dur="4.919">the air and they&amp;#39;re starting to wake up</text>
  <text start="1003.199" dur="4.591">to this not everybody but some people</text>
  <text start="1006.079" dur="6.24">that I&amp;#39;ve been talking to are really</text>
  <text start="1007.79" dur="10.109">starting to feel this now in Nigeria we</text>
  <text start="1012.319" dur="7.591">see that Ebola is pretty much out of</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="5.19">this country at this point in time</text>
  <text start="1019.91" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re saying Nigeria is ebola-free and</text>
  <text start="1023.089" dur="4.441">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="4.74">back but closing the Borders containing</text>
  <text start="1027.53" dur="3.899">it the same thing happened in Senegal so</text>
  <text start="1029.6" dur="4.05">we have two countries here that pretty</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="4.291">much closed off their borders contain</text>
  <text start="1033.65" dur="4.11">the situation and they were able to get</text>
  <text start="1035.72" dur="4.17">rid of Ebola and of course as we know</text>
  <text start="1037.76" dur="4.86">Obama doesn&amp;#39;t want to close the borders</text>
  <text start="1039.89" dur="4.919">because that orb and flights because</text>
  <text start="1042.62" dur="4.589">that just wouldn&amp;#39;t work but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1044.809" dur="4.5">it work in many many other areas and of</text>
  <text start="1047.209" dur="4.35">course the question is why doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="1049.309" dur="4.021">want to do this there&amp;#39;s another agenda</text>
  <text start="1051.559" dur="5.401">and of course as we know in Liberia</text>
  <text start="1053.33" dur="5.729">bidding is open for those oil deposits</text>
  <text start="1056.96" dur="4.11">and again he doesn&amp;#39;t want to keep</text>
  <text start="1059.059" dur="4.261">business people or other people going to</text>
  <text start="1061.07" dur="4.859">that area because United States central</text>
  <text start="1063.32" dur="3.989">bankers want that entire area they want</text>
  <text start="1065.929" dur="4.221">to capture it they want to put it on the</text>
  <text start="1067.309" dur="5.191">US dollar and we can see this is another</text>
  <text start="1070.15" dur="3.909">agenda that&amp;#39;s being done here and this</text>
  <text start="1072.5" dur="3.48">is why he does want to close anything</text>
  <text start="1074.059" dur="3.901">and it looks like UK</text>
  <text start="1075.98" dur="4.26">troops are going to be sent to Sierra</text>
  <text start="1077.96" dur="4.68">Leone to enforce a military lockdown</text>
  <text start="1080.24" dur="4.26">under radical plan to defeat Ebola and</text>
  <text start="1082.64" dur="3.24">what I find about this and what I find</text>
  <text start="1084.5" dur="2.549">about very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="1085.88" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;re going to be sending about</text>
  <text start="1087.049" dur="5.731">3,000 soldiers to this area but Syria</text>
  <text start="1089.99" dur="4.47">Leone went out of their way to ask for</text>
  <text start="1092.78" dur="4.47">Russia to come in and Russia was going</text>
  <text start="1094.46" dur="4.29">to send biologists and other doctors and</text>
  <text start="1097.25" dur="3.78">things like that it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1098.75" dur="4.53">that the UK is deciding to send in</text>
  <text start="1101.03" dur="4.5">troops into this area just like the</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="4.11">United States has sent troops into these</text>
  <text start="1105.53" dur="4.68">areas and of course what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1107.39" dur="4.95">to do is pretty much take over these</text>
  <text start="1110.21" dur="4.23">countries it seems like it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1112.34" dur="4.11">a backdoor coup and it seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="4.109">starting to really build now and it</text>
  <text start="1116.45" dur="4.32">looks like they&amp;#39;re using Ebola to get</text>
  <text start="1118.549" dur="6.63">the military operation inside of these</text>
  <text start="1120.77" dur="5.82">countries now as we know at least this</text>
  <text start="1125.179" dur="3.99">is what they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="1126.59" dur="4.26">there is no way and no good test to</text>
  <text start="1129.169" dur="6.361">detect Ebola but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1130.85" dur="7.079">is that there is a in a bolus screening</text>
  <text start="1135.53" dur="5.43">machine it is currently available to the</text>
  <text start="1137.929" dur="6.091">US military and the military is using it</text>
  <text start="1140.96" dur="5.16">now so why aren&amp;#39;t US hospitals using it</text>
  <text start="1144.02" dur="5.94">because government guidelines prevent</text>
  <text start="1146.12" dur="6.84">hospitals from doing so it&amp;#39;s a toaster</text>
  <text start="1149.96" dur="5.67">sized box called film array produced by</text>
  <text start="1152.96" dur="4.77">a company called bio fire it&amp;#39;s capable</text>
  <text start="1155.63" dur="5.22">of detecting Ebola with a high degree of</text>
  <text start="1157.73" dur="5.61">confidence in under an hour incredibly</text>
  <text start="1160.85" dur="5.19">it was present at Dallas Presbyterian</text>
  <text start="1163.34" dur="4.23">Hospital when Ebola patient Terry Thomas</text>
  <text start="1166.04" dur="3.48">Eric Duncan walked through the door</text>
  <text start="1167.57" dur="4.62">complaining of a fever and he had just</text>
  <text start="1169.52" dur="4.95">come from Liberia Duncan was then sent</text>
  <text start="1172.19" dur="4.47">home as we know and of course he was not</text>
  <text start="1174.47" dur="4.11">giving any type of test using this</text>

  <text start="1460.43" dur="5.7">have it at this time now in Liberia</text>
  <text start="1463.82" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1493.659" dur="4.65">slow down a little bit and it seems like</text>
  <text start="1495.34" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s flat line right now and now we see</text>
  <text start="1498.309" dur="3.301">of course troops from the UK coming in</text>
  <text start="1500.32" dur="3.239">we also have the United States troops</text>
  <text start="1501.61" dur="3.36">coming in and it&amp;#39;s starting to seem like</text>
  <text start="1503.559" dur="5.1">things are starting to slow down a</text>
  <text start="1504.97" dur="6.569">little bit and they&amp;#39;re not as a as bad</text>

  <text start="1511.539" dur="2.941">couple weeks ago and here in the United</text>
  <text start="1513.039" dur="3.181">States we&amp;#39;re seeing all these cases that</text>
  <text start="1514.48" dur="3.689">are flashing up all turning out to be</text>

  <text start="1523.269" dur="3.78">this thing is spreading out of control</text>
  <text start="1525.1" dur="4.019">right now but we&amp;#39;ll have to keep a watch</text>
  <text start="1527.049" dur="3.391">on it and see what&amp;#39;s going on and of</text>
  <text start="1529.119" dur="3.991">course everyone still has to take</text>
  <text start="1530.44" dur="5.78">precautions just in case this whole</text>
  <text start="1533.11" dur="6.87">thing just goes completely crazy here</text>
  <text start="1536.22" dur="6.459">now in regards to MH 17 it looks like</text>
  <text start="1539.98" dur="4.409">Germany has released their intelligence</text>
  <text start="1542.679" dur="4.021">report saying that now Russia had</text>
  <text start="1544.389" dur="6.091">nothing to do with the shooting down of</text>
  <text start="1546.7" dur="5.52">the mh17 plane but they&amp;#39;re trying to pin</text>
  <text start="1550.48" dur="4.199">this on the pro-russian the south</text>
  <text start="1552.22" dur="4.559">eastern people saying they stole a book</text>
  <text start="1554.679" dur="4.651">missile system and they used it but</text>
  <text start="1556.779" dur="4.051">again what would be their motivation to</text>
  <text start="1559.33" dur="3.66">do this why would they shoot down this</text>
  <text start="1560.83" dur="6.449">plane and we have to think back and</text>
  <text start="1562.99" dur="6.99">remember that Ukraine had control of the</text>
  <text start="1567.279" dur="4.86">air traffic control they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="1569.98" dur="4.319">directed the plane over this area all</text>
  <text start="1572.139" dur="6.51">other planes were flying around it they</text>
  <text start="1574.299" dur="7.171">told them what where to go how high to</text>
  <text start="1578.649" dur="5.541">fly we also understand there&amp;#39;s a there</text>
  <text start="1581.47" dur="6.12">was a military airplane right behind</text>
  <text start="1584.19" dur="6.459">mh17 the Dutch investigators said yes</text>
  <text start="1587.59" dur="5.219">there were shots fired into the plane so</text>
  <text start="1590.649" dur="3.87">right now Germany is putting this</text>
  <text start="1592.809" dur="3.75">information out here and it seems like</text>
  <text start="1594.519" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re doing everything possible to</text>
  <text start="1596.559" dur="4.56">confuse the situation basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1599.529" dur="4.411">going to happen is this good this is</text>
  <text start="1601.119" dur="4.05">going to pretty much go back to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1603.94" dur="3.209">saying that they are completely</text>
  <text start="1605.169" dur="3.75">responsible you have to remember to use</text>
  <text start="1607.149" dur="3.351">these buk missile system it takes</text>
  <text start="1608.919" dur="3.891">training it&amp;#39;s not just one person</text>
  <text start="1610.5" dur="4.14">it takes more than one person to use it</text>
  <text start="1612.81" dur="4.26">it takes training and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1614.64" dur="4.5">trying to make it like they stole one of</text>
  <text start="1617.07" dur="4.26">the missile systems and they just so</text>
  <text start="1619.14" dur="4.26">happen to use it and hit the plane down</text>
  <text start="1621.33" dur="3.12">and this is absolutely ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="1623.4" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re trying to confuse the situation</text>
  <text start="1624.45" dur="8.58">at this time now there were reports that</text>
  <text start="1628.23" dur="9.72">a Russian sub pretty much mysteriously</text>
  <text start="1633.03" dur="6.45">appeared off of Sweden and right now we</text>
  <text start="1637.95" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t really know if it&amp;#39;s Russian that</text>
  <text start="1639.48" dur="4.2">they were someone who took photographs</text>
  <text start="1640.92" dur="5.34">and they were going off of that and it</text>
  <text start="1643.68" dur="5.67">seems like the Swedish real Rear Admiral</text>
  <text start="1646.26" dur="5.28">Anders told reporters that the search</text>
  <text start="1649.35" dur="4.44">was prompted by a photo sent to the</text>

  <text start="1667.05" dur="4.95">Stockholm coast at the time of the first</text>

  <text start="1672" dur="5.37">submarine or any other submarine we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1674.31" dur="4.68">not sure but of course the propagandists</text>
  <text start="1677.37" dur="4.62">are out there just saying yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1678.99" dur="5.87">Russia it&amp;#39;s Russia it&amp;#39;s Russia now it</text>
  <text start="1681.99" dur="5.97">seems like there was a huge explosion in</text>
  <text start="1684.86" dur="4.78">Donetsk at a chemical factory and right</text>
  <text start="1687.96" dur="3.86">now they&amp;#39;re looking at into it they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1695.22" dur="3.96">factory they&amp;#39;re not saying this for sure</text>
  <text start="1697.32" dur="4.23">and again this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="1699.18" dur="3.99">Ukrainian side and I do believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1701.55" dur="4.74">going to try everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="1703.17" dur="5.88">can to reignite this war they want it to</text>

  <text start="1750.29" dur="4.38">see already that this is going to flare</text>
  <text start="1752.57" dur="6.78">up once again and we&amp;#39;re heading down</text>
  <text start="1754.67" dur="7.08">that way now it looks like Obama is</text>
  <text start="1759.35" dur="4.77">going to try to bypass Congress once</text>
  <text start="1761.75" dur="4.11">again he has a paper he has a pen and</text>
  <text start="1764.12" dur="4.77">the US President Barack Obama will do</text>
  <text start="1765.86" dur="5.43">everything in his power to avoid a vote</text>
  <text start="1768.89" dur="4.77">in Congress on any nuclear accord with</text>
  <text start="1771.29" dur="4.17">Iran according to a new report in a</text>
  <text start="1773.66" dur="3.57">detailed and classified study the US</text>
  <text start="1775.46" dur="4.23">Treasury Department has concluded that</text>
  <text start="1777.23" dur="4.62">the president has the authority to</text>
  <text start="1779.69" dur="5.64">suspend the vast majority of those</text>
  <text start="1781.85" dur="5.82">sanctions without congressional vote but</text>
  <text start="1785.33" dur="4.14">in truth Obama needs congressional</text>
  <text start="1787.67" dur="3.72">approval before being able to</text>
  <text start="1789.47" dur="4.47">permanently terminate the sanctions</text>
  <text start="1791.39" dur="4.83">something to rant insists should happen</text>
  <text start="1793.94" dur="5.01">as part of the comprehensive deal and of</text>
  <text start="1796.22" dur="6.96">course Obama loves to bypass Congress</text>
  <text start="1798.95" dur="8.16">and do things on his own now it seems</text>
  <text start="1803.18" dur="6.03">like France Italy Germany the United</text>
  <text start="1807.11" dur="3.84">Kingdom the United States have released</text>
  <text start="1809.21" dur="4.71">a statement threatening sanctions</text>
  <text start="1810.95" dur="4.59">against Libya now we understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1813.92" dur="3.84">happening in the Middle East here the</text>
  <text start="1815.54" dur="5.01">people are rising up in Yemen Libya</text>
  <text start="1817.76" dur="5.1">Lebanon and Iraq they are taking back</text>
  <text start="1820.55" dur="4.47">their countries Libya has pushed out</text>
  <text start="1822.86" dur="4.14">their Parliament and there are</text>
  <text start="1825.02" dur="3.93">government and they&amp;#39;ve taken over the</text>
  <text start="1827" dur="4.32">country right now and of course now the</text>
  <text start="1828.95" dur="5.16">central bankers are starting to wake up</text>
  <text start="1831.32" dur="5.28">and say whoa whoa whoa now this has gone</text>
  <text start="1834.11" dur="4.92">too far and we can see they are now</text>
  <text start="1836.6" dur="3.45">moving to do something now of course how</text>
  <text start="1839.03" dur="2.67">are they going to get back into this</text>
  <text start="1840.05" dur="3.5">country we&amp;#39;ve already seen signs of the</text>
  <text start="1841.7" dur="4.17">Islamic state inside the country and</text>
  <text start="1843.55" dur="4.9">eventually they will go back into this</text>
  <text start="1845.87" dur="4.17">country but at the at this time they</text>
  <text start="1848.45" dur="5.04">decide that they&amp;#39;re going to be placing</text>
  <text start="1850.04" dur="6.06">sanctions on certain government people</text>
  <text start="1853.49" dur="4.2">where of course the people there created</text>
  <text start="1856.1" dur="2.88">their own government the statement</text>
  <text start="1857.69" dur="4.11">further warned that the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1858.98" dur="6.15">stand ready to use individual sanctions</text>
  <text start="1861.8" dur="5.31">in accordance with the UNSCR 2174</text>
  <text start="1865.13" dur="4.83">against those who threaten the peace</text>
  <text start="1867.11" dur="4.62">stability of security of Libya so</text>
  <text start="1869.96" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re getting a little nervous now and</text>
  <text start="1871.73" dur="4.62">what are their methods they use</text>
  <text start="1873.86" dur="3.96">sanctions of course if they don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="1876.35" dur="4.53">the dollar</text>
  <text start="1877.82" dur="5.1">and they use you want ruble gold and</text>
  <text start="1880.88" dur="4.86">they bypass this completely they can go</text>
  <text start="1882.92" dur="4.98">out and sell this oil not using it Iran</text>
  <text start="1885.74" dur="4.38">has done it for years cubit has done it</text>
  <text start="1887.9" dur="5.4">for years and what we&amp;#39;re going to see is</text>
  <text start="1890.12" dur="4.95">something occur if they try to do this</text>
  <text start="1893.3" dur="3.45">and now you can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1895.07" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re trying everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="1896.75" dur="5.94">can to stop the sale of oil because if</text>
  <text start="1900.5" dur="3.83">they don&amp;#39;t use the US dollar this is</text>
  <text start="1902.69" dur="4.5">going to may have major implications</text>
  <text start="1904.33" dur="5.5">around the world and especially here in</text>
  <text start="1907.19" dur="4.98">the United States now of course the</text>
  <text start="1909.83" dur="4.47">parliament of Libya the government of</text>
  <text start="1912.17" dur="4.77">Libya that&amp;#39;s been pushed out is now</text>
  <text start="1914.3" dur="5.55">joining forces with the rogue general</text>
  <text start="1916.94" dur="4.2">which is a CIA operative who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1919.85" dur="4.08">running around trying to maintain</text>
  <text start="1921.14" dur="4.32">control of the country but has lost out</text>
  <text start="1923.93" dur="3.96">and it didn&amp;#39;t do what they thought it</text>
  <text start="1925.46" dur="4.14">was going to do and now the government</text>
  <text start="1927.89" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s pushed out is joining with the</text>
  <text start="1929.6" dur="5.22">rogue general trying to retake Libya so</text>
  <text start="1933.11" dur="3.99">we have the sanctions we have the road</text>
  <text start="1934.82" dur="6.39">general where they&amp;#39;re trying everything</text>
  <text start="1937.1" dur="8.31">they possibly can to take control of the</text>
  <text start="1941.21" dur="6.33">country now it seems like all the</text>
  <text start="1945.41" dur="4.14">humanitarian aid that is being dropped</text>
  <text start="1947.54" dur="4.32">for the Syrian people those people that</text>
  <text start="1949.55" dur="4.68">are displaced from their home towns that</text>
  <text start="1951.86" dur="4.26">are hungry it seems like it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1954.23" dur="4.14">the Islamic state now I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1956.12" dur="3.99">this because Russia&amp;#39;s been bringing in</text>
  <text start="1958.37" dur="3.66">humanitarian aid and it seems to get to</text>
  <text start="1960.11" dur="3.87">the Syrian people but when the United</text>
  <text start="1962.03" dur="4.65">States does it it seems to fall into the</text>
  <text start="1963.98" dur="4.2">hands of the Islamic state and again we</text>
  <text start="1966.68" dur="4.38">understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="1968.18" dur="5.79">central bankers really don&amp;#39;t care who</text>
  <text start="1971.06" dur="4.65">they kill in Syria or in Iraq they</text>
  <text start="1973.97" dur="3.57">really don&amp;#39;t care they don&amp;#39;t care if the</text>
  <text start="1975.71" dur="3.84">humanitarian aid actually reaches them</text>
  <text start="1977.54" dur="4.05">actually most likely that this</text>
  <text start="1979.55" dur="3.78">humanitarian aid was meant for the</text>
  <text start="1981.59" dur="3.57">Islamic state even though they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1983.33" dur="3.66">the propaganda it was meant for the</text>
  <text start="1985.16" dur="7.11">people and the Islamic state swooped in</text>
  <text start="1986.99" dur="7.89">and took it from them now as we know the</text>
  <text start="1992.27" dur="5.31">Islamic state which is the proxy Omri</text>
  <text start="1994.88" dur="4.95">for the United States UK Israel and</text>
  <text start="1997.58" dur="4.95">other Arab nations has been running</text>
  <text start="1999.83" dur="4.32">rampant through Syria and Iraq and of</text>
  <text start="2002.53" dur="4.02">course this is exactly what they want</text>
  <text start="2004.15" dur="3.84">they want complete chaos and during this</text>
  <text start="2006.55" dur="2.91">whole time where they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="2007.99" dur="3.309">terrorism of course they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2009.46" dur="3.459">including the country where their fight</text>
  <text start="2011.299" dur="4.71">it and they&amp;#39;re not including Iran Russia</text>
  <text start="2012.919" dur="5.7">or China the EU decides to put more</text>
  <text start="2016.009" dur="5.431">sanctions on Syria during this period of</text>
  <text start="2018.619" dur="5.37">time adding 16 names and two identities</text>
  <text start="2021.44" dur="5.069">to the blacklist another source said the</text>
  <text start="2023.989" dur="5.19">changes were made to include recently</text>
  <text start="2026.509" dur="5.071">appointed Syrian officials the EU also</text>
  <text start="2029.179" dur="5.401">maintains an oil embargo on Syria and</text>
  <text start="2031.58" dur="5.37">curbs on financial transactions this is</text>
  <text start="2034.58" dur="4.289">a different way of fighting terrorism</text>
  <text start="2036.95" dur="4.709">and of course they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="2038.869" dur="5.43">purpose because as you know the endgame</text>
  <text start="2041.659" dur="5.64">is to go after Assad and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="2044.299" dur="5.911">what they&amp;#39;re doing of course to using</text>
  <text start="2047.299" dur="6.84">the propaganda that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="2050.21" dur="6.56">going to use these newly acquired</text>
  <text start="2054.139" dur="4.92">chemical weapons that they found in Iraq</text>
  <text start="2056.77" dur="5.139">they&amp;#39;re saying that they have found</text>
  <text start="2059.059" dur="5.76">about 2,500 rockets containing the</text>
  <text start="2061.909" dur="7.381">deadly nerve gas sarin and they might</text>
  <text start="2064.819" dur="6.211">use this on Syria or in Iraq and of</text>
  <text start="2069.29" dur="3.24">course this is again propaganda we</text>
  <text start="2071.03" dur="5.19">understand these chemical weapons are</text>
  <text start="2072.53" dur="6.149">very volatile inside of Iraq anyone that</text>
  <text start="2076.22" dur="4.829">comes in contact with them is then</text>
  <text start="2078.679" dur="4.89">infected by the gas and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2081.049" dur="6.6">have a very tough time using it at this</text>
  <text start="2083.569" dur="6.03">time now what we&amp;#39;re seeing we had</text>
  <text start="2087.649" dur="6.091">propaganda out there that Syria was</text>
  <text start="2089.599" dur="5.881">creating their own not Syria the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2093.74" dur="3.78">state was creating their own Air Force</text>
  <text start="2095.48" dur="4.02">they were getting training and now there</text>
  <text start="2097.52" dur="4.95">are reports out there saying that yes</text>
  <text start="2099.5" dur="5.73">they are forming an Air Force not just</text>
  <text start="2102.47" dur="4.079">with jets but with choppers too and</text>
  <text start="2105.23" dur="2.849">they&amp;#39;re getting all the proper training</text>
  <text start="2106.549" dur="4.56">and where did they get all this</text>
  <text start="2108.079" dur="6.601">equipment in Aleppo and in Rocca and</text>
  <text start="2111.109" dur="6.391">Deir al-zor where all the military bases</text>
  <text start="2114.68" dur="4.83">are the air the airports and of course</text>
  <text start="2117.5" dur="5.28">what we&amp;#39;re going to see right now is the</text>
  <text start="2119.51" dur="6.75">United States central bankers and Turkey</text>
  <text start="2122.78" dur="5.4">and Israel and UK and other Arab nations</text>
  <text start="2126.26" dur="4.2">are going to create this no-fly zone and</text>
  <text start="2128.18" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ll start destroying the air bases</text>
  <text start="2130.46" dur="6.33">in these regions because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2132.38" dur="6">Syria to retake them and use them at a</text>
  <text start="2136.79" dur="6.48">later date and we can see how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2138.38" dur="6.75">slowly creeping using mission creep to</text>
  <text start="2143.27" dur="3.509">do this because you can see</text>
  <text start="2145.13" dur="3.27">every day there&amp;#39;s a new report that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2146.779" dur="4.471">coming out and they&amp;#39;re slowly</text>
  <text start="2148.4" dur="4.469">maneuvering and setting it up so they</text>
  <text start="2151.25" dur="4.319">can create the no-fly zone and</text>
  <text start="2152.869" dur="5.071">eventually go after Assad now the</text>
  <text start="2155.569" dur="4.74">Pentagon is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="2157.94" dur="4.589">saying that they&amp;#39;re not sure if they</text>
  <text start="2160.309" dur="4.171">actually disord destroy the course on</text>
  <text start="2162.529" dur="3.48">terror group they might hit them a</text>
  <text start="2164.48" dur="3.389">little bit but it looks like the</text>
  <text start="2166.009" dur="4.26">imminent threat is still imminent and</text>
  <text start="2167.869" dur="4.621">they still might attack the United</text>
  <text start="2170.269" dur="4.56">States top military officials still</text>
  <text start="2172.49" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t know if last month airstrike</text>
  <text start="2174.829" dur="4.861">stopped the imminent threat of terrorist</text>
  <text start="2177.14" dur="4.889">attacks posed by the Khorasan group now</text>
  <text start="2179.69" dur="4.649">as we know under the UN Charter if there</text>
  <text start="2182.029" dur="4.32">is an imminent threat you can go in and</text>
  <text start="2184.339" dur="4.95">bomb in certain areas and this is</text>
  <text start="2186.349" dur="5.791">exactly what they use to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="2189.289" dur="4.951">they&amp;#39;re using this to their benefit they</text>
  <text start="2192.14" dur="3.54">had absolutely no proof whatsoever this</text>
  <text start="2194.24" dur="3.599">is the first time that anyone has ever</text>
  <text start="2195.68" dur="4.05">heard of course on and of course this is</text>
  <text start="2197.839" dur="4.111">completely made up just like the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2199.73" dur="5.129">state was created from absolutely</text>
  <text start="2201.95" dur="5.909">nothing and we can see this is all being</text>
  <text start="2204.859" dur="5.16">done and prepared to go after Assad and</text>
  <text start="2207.859" dur="3.631">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is we</text>
  <text start="2210.019" dur="3.84">are definitely going to see some type of</text>
  <text start="2211.49" dur="4.71">false flag event to bring this whole</text>
  <text start="2213.859" dur="5.521">thing home because they need to blame</text>
  <text start="2216.2" dur="5.069">this entire collapse that is coming and</text>
  <text start="2219.38" dur="4.53">you can see it the market is barely</text>
