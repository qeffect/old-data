  <text start="90.119" dur="5.521">and what we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="5.761">the british people are going to these</text>

  <text start="115.95" dur="4.11">mortgage or their rent and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="4.229">saying that this is just getting worse</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="7.199">and they&amp;#39;re getting calls into the</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="7.231">shelter centres and the charity centres</text>
  <text start="127.259" dur="7.051">saying that people are having a very</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="9.41">rough time making ends meet now here in</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="6.99">the US and in Europe we had a report and</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.44">I reported on this</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="6.27">I don&amp;#39;t know six or several reports back</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="5.97">where Ford said the sales of their cars</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="5.91">are not going well in the European</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="4.95">nation and in US and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="3.84">understand why like what why is this</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="3.57">happening and they and they eventually</text>
  <text start="157.32" dur="4.14">said well maybe it could be something</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="6.66">with economic or you know the people out</text>
  <text start="161.46" dur="7.17">in Europe not having work and it comes</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="5.1">down to this today Ford said they are</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="6.57">losing money in the European business</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="6.42">the sales fell around 2.1 percent and of</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="4.77">course we all know why this is this is</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="6.57">not rocket science I mean think about</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="8.81">this unemployment in Greece Cyprus</text>
  <text start="183.69" dur="7.89">France Portugal Italy Spain are you know</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="4.99">12% fifteen percent twenty percent</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="4.56">thirty percent depending on which</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="5.85">country and the overall eurozone</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="6.39">unemployment is 12.2 percent so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.4">think about this this is very high</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="5.19">unemployment people are having a tough</text>
  <text start="205.02" dur="5.219">time making ends meet even in the UK</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="3.75">people are taking payday loans out to</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="3.511">pay their rent mortgage they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="4.82">thinking let&amp;#39;s go get a new car so of</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="4.83">course the sales are going to fall and</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="4.06">they were wondering like why is this</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="4.26">happening in the US the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.35" dur="5.01">up really high well it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="5.34">problem the only difference is these</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="4.89">government and the Fed are manipulating</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="4.29">the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.89">them since 1994 and of course when</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="4.86">things don&amp;#39;t go their way they go ahead</text>
  <text start="235.14" dur="4.02">and they manipulate the statistical</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="3.99">calculation of how they come up with</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="3.57">these numbers they did it with GDP they</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="5.13">went all the way back to nineteen twenty</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="7.259">nine and they recalculated GDP adding in</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="5.37">research and development to make gdp in</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="4.711">a positive light and now we have been</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="4.68">having gdp in the positive light but if</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.159">you look at shadow stats calm and you</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="6.36">look at what GDP actually is it is in</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="5.431">the negative region and right now in</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="4.71">America Ford is looking to lay off</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="6.09">around nine hundred or more people in</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="5.4">the Ohio assembly plant and again during</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="3.06">this holiday season the auto</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="4.38">manufacturers channel</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="4.89">stuffed all the car dealerships to make</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="4.71">it seem like they were producing a lot</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.46">of cars but all these dealerships had</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="5.25">around 76 to 80 days worth of inventory</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="3.9">and you know they&amp;#39;re stuck with it</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re hoping oh maybe they&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="3.45">Christmas season will be able to sell it</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="4.17">but guess what they didn&amp;#39;t and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="4.26">still holding on to it the same thing</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="6.24">happened in the retail arena they</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="7.11">channel stuff all the retail the</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.22">retailers and again christmas sales what</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="5.52">they it was it the holiday season was a</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="5.52">disaster even though the fed the the US</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="3.84">government liked the you know spin it</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.53">changed their numbers and they made it</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="4.95">seem like Christmas wasn&amp;#39;t that bad but</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="4.14">if Christmas wasn&amp;#39;t that bad how come in</text>
  <text start="317.82" dur="3.48">my last report I reported on all the</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="4.35">sales declining in all the different</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.56">stores and right after the Christmas</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.05">season we saw a Macy&amp;#39;s laying off what</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="5.19">was it like 2500 people closing five</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="7.34">stores well guess what JC Penney is</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="8.04">firing around 2,000 people and closing</text>
  <text start="335.45" dur="5.86">333 stores anyone really surprised that</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.71">this I mean JC Penney was having a tough</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="4.41">time anyhow but if the retail season was</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="4.47">so great it would have pumped them up</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="4.68">but guess what it didn&amp;#39;t and you think</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="4.02">this is bad wait until you see the rest</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s going to come down the pike we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.29" dur="4.23">going to see many many stores closing</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="4.65">some that have been around for a long</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.45">time will no longer be with us Sears</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="5.609">right now in Canada they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="361.97" dur="4.66">1,600 people what do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="6.351">going to do in the US because guess what</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="7.73">sales in the US were much much worse</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="5.95">than in Canada and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="5.65">definitely stores closing kmart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.22" dur="5.699">closing and people laid off because the</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="6.5">holiday season was a bust because what</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="7.561">we have here in the US is people not</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="6.79">working if people aren&amp;#39;t working and</text>
  <text start="390.48" dur="4.95">cannot find jobs and if we use the</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="3.9">calculation prior to nineteen</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="5.4">ninety-four we see the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="6.27">between 25 and 30 percent people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="3.899">make it and of course they&amp;#39;re counting</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="3.15">all those people who are underemployed</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="2.791">where had they had a full-time job</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="2.97">making a nice</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="4.739">now they have maybe one two three</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="6.06">part-time jobs or a full-time job making</text>
  <text start="412.259" dur="6.451">less money again they are only buying</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="7.53">the things that they need that is it now</text>
  <text start="418.71" dur="8.669">in San Francisco the home sales plunged</text>
  <text start="423.18" dur="7.38">to a six-year low homes in San Francisco</text>
  <text start="427.379" dur="7.021">fell by twelve point seven percent in</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="6.139">December versus a year ago now we have</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="5.13">to remember back to a year ago</text>
  <text start="436.699" dur="7.571">unemployment was higher now it&amp;#39;s lower</text>
  <text start="439.53" dur="7.319">so again things aren&amp;#39;t making sense they</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t jive with the US government and</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="5.91">the Fed numbers they just it they just</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="6.87">can&amp;#39;t fit within each other it just</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="7.53">makes no sense now in my other report I</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="6.81">talked about the Baltic Dry Index and</text>
  <text start="460.289" dur="5.821">how when this drops it is an indicator</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="6.809">that things are going really really bad</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="7.2">and prior right during 2008 the Baltic</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="4.891">Dry Index dropped around I think was</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="4.65">ninety-three percent and here we are</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="6.21">that the Baltic Dry Index collapsed</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="9.09">around forty percent right now and this</text>
  <text start="481.77" dur="8.61">is a the worst start in a year in over</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="5.459">30 years right at this time nine days in</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="5.52">a row of plunging prices is yet another</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="6.121">canary in the global trade coal mine</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="6.199">there are problems that are going to</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="6.509">arise things are not what they seem and</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="6.011">certain indicators are letting us know</text>
  <text start="505.139" dur="6.75">this even Bob Shiller is warning that we</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="4.95">are in for a big big problem Joseph I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="511.889" dur="4.08">going to try to pronounce his last name</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="6.419">right here guy Rocco of the Wharton</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="6.151">School of Business created a 2013 study</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="5.461">and cook and he concluded that the FHA</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="4.95">now effectively leverage 32 one on</text>
  <text start="524.94" dur="4.769">guarantees of home mortgages that are</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="5.79">there that are them themselves leverage</text>
  <text start="529.709" dur="6.421">32 one is underwater to the tune of tens</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="7.65">of billions of dollars the housing</text>
  <text start="536.13" dur="5.22">market is in a huge amount of trouble we</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="3.99">are heading</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="5.16">down the same path we did prior to two</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="4.16">thousand eight and how do we know that</text>
  <text start="546.51" dur="4.38">is happening because now they are giving</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="4.54">financing which is a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="550.89" dur="4.5">financing they&amp;#39;re not checking your</text>
  <text start="553.2" dur="5.55">credit they are even going back to</text>
  <text start="555.39" dur="5.37">adjustable rate mortgages because the</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="4.44">interest rates are going up which is</text>
  <text start="560.76" dur="4.17">pushing people out of the market so what</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="3.63">do they need to do they have to give you</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="3.81">the adjustable rate mortgage so the</text>
  <text start="566.82" dur="4.74">interest rates are lower people are</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="5.4">going to go in on this just to get their</text>
  <text start="571.56" dur="8.61">home and eventually when interest rates</text>
  <text start="574.14" dur="8.07">go up and the arms expire they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="3.54">to have to pay the higher rate and guess</text>
  <text start="582.21" dur="3.18">what we&amp;#39;re going to have the same thing</text>
  <text start="583.71" dur="4.59">that happened in California when this</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="4.14">occurred and people just left their</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="3.39">house they left all the furniture in</text>
  <text start="589.53" dur="4.14">there they just walked out and there</text>
  <text start="591.69" dur="4.92">were thousands upon thousands of homes</text>
  <text start="593.67" dur="4.71">at that that were just completely empty</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="6.75">and we are going to see the same thing</text>
  <text start="598.38" dur="7.08">happen again now I talked about how they</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="3.75">like to change the numbers because when</text>
  <text start="605.46" dur="3.56">things aren&amp;#39;t going their way and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="607.11" dur="4.35">talking about the Fed and the government</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="4.42">unemployment&amp;#39;s not going their way GDP</text>
  <text start="611.46" dur="3.3">is not going the way they usually what</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="2.94">they do is they make up a new</text>
  <text start="614.76" dur="4.2">calculation and they say we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="616.38" dur="5.67">change it well this is happening right</text>
  <text start="618.96" dur="6.66">now with into the way they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="7.11">track inflation starting in 2014 this</text>
  <text start="625.62" dur="6.6">year they&amp;#39;re going to recalculate how</text>
  <text start="629.16" dur="4.89">they calculate inflation the newer</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.15">formula will incorporate price changes</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="7.56">in the services such as healthcare</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="8.65">financial advice housekeeping commuting</text>
  <text start="641.61" dur="8.34">and food delivery now why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="7.05">include energy and food in inflation</text>
  <text start="649.95" dur="5.73">because those are the things and they</text>
  <text start="653.07" dur="5.49">can even include those things because</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s when you go to the market where</text>
  <text start="658.56" dur="6.63">you go to buy fuel those things increase</text>
  <text start="662.07" dur="6.08">that affects your pocketbook um let me</text>
  <text start="665.19" dur="6.09">see housekeeping I don&amp;#39;t know I mean</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="4.93">that just doesn&amp;#39;t commuting what do they</text>
  <text start="671.28" dur="4.29">mean by commuting the time you spent in</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="5.3">the car you know it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="5.25">financial advice this is what it again</text>
  <text start="678.38" dur="3.73">just like they did with GDP they went</text>
  <text start="680.82" dur="4.41">back to nineteen twenty-nine they</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="5.99">included research and development in GDP</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="6.81">now they&amp;#39;re including housekeeping</text>
  <text start="688.1" dur="6.01">financial advice in inflation think</text>
  <text start="692.04" dur="4.23">about for a second what are they</text>
  <text start="694.11" dur="4.77">actually doing they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="4.65">everything why why would you have to</text>
  <text start="698.88" dur="4.44">manipulate this why would you have to</text>
  <text start="700.92" dur="6.21">change us because things are getting</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="6.75">worse and they need to mask it until</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="6.39">they reach the very last second when</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="6.72">everything comes tumbling down when the</text>
  <text start="713.52" dur="5.55">entire economy implodes this is why</text>
  <text start="716.79" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re doing this and again like I said</text>
  <text start="719.07" dur="4.02">the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="721.44" dur="4.89">because they want to show that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="723.09" dur="5.43">this recovery that things are fine that</text>
  <text start="726.33" dur="5.46">we don&amp;#39;t have to worry and then all of a</text>
  <text start="728.52" dur="6.36">sudden this major event occurs and they</text>
  <text start="731.79" dur="6.51">will blame the implosion of the economy</text>
  <text start="734.88" dur="5.34">on another country which eventually will</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="4.32">bring us to war and what will this event</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="4.08">be it could be anything they could say</text>
  <text start="742.62" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s a natural disaster they can say</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s a dirty nuke they can say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="745.92" dur="6.42">chemical attack they could say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="748.46" dur="8.38">cyber attack or they can encapsulate all</text>
  <text start="752.34" dur="6.81">of this into one and create a huge event</text>
  <text start="756.84" dur="5.13">because they realize we are at the end</text>
  <text start="759.15" dur="6.03">game and this is all they have left and</text>
  <text start="761.97" dur="7.86">they do not want to be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="765.18" dur="8.94">collapse now on another note like I said</text>
  <text start="769.83" dur="6.15">China China is moving forward and they</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="3.51">are trying to become the reserve</text>
  <text start="775.98" dur="5.01">currency of the world they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="777.63" dur="7.71">deals all over the place the countries</text>
  <text start="780.99" dur="6.15">are becoming hubs trading the u1 and</text>
  <text start="785.34" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re making deals all over the place</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="4.14">and right now China is continuing its</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="4.74">opening of the world&amp;#39;s biggest physical</text>
  <text start="791.28" dur="5.04">bullion market China has granted</text>
  <text start="794.01" dur="4.71">licences to import goal to to foreign</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="4.74">banks for the first time China is</text>
  <text start="798.72" dur="5.01">actually increasing its transparency</text>
  <text start="801.06" dur="4.47">allowing more banks to import gold and</text>
  <text start="803.73" dur="4.35">which could increase the supply of the</text>
  <text start="805.53" dur="3.67">metal into the country easing local</text>
  <text start="808.08" dur="2.89">prices</text>
  <text start="809.2" dur="4.17">this is the first step that the</text>
  <text start="810.97" dur="4.71">regulators are taking to ensure that its</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="5.37">gold futures contract in the free trade</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="4.86">zone can take off and you can see where</text>
  <text start="818.74" dur="4.83">they are headed with this they are</text>
  <text start="820.54" dur="7.02">moving forward making deals and getting</text>
  <text start="823.57" dur="6.78">ready and again this is a huge threat to</text>
  <text start="827.56" dur="5.49">the US and the central bankers because</text>
  <text start="830.35" dur="5.7">that they are fighting with military</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="6.33">force across the Middle East and in</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="5.45">Africa to maintain the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="839.38" dur="5.66">reserve currency and they are actually</text>
  <text start="841.5" dur="6.21">losing the battle at this time and again</text>
  <text start="845.04" dur="6.64">once they lose the battle and they lose</text>
  <text start="847.71" dur="7.18">Libya they lose Lebanon they lose Iraq</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="6.18">guess what happens no one needs the</text>
  <text start="854.89" dur="8.16">dollar anymore and all that money comes</text>
  <text start="857.86" dur="8.73">flooding back to the United States okay</text>
  <text start="863.05" dur="5.19">now out in Turkey which has a puppet</text>
  <text start="866.59" dur="3.75">regime controlled by the central bankers</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="4.74">in the US government the government is</text>
  <text start="870.34" dur="4.88">proposing a bill that would give it the</text>
  <text start="872.98" dur="5.85">right to shut down a website without</text>
  <text start="875.22" dur="5.08">without having to go to court why are</text>
  <text start="878.83" dur="3.72">they doing this well because they do not</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="5.07">want to lose control like the other</text>
  <text start="882.55" dur="5.58">countries and they do not want to lose</text>
  <text start="885.37" dur="4.71">control of their puppet government so</text>
  <text start="888.13" dur="4.29">this is what the puppet governments are</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="4.53">doing they are taking the rights to</text>
  <text start="892.42" dur="4.32">protest away from people they&amp;#39;re locking</text>
  <text start="894.61" dur="4.71">down the internet they are tracking</text>
  <text start="896.74" dur="4.77">people with biometrics and this is a</text>
  <text start="899.32" dur="4.85">police state this is really what it is</text>
  <text start="901.51" dur="5.37">and the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan</text>
  <text start="904.17" dur="5.23">wants to clamp down on internet rights</text>
  <text start="906.88" dur="4.95">they want to take away the rights and</text>
  <text start="909.4" dur="3.63">under the new law the internet providers</text>
  <text start="911.83" dur="3.81">would be required to join a</text>

  <text start="920.17" dur="5.16">those internet providers that do not</text>
  <text start="922.54" dur="6.72">cooperate will not have their license</text>
  <text start="925.33" dur="7.35">renewed and they will be fined they want</text>
  <text start="929.26" dur="5.46">to track and keep control of what people</text>
  <text start="932.68" dur="4.71">are seeing they will block sites they</text>
  <text start="934.72" dur="5.91">will manage what you&amp;#39;re seeing and if</text>

  <text start="942.7" dur="7.32">doing the same thing here in the US they</text>
  <text start="945.73" dur="6.36">already have a separate internet the</text>
  <text start="950.02" dur="6.6">military has already created this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.09" dur="7.32">up and running and we know DHS has some</text>
  <text start="956.62" dur="5.49">type of kill switch in place to shut the</text>
  <text start="959.41" dur="4.5">internet internet down when they need it</text>
  <text start="962.11" dur="4.86">they tried they also have a kill switch</text>
  <text start="963.91" dur="5.82">on all the phones those are being passed</text>
  <text start="966.97" dur="6.72">through every time you get an OS update</text>
  <text start="969.73" dur="6.21">because they tried to kill the phones</text>
  <text start="973.69" dur="4.47">during the Boston bombing having the</text>
  <text start="975.94" dur="3.69">service provider shut down but what they</text>
  <text start="978.16" dur="3.12">didn&amp;#39;t realize is that people still</text>
  <text start="979.63" dur="3.18">could take pictures and they took</text>
  <text start="981.28" dur="3.51">pictures of the Boston Marathon and as</text>
  <text start="982.81" dur="4.8">soon as the service was he reintroduced</text>
  <text start="984.79" dur="5.37">they were uploading and pictures went</text>
  <text start="987.61" dur="6.15">out there like crazy and that they do</text>
  <text start="990.16" dur="5.79">not want this to happen now we</text>
  <text start="993.76" dur="4.8">understand that President Obama and his</text>
  <text start="995.95" dur="4.59">panel looking at NSA they are never</text>
  <text start="998.56" dur="4.29">reeling in the NSA actually the NSA is</text>
  <text start="1000.54" dur="3.66">going to expand even further because</text>
  <text start="1002.85" dur="3.36">they don&amp;#39;t care what the American people</text>
  <text start="1004.2" dur="4.14">say they don&amp;#39;t care what the government</text>
  <text start="1006.21" dur="5.4">says they don&amp;#39;t care because they need</text>
  <text start="1008.34" dur="4.38">the central bankers the globalist the</text>
  <text start="1011.61" dur="4.41">elite whatever you want to call them</text>
  <text start="1012.72" dur="6.03">need to spy on what the American people</text>
  <text start="1016.02" dur="6.33">are doing they need to keep an eye on</text>
  <text start="1018.75" dur="6.3">everyone this is why they can&amp;#39;t stop the</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="5.76">spam from entering your mailbox this is</text>
  <text start="1025.05" dur="5.1">why they can&amp;#39;t catch those people who</text>
  <text start="1028.11" dur="4.32">stole the credit cards and target and</text>
  <text start="1030.15" dur="3.419">other retailers because they&amp;#39;re not they</text>
  <text start="1032.43" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t care about that they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="1033.569" dur="6.541">looking at the systems that they were</text>
  <text start="1035.4" dur="7.26">open to them they&amp;#39;re looking at your</text>
  <text start="1040.11" dur="4.56">email they&amp;#39;re looking at your</text>

  <text start="1047.939" dur="4.381">looking at everything that you do your</text>
  <text start="1050.37" dur="4.31">banking or financial because they need</text>
  <text start="1052.32" dur="4.5">to keep an eye on everyone especially</text>
  <text start="1054.68" dur="4.33">government officials they&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="1056.82" dur="5.61">their spying on judges and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1059.01" dur="4.5">spying on officials outside of the US</text>
  <text start="1062.43" dur="3.48">and they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="5.01">because they&amp;#39;re getting investment ideas</text>
  <text start="1065.91" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re getting patent ideas they have</text>
  <text start="1068.52" dur="4.23">information to blackmail certain judges</text>
  <text start="1070.68" dur="3.78">and different government officials and</text>
  <text start="1072.75" dur="3.99">they need to keep this</text>
  <text start="1074.46" dur="6.33">because when the collapse comes they</text>
  <text start="1076.74" dur="6.78">need to know who to go after who they</text>
  <text start="1080.79" dur="6">can control and this is why all of this</text>
  <text start="1083.52" dur="6.81">is in place and the mmm right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1086.79" dur="5.61">learning that the u.s. physically hacked</text>
  <text start="1090.33" dur="4.53">about a hundred thousand foreign</text>
  <text start="1092.4" dur="5.31">computers and all of these computers</text>
  <text start="1094.86" dur="5.67">were in China Russia the EU India Saudi</text>
  <text start="1097.71" dur="6.03">and Pakistan and they used it to gain</text>
  <text start="1100.53" dur="6.18">intelligence they are spying on every</text>
  <text start="1103.74" dur="5.91">single country as we&amp;#39;ve learned that you</text>
  <text start="1106.71" dur="6.48">know spying on Germany Spain France you</text>
  <text start="1109.65" dur="4.92">name it they are spying and there was a</text>
  <text start="1113.19" dur="3.81">report out there from New York Times</text>
  <text start="1114.57" dur="4.05">saying that there are documents from the</text>
  <text start="1117" dur="3.18">National Security Agency computer</text>
  <text start="1118.62" dur="4.77">experts and US officials stating that</text>
  <text start="1120.18" dur="5.25">the NSA uses radio wave technology to</text>
  <text start="1123.39" dur="3.78">gain access to otherwise and cryptic</text>
  <text start="1125.43" dur="4.77">computers or machines that are not</text>
  <text start="1127.17" dur="5.64">connected to the Internet and again the</text>
  <text start="1130.2" dur="8.13">NSA has created many many backdoors into</text>
  <text start="1132.81" dur="7.59">software appliances your your actual</text>
  <text start="1138.33" dur="4.47">physical PC they installed firmware or</text>
  <text start="1140.4" dur="4.41">software to get in and they have back</text>
  <text start="1142.8" dur="5.49">doors they also know the encryption keys</text>
  <text start="1144.81" dur="5.34">so any public encryption key that is out</text>
  <text start="1148.29" dur="4.14">there they already know how to break it</text>
  <text start="1150.15" dur="4.5">so it&amp;#39;s not really protecting you you</text>
  <text start="1152.43" dur="5.43">need to create a private encryption key</text>
  <text start="1154.65" dur="5.16">to protect yourself and they have</text>
  <text start="1157.86" dur="5.49">created all these back doors and again</text>
  <text start="1159.81" dur="9.63">when you open up a secure device like a</text>
  <text start="1163.35" dur="7.29">server or make a laptop or a phone or</text>
  <text start="1169.44" dur="3.45">anything like this written in the</text>
  <text start="1170.64" dur="6.54">financial institution this allows</text>
  <text start="1172.89" dur="7.59">hackers out there to identify and use</text>
  <text start="1177.18" dur="6.42">these back doors to retrieve information</text>
  <text start="1180.48" dur="6.21">like credit card information or personal</text>
  <text start="1183.6" dur="4.89">information on people or passwords so</text>
  <text start="1186.69" dur="4.95">really what they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1188.49" dur="6.03">opened up all systems and a good hacker</text>
  <text start="1191.64" dur="4.47">which search and try to find these back</text>
  <text start="1194.52" dur="4.8">doors and eventually they will and they</text>
  <text start="1196.11" dur="8.28">will use them for their own criminal</text>
  <text start="1199.32" dur="8.37">activity okay moving on here now North</text>

  <text start="1667.259" dur="5.201">factions are afraid of this person and</text>
  <text start="1670.389" dur="4.65">it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to build</text>

  <text start="1679.989" dur="5.25">this is where the false flag event is</text>
  <text start="1683.2" dur="4.229">coming from now why would they need a</text>
  <text start="1685.239" dur="7.68">false flag event well they would need to</text>
  <text start="1687.429" dur="7.261">do something either in Sochi but I think</text>
  <text start="1692.919" dur="3.96">it would it would work bed I think there</text>
  <text start="1694.69" dur="5.429">is going to be some type of an event in</text>
  <text start="1696.879" dur="6.15">Sochi which then will lead to a false</text>
  <text start="1700.119" dur="4.56">flag event here in the US and in the</text>
  <text start="1703.029" dur="4.14">Olympics they already have the FBI out</text>
  <text start="1704.679" dur="3.541">there of course anytime the FBI is out</text>
  <text start="1707.169" dur="2.7">there and they already put out the</text>
  <text start="1708.22" dur="4.409">warning that there is a terrorist threat</text>
  <text start="1709.869" dur="4.111">in Sochi and of course they had the</text>
  <text start="1712.629" dur="3.211">bombings which they want you to believe</text>
  <text start="1713.98" dur="4.829">you know those are from the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1715.84" dur="7.98">it could be al Qaeda and their building</text>
  <text start="1718.809" dur="7.411">this up and this could be a a an advance</text>
  <text start="1723.82" dur="5.88">warning that something is about to</text>
  <text start="1726.22" dur="5.339">happen and every time we see this where</text>
  <text start="1729.7" dur="4.169">they give a warning of a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1731.559" dur="4.261">threat and FBI is there something</text>
  <text start="1733.869" dur="3.87">actually does happen but I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1735.82" dur="2.589">building this up because they need to</text>
  <text start="1737.739" dur="4.641">get the</text>
  <text start="1738.409" dur="6.431">back into Iraq Lebanon and Libya to</text>
  <text start="1742.38" dur="6.299">maintain control and they are building</text>
  <text start="1744.84" dur="7.469">this up right now and again I said they</text>
  <text start="1748.679" dur="6.75">are going to use this to bring the</text>
  <text start="1752.309" dur="5.46">troops into this area and to start a war</text>
  <text start="1755.429" dur="4.441">and they could even bring it into Syria</text>
  <text start="1757.769" dur="3.9">because again we have to remember all</text>
  <text start="1759.87" dur="5.159">the things that have happened in the</text>
  <text start="1761.669" dur="5.191">past the Intel that CNN said they had</text>
  <text start="1765.029" dur="4.591">about chemical weapons being stashed</text>
  <text start="1766.86" dur="5.699">away Assad has that he&amp;#39;s been stashed</text>
  <text start="1769.62" dur="6.96">away and the UN inspectors have no</text>
  <text start="1772.559" dur="7.141">knowledge of it the dry one flight that</text>
  <text start="1776.58" dur="4.979">the airlines reported and DHS and TSA</text>
  <text start="1779.7" dur="5.459">said I don&amp;#39;t worry about it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="1781.559" dur="6.24">big of a deal and the lone wolf groups</text>
  <text start="1785.159" dur="5.281">in the United States running around they</text>
  <text start="1787.799" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t keep track of and DHS just like to</text>
  <text start="1790.44" dur="4.67">let us know that they are bomb makers</text>
  <text start="1792.029" dur="5.551">and right now Homeland Security is</text>
  <text start="1795.11" dur="5.199">flying around in helicopters over</text>
  <text start="1797.58" dur="4.319">Baltimore to map radiation levels and</text>
  <text start="1800.309" dur="3.271">this goes on to say that the US</text>
  <text start="1801.899" dur="3.571">Department of Homeland Security will fly</text>
  <text start="1803.58" dur="4.8">a helicopter over Baltimore today and</text>

  <text start="1808.38" dur="4.769">helicopter from the National Nuclear</text>
  <text start="1810.21" dur="5.91">Security Administration will fly as low</text>
  <text start="1813.149" dur="5.28">as 150 feet and will map the net</text>
  <text start="1816.12" dur="4.559">naturally occurring radiation on the</text>
  <text start="1818.429" dur="6.181">ground so if there is ever a dirty bomb</text>
  <text start="1820.679" dur="5.761">threat in Baltimore hmm Homeland</text>
  <text start="1824.61" dur="3.96">Security will be able to take to the sky</text>
  <text start="1826.44" dur="4.229">and pinpoint exact communities where</text>
  <text start="1828.57" dur="5.489">radiation levels or abnormal I have a</text>
  <text start="1830.669" dur="5.1">question about this if there is a threat</text>
  <text start="1834.059" dur="4.521">and they&amp;#39;re saying you know we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1835.769" dur="6.54">to attack someplace and of course</text>
  <text start="1838.58" dur="6.91">wouldn&amp;#39;t a terrorist put a dirty bomb</text>
  <text start="1842.309" dur="5.49">and I I don&amp;#39;t know too much about you</text>
  <text start="1845.49" dur="4.14">know the radiation levels of a dirty</text>
  <text start="1847.799" dur="3.931">bomb and I and I believe it&amp;#39;s very low</text>
  <text start="1849.63" dur="6.12">until it explodes but if they put it</text>
  <text start="1851.73" dur="7.65">into a lead box would they be able to</text>
  <text start="1855.75" dur="6.35">detect it and if they placed it far</text>
  <text start="1859.38" dur="6.149">underground enough until they needed it</text>
  <text start="1862.1" dur="5.65">how would they detect any of this so</text>
  <text start="1865.529" dur="4.471">this is leading me to believe that they</text>
  <text start="1867.75" dur="4.09">are definitely preparing for something</text>
  <text start="1870" dur="5.169">where they can say yes</text>
  <text start="1871.84" dur="5.069">we detected and we we scan the area we</text>
  <text start="1875.169" dur="4.471">know where it is and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1876.909" dur="4.441">there is a dirty bomb and boom it went</text>
  <text start="1879.64" dur="4.139">off and now we&amp;#39;re searching for more and</text>
  <text start="1881.35" dur="4.92">I can see how this is playing into some</text>
  <text start="1883.779" dur="5.52">type of false flag event and we also</text>
  <text start="1886.27" dur="6.96">have to remember the government has been</text>
  <text start="1889.299" dur="5.73">ordering ordering potassium iodide to</text>
  <text start="1893.23" dur="3.66">fight off radiation and of course</text>
  <text start="1895.029" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re either using</text>
  <text start="1896.89" dur="3.779">this for a fukushima which some reports</text>
  <text start="1899.59" dur="3.24">have said that this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1900.669" dur="5.571">using for or they&amp;#39;re using it for some</text>
  <text start="1902.83" dur="7.56">type of dirty type of nuclear bomb and</text>
  <text start="1906.24" dur="7.659">you know this is one part and also FEMA</text>
  <text start="1910.39" dur="5.519">right now is also seeking contractors</text>
