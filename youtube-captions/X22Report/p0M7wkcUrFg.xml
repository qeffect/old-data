  <text start="113.88" dur="7.54">2495 going back to October October 2nd</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="8.209">November 13th and November 20th cue has</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="7.47">continually given us a number 53 to 47</text>
  <text start="125.789" dur="7.051">because the senate was the target not</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="8.459">the house and guess what happened</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="8.61">it&amp;#39;s 53 to 47 who controls the Senate</text>
  <text start="137.349" dur="6.961">the Patriots we see Republican Cindy</text>

  <text start="147.849" dur="8.201">once again has come true Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="8.2">out 53 to 47 another Q proof</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="6.63">now Facebook it seems like they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="6.09">little bit of trouble here now Facebook</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="5.73">has publicly denied being a media</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="4.92">publisher every time there is an issue</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="5.28">with content on its site so they say</text>
  <text start="170.6" dur="4.92">okay we&amp;#39;re not a media publisher and the</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="3.93">company has long claimed to simply be a</text>
  <text start="175.52" dur="4.86">platform for their users to utilize in</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="4.35">it and as a result the social media firm</text>
  <text start="180.38" dur="5.04">cannot be held accountable for the</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="6.18">content posted there but in a recent</text>
  <text start="185.42" dur="6.78">lawsuit the company has claimed the</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="6.24">exact opposite CEO Mark Zuckerberg has</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="5.52">denied that Facebook is a publisher</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="6.6">publicly before the Senate and this is</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="6.9">how it went down Senate Senator sun&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5.43">Sullivan so which are you are you a tech</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="4.47">company or are you the world&amp;#39;s largest</text>
  <text start="206.42" dur="4.83">publisher because I think that goes to a</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="4.05">really important question on what form</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="6.05">of regulation or government action if</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="5.31">any would take Zuckerberg I gave a</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="4.51">mealy-mouthed</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="5.58">response saying he views Facebook as a</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="4.41">tech company because the primary thing</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="5.34">we do is build technology and products</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="5.34">Sullivan interjected but you said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="4.5">responsible for your content which makes</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="4.62">you kind of a publisher right Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="4.44">responds I agree that we&amp;#39;re responsible</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="5.4">for the content but we don&amp;#39;t produce the</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="4.92">content I think that when people ask us</text>
  <text start="241.58" dur="4.29">whether we&amp;#39;re a media company or</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="5.34">publisher my understanding of the heart</text>
  <text start="245.87" dur="5.19">of what they&amp;#39;re getting at is do we feel</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="5.43">responsibility for the content that&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="5.27">our platform the answer to that I think</text>
  <text start="254" dur="4.83">is clearly yes but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.33" dur="4.81">incompatible with what&amp;#39;s fundamentally</text>
  <text start="258.83" dur="5.13">at our core being a technology company</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="6.26">where the main thing that we do is have</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="6.6">engineers and build products so</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="6.01">basically the social media companies</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="5.79">like Facebook Twitter and the rest they</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="5.46">are protected by section 230 of the</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="6.27">Communications Decency Act which</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="6.75">currently grants them legal immunity for</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="6.21">content posted by social media users to</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="4.289">their supposedly neutral platforms now</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="3.75">if Facebook</text>
  <text start="289.909" dur="5.82">admits to being a publisher it could</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="6.269">lose this immunity now there has been a</text>
  <text start="295.729" dur="7.62">lawsuit that has been filed and this is</text>
  <text start="298.849" dur="6.99">a startup app 6-4-3 alleges that</text>
  <text start="303.349" dur="5.31">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg developed a</text>
  <text start="305.839" dur="5.07">malicious and fraudulent scheme to take</text>
  <text start="308.659" dur="4.05">advantage of Facebook users personal</text>
  <text start="310.909" dur="4.65">data and force other rival companies out</text>
  <text start="312.709" dur="4.71">of business in response Facebook has</text>
  <text start="315.559" dur="4.5">claimed that their decisions relating to</text>
  <text start="317.419" dur="4.351">what not to publish should be legally</text>
  <text start="320.059" dur="5.58">protected because the company is a</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="8.489">publisher now Facebook is saying that</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="7.26">they are a publisher so they can&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="330.259" dur="5.67">non publisher and a publisher at the</text>
  <text start="332.899" dur="4.8">same time so during this lawsuit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.929" dur="4.2">saying they&amp;#39;re a publisher in their</text>
  <text start="337.699" dur="3.81">testimony to the to Congress to sent to</text>
  <text start="340.129" dur="3.33">the Senate they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.509" dur="4.26">not a publisher well if they are a</text>
  <text start="343.459" dur="6.031">publisher then they lose the protection</text>
  <text start="345.769" dur="6.39">of section 230 so which is it you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.129">be both so this is very interesting and</text>
  <text start="352.159" dur="4.891">we can see that Twitter and the rest of</text>
  <text start="354.619" dur="5.82">the social media platforms they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.31">going to be dragged into this and again</text>
  <text start="360.439" dur="3.69">we have that investigation going on with</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="4.799">Twitter right now with Jack Dorsey did</text>
  <text start="364.129" dur="5.25">he lie to Congress and right now Google</text>
  <text start="367.159" dur="6.451">is going to testify in front of the</text>
  <text start="369.379" dur="8.34">Senate so all these companies are being</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="5.909">looked at with a magnifying glass now</text>
  <text start="377.719" dur="4.23">just the other day we had an article</text>
  <text start="379.519" dur="5.46">come out of the Guardian where they said</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="5.21">Assange and manna fort they met and they</text>
  <text start="384.979" dur="5.071">spoke many different times now of course</text>
  <text start="387.159" dur="5.8">the sources that they said they had</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="5.699">there are no sources the whole story</text>
  <text start="392.959" dur="4.83">seems to be completely fake and max</text>
  <text start="395.749" dur="5.72">Blumenthal an investigative journalist</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="7.261">says that this was completely fabricated</text>
  <text start="401.469" dur="7.54">it was laying the case to arrest and</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="5.519">extradite Julian Assange to the US now</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="5.07">once again remember that leak that came</text>
  <text start="410.569" dur="6.03">out where they said oh there&amp;#39;s a sealed</text>
  <text start="414.079" dur="4.471">indictment against Assange and we</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="4.53">accidentally leaked that out to the</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="4.71">public we didn&amp;#39;t mean to well I believe</text>
  <text start="421.129" dur="4.801">the deep state actually meant</text>
  <text start="423.26" dur="3.72">to do this and Trump had no knowledge of</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="3.93">this whatsoever in the Department of</text>
  <text start="426.98" dur="7.65">Justice they never even acknowledged it</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="7.62">so Assange through WikiLeaks said that</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="5.61">he denied the accusations and said they</text>
  <text start="437.48" dur="6.48">are going to seek legal action against</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="5.46">the news agency and WikiLeaks is gonna</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.89">be setting up a GoFundMe account for</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="5.49">lawyer fees manna ford has said this was</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="3.78">a complete line now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="3.33">interesting about this is that we know</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="6.69">the deep state they set up go fund me</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="7.71">accounts to fund their operations and we</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="5.52">need to go back to post 1842 because</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="4.2">these tweets coming out of WikiLeaks I</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re really Assange</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="7.44">because if we go back to 1842 this is</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="5.91">August 11 2018 it says never interfere</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="4.14">with an enemy while he&amp;#39;s in the process</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="7.65">of destroying himself gave a link to</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="8.31">WikiLeaks article on the hill and Q says</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="7.14">do you believe in coincidences we have</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="6.18">the source now the article is WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="8.66">says Senate panel requests Assange</text>
  <text start="492.5" dur="8.1">testimony in Russia probe so Assange</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="8.23">supposedly was speaking through</text>
  <text start="500.6" dur="10.77">WikiLeaks and Q is saying that no the</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="7.8">clowns have WikiLeaks website and</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="6.65">Twitter account we have the source which</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="6.539">is Assange so it makes me believe that</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="6.49">the clowns are pretending to be Assange</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="4.771">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="5.55">bring this out into the open make it</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="6.17">public and make it look like that the</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.16">United States is going after Assange</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="5.95">because we need to go back to post 23 22</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="5.22">now now this was something that we read</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="3.33">many times before this is page 20 on</text>

  <text start="1344.46" dur="6.63">see they can kill so did the Border</text>
  <text start="1348.54" dur="7.14">Patrol agents have a responsibility to</text>
  <text start="1351.09" dur="5.73">protect themselves and others yes and if</text>
  <text start="1355.68" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re attacking so</text>
  <text start="1356.82" dur="3.9">one guess what you&amp;#39;re allowed to defend</text>
  <text start="1359.22" dur="4.319">yourself and that&amp;#39;s what the Border</text>
  <text start="1360.72" dur="5.549">Patrol agents have done now Pompeo was</text>
  <text start="1363.539" dur="4.11">out there today and he gave a press</text>
  <text start="1366.269" dur="5.16">conference saying that there is no</text>
  <text start="1367.649" dur="6">direct evidence no direct reporting that</text>
  <text start="1371.429" dur="4.651">would link Saudi krint Saudi Crown</text>
  <text start="1373.649" dur="5.28">Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the murder</text>
  <text start="1376.08" dur="5.729">of The Washington Post journalist Jamal</text>
  <text start="1378.929" dur="5.25">khashoggi now James maddest he&amp;#39;s defense</text>
  <text start="1381.809" dur="3.511">secretary also came out and pretty much</text>
  <text start="1384.179" dur="4.171">said the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="1385.32" dur="4.38">now Pompeo said I do believe I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="1388.35" dur="3.6">every piece of intelligence</text>
  <text start="1389.7" dur="4.5">unless it&amp;#39;s come in the last few hours I</text>
  <text start="1391.95" dur="4.679">think I&amp;#39;ve read it all he said there is</text>
  <text start="1394.2" dur="4.02">no direct reporting connected connecting</text>
  <text start="1396.629" dur="4.38">the Crown Prince to the murder of Jamal</text>
  <text start="1398.22" dur="7.919">Khashoggi and that&amp;#39;s all I can say in an</text>
  <text start="1401.009" dur="7.14">unclassified setting now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1406.139" dur="4.081">interesting that he used the phrase an</text>
  <text start="1408.149" dur="4.74">unclassified setting because I do</text>
  <text start="1410.22" dur="5.069">believe the military intelligence they</text>
  <text start="1412.889" dur="5.88">already know who pulled this off they</text>
  <text start="1415.289" dur="6.27">already know it was mi6 deep state CIA</text>
  <text start="1418.769" dur="5.91">operatives that were pushing this agenda</text>
  <text start="1421.559" dur="4.35">and probably many others and we need to</text>
  <text start="1424.679" dur="4.37">remember we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="1425.909" dur="6.211">because think about what Brennan Yates</text>
  <text start="1429.049" dur="5.35">holder and the ret and Clinton and the</text>
  <text start="1432.12" dur="5.639">rest they were saying you must believe</text>
  <text start="1434.399" dur="5.28">the intelligence report you must act on</text>
  <text start="1437.759" dur="4.8">this and they were pushing this very</text>
  <text start="1439.679" dur="5.12">very hard now we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="1442.559" dur="5.1">because didn&amp;#39;t the CIA and the</text>
  <text start="1444.799" dur="6.041">intelligent agencies and Clinton and</text>
  <text start="1447.659" dur="5.071">Obama and the rest also say that the</text>
  <text start="1450.84" dur="4.589">Steele dossier was absolutely true and</text>
  <text start="1452.73" dur="5.039">you must listen to the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1455.429" dur="5.641">agencies well that turned out to be</text>
  <text start="1457.769" dur="4.231">false how about a wreck has weapons of</text>
  <text start="1461.07" dur="3">mass destruction</text>
  <text start="1462" dur="4.44">well faked again that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="1464.07" dur="5.219">intelligence agencies told us how about</text>
  <text start="1466.44" dur="4.979">Osama bin Laden was in Afghanistan faked</text>
  <text start="1469.289" dur="4.02">again how about terrorists carried out</text>
  <text start="1471.419" dur="4.771">the attack on the World Trade Center</text>
  <text start="1473.309" dur="5.671">faked again North Korea was responsible</text>
  <text start="1476.19" dur="5.04">for cyber attacking sony pick pictures</text>
  <text start="1478.98" dur="3.899">well that was an inside job that was the</text>
  <text start="1481.23" dur="2.549">disgruntled employee they just blend</text>
  <text start="1482.879" dur="3.42">that in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1483.779" dur="4.26">how about nobody spied on Trump the</text>
  <text start="1486.299" dur="3.301">Intelligence Agency said no we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1488.039" dur="3.931">have any record of that that was a</text>
  <text start="1489.6" dur="4.38">so the CIA the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1491.97" dur="4.86">Blumenthal Brennan Yates and the rest</text>
  <text start="1493.98" dur="6.39">are pushing Trump to accept it because</text>
  <text start="1496.83" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s real and they said so that tells</text>
  <text start="1500.37" dur="3.84">you he should be doing the opposite and</text>
  <text start="1502.14" dur="3.75">this is why when he became president and</text>
  <text start="1504.21" dur="3.03">he was coming into office he said he</text>
  <text start="1505.89" dur="3.3">wasn&amp;#39;t gonna go to the daily briefings</text>
  <text start="1507.24" dur="4.29">with the intelligent operatives because</text>
  <text start="1509.19" dur="4.83">he knew right there and then they were</text>
  <text start="1511.53" dur="4.62">going to give him fake information he</text>
  <text start="1514.02" dur="6.15">relied on military intelligence and</text>
  <text start="1516.15" dur="7.59">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s relying on now so once</text>
  <text start="1520.17" dur="4.86">again we can see the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1523.74" dur="3.18">still trying to push their agenda and</text>
  <text start="1525.03" dur="4.05">why are they pushing this agenda against</text>
  <text start="1526.92" dur="5.16">Saudi Arabia because they know if they</text>
  <text start="1529.08" dur="6.24">can put Trump against Saudi Arabia place</text>
  <text start="1532.08" dur="5.82">sanctions it would bring down everything</text>
  <text start="1535.32" dur="4.98">and they want that to happen so they can</text>
  <text start="1537.9" dur="6.39">get rid of Trump but he&amp;#39;s not falling</text>
  <text start="1540.3" dur="6.36">for it we see North Korea right now is</text>
  <text start="1544.29" dur="4.62">allowing inspectors into the country</text>
  <text start="1546.66" dur="4.35">into their main nuclear complex after</text>
  <text start="1548.91" dur="4.68">shutting it down so there are gonna</text>
  <text start="1551.01" dur="4.47">allow them to inspect it we see Russia</text>
  <text start="1553.59" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re gonna be deploying the s400</text>
  <text start="1555.48" dur="4.83">missile system to Crimea now why are</text>
  <text start="1557.85" dur="6.14">they doing this well because poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1560.31" dur="7.17">under the direction of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1563.99" dur="5.56">organizations of the UK and the u.s. at</text>
  <text start="1567.48" dur="5.91">the deep state where they tried to push</text>
  <text start="1569.55" dur="7.11">a war having Ukrainian ships sail into</text>
  <text start="1573.39" dur="5.76">Russia&amp;#39;s waters which completely failed</text>
  <text start="1576.66" dur="5.13">now Russia is saying you know something</text>
  <text start="1579.15" dur="5.09">you want to play the game let me move my</text>
  <text start="1581.79" dur="5.55">chess piece check I&amp;#39;m gonna put a</text>
  <text start="1584.24" dur="6.79">defensive missile system into Crimea and</text>
  <text start="1587.34" dur="5.82">protect the entire area because we know</text>
  <text start="1591.03" dur="4.08">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1593.16" dur="3.72">to start a war most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1595.11" dur="4.05">try to do something in Crimea or the</text>
  <text start="1596.88" dur="4.44">southeastern part of Ukraine but</text>
  <text start="1599.16" dur="5.16">poroshenko he&amp;#39;s using the same</text>
  <text start="1601.32" dur="5.46">propaganda that he used years back and</text>
  <text start="1604.32" dur="5.61">we reported on this so many times where</text>
  <text start="1606.78" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s telling us that Russia they are</text>
  <text start="1609.93" dur="4.5">deploying more and more forces on the</text>
  <text start="1611.88" dur="6.93">border and they have grown dramatically</text>
  <text start="1614.43" dur="8.31">remember we saw all of this back in the</text>
  <text start="1618.81" dur="5.79">years when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="1622.74" dur="3.78">and they kept on saying that there were</text>
  <text start="1624.6" dur="4.89">troops on the border they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1626.52" dur="4.89">ready to invade they even put up fake</text>
  <text start="1629.49" dur="3.51">pictures on Twitter and then people</text>
  <text start="1631.41" dur="3.24">started to say well this wasn&amp;#39;t from</text>
  <text start="1633" dur="4.53">then this was from someplace else and</text>
  <text start="1634.65" dur="5.52">then a reporter drove up and down the</text>
  <text start="1637.53" dur="5.85">border of Ukraine and Russia and</text>
  <text start="1640.17" dur="5.34">couldn&amp;#39;t find any troops whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="1643.38" dur="4.26">whole thing turned out to be complete</text>
  <text start="1645.51" dur="6.9">and utter propaganda and guess what</text>
  <text start="1647.64" dur="5.31">Russia never invaded Putin is a chess</text>
  <text start="1652.41" dur="3.36">player</text>
  <text start="1652.95" dur="4.65">he knows what poroshenko the</text>
  <text start="1655.77" dur="4.8">intelligence organizations are trying to</text>
  <text start="1657.6" dur="6.24">do he knows the deep state is trying to</text>
  <text start="1660.57" dur="6.72">push them into war he doesn&amp;#39;t react like</text>
  <text start="1663.84" dur="3.93">that Trump doesn&amp;#39;t react like that Xi</text>
  <text start="1667.29" dur="4.26">Jinping</text>
  <text start="1667.77" dur="7.59">does not react like that the deep state</text>
  <text start="1671.55" dur="7.53">they are stuck they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1675.36" dur="8.13">push their events unless they do them</text>
  <text start="1679.08" dur="6.54">themselves I mean yes can they perform a</text>
  <text start="1683.49" dur="3.9">cyberattack on the United States</text>

  <text start="1687.39" dur="5.039">infrastructure of course they can can</text>
  <text start="1689.79" dur="5.55">they try to fire missiles at a country</text>
  <text start="1692.429" dur="5.761">of course they can but again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1695.34" dur="4.92">being watched right now so it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="1698.19" dur="4.14">more and more difficult for them to pull</text>
  <text start="1700.26" dur="5.58">these things off yes will events slip by</text>
  <text start="1702.33" dur="6.08">well to be able to kick one off yes but</text>
  <text start="1705.84" dur="6.27">as they try to push more and more events</text>

  <text start="1712.11" dur="6.3">closing in around them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1714.54" dur="6.75">trying to deflect everything that is</text>
