  <text start="206.49" dur="2.97">downgrading right now because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="3.75">gonna have to go further down as the</text>
  <text start="209.46" dur="5.64">year goes on we saw this i mean we</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="4.62">continually see this with gdp where they</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.01">say in the beginning of the year or the</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="5.43">year previous that gdp is going to be at</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.95">three percent then we start the year</text>
  <text start="222" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a disaster they lowered to 2.7 we</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="3.36">go through the middle of the year okay</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s two percent and they continually do</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="4.95">this all throughout the year because</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="7.08">they know that this whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="6.9">complete phony economy and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="6.54">controlling it as best as they possibly</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="9.3">can but sometimes you can only control</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="6.72">so much here in the United States I see</text>
  <text start="249.57" dur="4.08">it all over the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="8.67">they&amp;#39;re saying US consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="8.39">the highest we&amp;#39;ve seen in 2015 and then</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="7.26">I started looking closely at this and</text>
  <text start="262.04" dur="9.19">what you realize is the information</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re taking is from a sponsored a US</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="7.53">government sponsored conference board</text>

  <text start="278.76" dur="6.9">that US consumer confidence sword to the</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="7.05">highest in August but if you go to the</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="7.14">non government sponsored like gallop</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s the actual opposite of course as we</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="4.4">know the corporate media is not going to</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="3.14">go to gallop and say okay</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="4.53">our confidence is way down when they</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="3.75">have the sponsored conference board</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="3.81">saying that its way up because of</text>
  <text start="303.419" dur="3.631">government wants the good news out there</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.92">to convince everyone that were in a</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="7.739">recovery but gallop when you look at it</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="6.21">says the actual opposite and if you</text>

  <text start="734.999" dur="4.351">going on with the market they know when</text>
  <text start="737.22" dur="3.69">to do something because again this is</text>
  <text start="739.35" dur="4.199">completely manipulated it&amp;#39;s controlled</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="8.009">by the central bankers it&amp;#39;s not an open</text>
  <text start="743.549" dur="9.5">fair market and what&amp;#39;s very odd about</text>
  <text start="748.919" dur="9.45">all of this is it&amp;#39;s starting to mimic</text>
  <text start="753.049" dur="9.27">1929 2008 where we see in the summer</text>
  <text start="758.369" dur="8.58">months if we go back to August of 1929</text>
  <text start="762.319" dur="7.87">we see that the market dropped and it</text>
  <text start="766.949" dur="5.161">dropped and it went back up and people</text>
  <text start="770.189" dur="7.74">thought oh we&amp;#39;re back in a recovery</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="7.86">everything is fine we saw in 2008 we</text>
  <text start="777.929" dur="4.71">were at the highs and may have 13,000</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="6.089">points july and august dropped I mean</text>
  <text start="782.639" dur="5.49">july dropped to 11,000 points August it</text>
  <text start="786.059" dur="4.38">was pumped back up to 11,000 date and</text>
  <text start="788.129" dur="4.95">then guess what happened in October it</text>
  <text start="790.439" dur="6.9">completely fell apart here in august of</text>
  <text start="793.079" dur="6.48">2015 we were at a high of about eighteen</text>
  <text start="797.339" dur="5.821">thousand one hundred points august</text>
  <text start="799.559" dur="6.44">dropped down to 16,000 now during these</text>
  <text start="803.16" dur="5.729">times each time they called this a</text>
  <text start="805.999" dur="5.37">correction and after the correction they</text>
  <text start="808.889" dur="8.19">said everything is fine the economy is</text>
  <text start="811.369" dur="8.32">stronger and what we are seeing with the</text>
  <text start="817.079" dur="6.09">corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="819.689" dur="6.471">that you know we have never seen a game</text>
  <text start="823.169" dur="6.6">like this when the market went up today</text>
  <text start="826.16" dur="5.56">you know during a down market which is</text>
  <text start="829.769" dur="3.93">completely untrue because</text>
  <text start="831.72" dur="3.57">six of the ten largest point games in</text>

  <text start="845.91" dur="5.34">an increase of eight hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="847.5" dur="6.66">nine points and it goes on and on and on</text>
  <text start="851.25" dur="5.519">just because they can pump the</text>
  <text start="854.16" dur="5.279">mark-it-up doesn&amp;#39;t mean things are</text>
  <text start="856.769" dur="6.24">better it means they&amp;#39;re pumping it up</text>
  <text start="859.439" dur="7.171">trying to make them better and guess</text>
  <text start="863.009" dur="7.051">what they can only do so much because</text>
  <text start="866.61" dur="7.019">the real market will always take over</text>
