  <text start="63.64" dur="6.19">2018 and the totally episode is that</text>
  <text start="66.53" dur="6.56">people are going to be shocked 30% to</text>
  <text start="69.83" dur="5.58">50% fall and net worth dead ahead</text>
  <text start="73.09" dur="5.59">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="75.41" dur="6.06">financial news now yesterday and today</text>
  <text start="78.68" dur="4.65">they were crazy days in the crypto</text>
  <text start="81.47" dur="4.41">market and we&amp;#39;re seeing these huge</text>
  <text start="83.33" dur="5.819">swings from you know Bitcoin going down</text>
  <text start="85.88" dur="5.129">to 10,000 then moving up again and again</text>
  <text start="89.149" dur="4.771">this is something that we talked about</text>
  <text start="91.009" dur="5.28">where the central bankers they like to</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="4.08">make other systems look volatile this</text>
  <text start="96.289" dur="2.701">way they can create laws and we know</text>
  <text start="98" dur="3.479">that Steve minutiae</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="5.519">is already doing this where he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="6.331">together with other leaders trying to</text>
  <text start="104.509" dur="5.341">create these laws that will safeguard</text>
  <text start="107.81" dur="2.729">the people but we don&amp;#39;t this is not what</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s really about</text>
  <text start="110.539" dur="6.871">and we know prior to 1913 the central</text>
  <text start="115.64" dur="4.41">bankers did this to the u.s. dollar</text>
  <text start="117.41" dur="4.83">where they made it seem so volatile that</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="4.049">you need us you can&amp;#39;t manage the economy</text>
  <text start="122.24" dur="3.81">without us and the same thing is</text>
  <text start="124.099" dur="4.83">happening now they want people to</text>
  <text start="126.05" dur="5.88">understand that cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="5.551">especially Bitcoin right now is unstable</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="3.87">and it looks like this is what is</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="3.27">happening because we&amp;#39;re seeing this huge</text>
  <text start="135.8" dur="6.21">sell-off but what&amp;#39;s more interesting is</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="7.709">that online gold sales skyrocketed by</text>
  <text start="142.01" dur="7.199">400% as the cryptocurrency market saw a</text>
  <text start="145.459" dur="7.171">huge sell-off now people look to place</text>
  <text start="149.209" dur="6.121">their currency in a safe area outside of</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="4.95">the system and when I say outside of the</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="4.71">system outside of the system that the</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="3.69">central bankers can control now we know</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="3.18">the stock market is completely</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="4.14">manipulated by the central bankers</text>
  <text start="163.22" dur="3.989">crypto currencies on the other hand</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="3.719">people were pouring into that because of</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="3.36">one because it was going up very very</text>
  <text start="169.129" dur="4.621">quickly and people were making huge</text>
  <text start="170.569" dur="4.651">profits too everyone believes that this</text>
  <text start="173.75" dur="3.84">is completely outside the system which</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="5.519">it really is even though it&amp;#39;s not a real</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="6.869">you know currency it was a place you can</text>
  <text start="180.739" dur="5.171">put your funds and it was outside of the</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="3.911">central bank&amp;#39;s grid</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="5.05">until you sold it off of course and</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="3.79">we&amp;#39;ve said before that the central banks</text>
  <text start="190.96" dur="3.12">what they&amp;#39;ll try to do is they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="192.16" dur="4.05">make waves here to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="6.12">that cryptocurrencies is very volatile</text>
  <text start="196.21" dur="5.94">and people you know as the downturn hit</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="3.72">and cryptocurrencies people took their</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="3.27">currency and this was happening out in</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="4.11">Europe not here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="5.19">they were throwing it into gold coins</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="6.96">because the Europe&amp;#39;s largest online</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="7.74">dealer reported that almost 1.2 million</text>
  <text start="214.99" dur="7.74">was sold and they&amp;#39;re saying this was a</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="6.39">huge surge in the sale of gold coins</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="3.66">about four hundred percent or so so</text>
  <text start="224.74" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re looking at this and we can see</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.73">that we still have a ways to go here but</text>
  <text start="229.24" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re gonna continually you know bring</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="3.84">the crypto market down bring it back up</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="4.11">with these sell offs they have the</text>
  <text start="235.96" dur="5.49">ability to do this but as we notice the</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="6.48">crypto market always bounces back after</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="5.07">they push their agenda the gold market</text>
  <text start="244.81" dur="4.32">they were able to push down with paper</text>
  <text start="246.52" dur="5.73">contracts which they would sell on the</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="5.55">market and that would push the gold</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="5.37">price down it seems like they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="4.26">the same thing in both areas and when we</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="3.27">look at this we could see why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="3.78">trying to make people believe that this</text>
  <text start="260.89" dur="3.66">is not a place to put your currency just</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="3.9">like gold is not a place to put your</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="3.51">currency actually put it in the stock</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="3.12">market see how that just keeps going up</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="3.93">and up and up and we never have problems</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="4.04">that&amp;#39;s what they really want now we</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="5.49">talked about the social security</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="7">problems here in the US and it looks</text>
  <text start="277.48" dur="5.31">like there are many many problems with</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="3.66">social security number one the social</text>
  <text start="282.79" dur="5.22">security shortfall is growing three</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="6.39">times faster than the US economy people</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="6.78">turning 70 today expect to be alive when</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="6.24">benefits are reduced in 2016 the program</text>
  <text start="294.79" dur="4.65">lost more money than it collected over</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="5.67">the course of 2016 the program&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="6.87">unfunded liabilities rose to 1.2</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="5.94">trillion dollars dependency on social</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="4.38">security Rises with age in fact the</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="3.989">original report shows that dependency</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.25">rises by more than 60 percent between</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="5.461">the ages of 70 and 80 and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="3.29">seeing is we&amp;#39;re headed into this period</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="3.86">of time</text>
  <text start="319.23" dur="6.33">where all these programs that they set</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="6.72">up back in the day they&amp;#39;re all going to</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="4.89">end up failing because this is all being</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="4.89">controlled by the central banking system</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="5.51">and what I mean by this is when they</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="4.71">place government&amp;#39;s into so much debt</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="7.57">governments normally go to different</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="7.02">areas to fund their programs and they</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="5.43">also borrow from the central bank which</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="5.34">continually adds to the debt and this</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="4.2">continually happens now of course they</text>
  <text start="350.67" dur="4.23">trade paper for paper like oh we&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="3.12">from the Social Security Fund and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="3.99">just replace that with Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s what Clinton did and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="3.54">seeing right now is that the money that</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="2.58">was in Social Security that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="2.67">people&amp;#39;s money that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="3.48">government&amp;#39;s money well it&amp;#39;s all the</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="3.63">people&amp;#39;s money but we actually put our</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="3.99">money into this to get our money back</text>
  <text start="368.73" dur="4.14">out of it and it looks like they can</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="4.05">they continually go into it and they</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="3.42">continually take what they need and this</text>
  <text start="374.91" dur="3.15">is why there&amp;#39;s a problem this is why</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.41">they have to continually borrow to place</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="5.07">money in there but with the central</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="6.6">banking system all of these programs</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="8.07">can&amp;#39;t work because when there is a</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="7.11">dollar that is created it is loaned to</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="6.45">the government and they expect a dollar</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="7.71">and maybe 25 cents back but that 25</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="6.21">cents doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet so the</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="4.46">government has to borrow more so think</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="6.45">about it the central bank is created</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="7.3">loans the government a million dollars</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="8.55">and now the government owes the central</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="8.97">bank a million point to where do they</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="5.91">get the $200,000 well it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="3.54">because it doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet so they</text>
  <text start="424.77" dur="5.13">have to go back to the central bank and</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="8.46">they have to borrow more and then they</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="6.24">owe more the game doesn&amp;#39;t work it</text>
  <text start="434.85" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t well it works well for the</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="5.37">central bankers it doesn&amp;#39;t work for the</text>
  <text start="438.6" dur="4.65">people you can&amp;#39;t pay off all the debt</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s just not enough money out there</text>
  <text start="443.25" dur="5.97">to pay it all off because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="6.39">interest attached and we can see right</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="3.96">now that it is completely impossible the</text>
  <text start="452.19" dur="4.17">system fail</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="7.29">every single time the only group that</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="6.27">benefits are those that are in line with</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="4.8">the central bank and the central bank</text>
  <text start="462.63" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s it the people they never make out</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="4.86">from this because when everything is</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="5.609">reevaluated when the currency dies they</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="6.12">lose their wealth we see that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="472.949" dur="4.621">out there and they&amp;#39;ve come out with</text>
  <text start="476.25" dur="4.259">their beige book and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s modest wage growth that the</text>
  <text start="480.509" dur="5.041">labor market is tightening and all this</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="5.73">is a bunch of nonsense because as we</text>
  <text start="485.55" dur="5.31">know they&amp;#39;re not really giving us the</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="4.83">truth they&amp;#39;re making stuff up going on</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="3.989">the manipulated data and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="4.079">reporting on the manipulated data so</text>
  <text start="494.849" dur="4.231">think about it the government comes out</text>
  <text start="496.979" dur="3.961">with manipulated data the central bank</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="3.899">is then reporting on that manipulated</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="4.56">data the corporate media then spreads it</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="5.341">across you know all their platforms and</text>
  <text start="505.5" dur="5.28">everyone&amp;#39;s believing this manipulated</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="5.07">data it&amp;#39;s one gigantic illusion so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.78" dur="4.379">really absolutely meaningless what the</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="3.75">Fed says I actually look at their</text>
  <text start="515.159" dur="4.081">actions instead of what they say because</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="4.05">usually what they say is the opposite of</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="6.09">what is really happening now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="7.35">interesting is China they decided to</text>
  <text start="525.33" dur="7.5">downgrade the US credit rating from a -</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="8.299">to triple b-plus remember when S&amp;amp;P tried</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="6.57">to do this right after the 2008 crisis</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="7.211">well they got slammed they were gonna be</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="7.98">sued and they backed off and we can see</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="5.909">right now that China is saying that yeah</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="4.56">there are problems here now they have</text>
  <text start="549.959" dur="4.021">about 1.2 trillion dollars in US</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="4.649">Treasuries and it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="5.13">selling that off right now and the</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="4.74">Chinese credit rating downgraded US</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="5.82">sovereign ratings from a - the triple</text>
  <text start="561.329" dur="7.95">b-plus overnight citing deficiencies in</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="6.51">US political ecology and tax cuts that</text>
  <text start="569.279" dur="3.981">deck directly reduced the federal</text>
  <text start="571.44" dur="4.26">government sources of debt repayment</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="6.18">weakening the base of the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.7" dur="7.65">debt repayment and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="5.019">this credit agency was set up during the</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="2.67">same time they were setting up</text>
  <text start="584.459" dur="2.491">everything else because we know that</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="4.16">everything is moving</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="6.54">the west to the east and now China is</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="6.399">calling the shots and once again what is</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="6.899">Moody&amp;#39;s gonna do what is SP going to do</text>
  <text start="596.579" dur="5.671">what is Fitch going to do because as we</text>
  <text start="600.389" dur="5.31">can see the world is going to be looking</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="5.67">at China and they are now making the</text>
  <text start="605.699" dur="6.75">call saying listen we don&amp;#39;t trust you</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="7.74">anymore your debt we don&amp;#39;t believe you</text>
  <text start="612.449" dur="5.671">can repay and we&amp;#39;re downgrading you to</text>
  <text start="615.66" dur="4.679">triple B plus now we&amp;#39;ve seen this happen</text>
  <text start="618.12" dur="3.839">to other countries before and people go</text>
  <text start="620.339" dur="5.851">out it&amp;#39;s triple B plus it&amp;#39;s still fine</text>
  <text start="621.959" dur="6.331">but as the debt grows and as China</text>
  <text start="626.19" dur="3.48">decides the sell-off now because why</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="4.109">would you want to hold it in which they</text>
  <text start="629.67" dur="4.8">have been doing and Russia sells off and</text>
  <text start="632.399" dur="4.711">the rest of the countries start to sell</text>
  <text start="634.47" dur="5.82">off a little bit at a time the rating is</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="7.02">going to drop and drop and drop and drop</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="5.97">because the trust disappears and people</text>
  <text start="644.13" dur="5.19">believe don&amp;#39;t believe that they can</text>
  <text start="646.26" dur="5.97">repay this that debt increases the</text>
  <text start="649.32" dur="5.519">situation just gets worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="652.23" dur="4.349">here&amp;#39;s the kicker which is very</text>
  <text start="654.839" dur="3.601">interesting and everyone in the past</text>
  <text start="656.579" dur="3.781">said oh they&amp;#39;re raising the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s not that big a deal get rid of the</text>
  <text start="660.36" dur="3.919">debt ceiling which means that they have</text>
  <text start="662.37" dur="5.25">this credit card that they can run up to</text>

  <text start="828.43" dur="3.36">these different countries I&amp;#39;m talking is</text>
