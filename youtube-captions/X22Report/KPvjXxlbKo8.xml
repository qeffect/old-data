  <text start="30.65" dur="4.96">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="4.201">when I to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="6.3">this is episode 1095 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="6.45">is October 7 2016 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="6.78">episode is Obama&amp;#39;s illusionary recovery</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="7.05">is being ripped apart let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="6.84">economic collapse financial news now in</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="9.529">the past couple of days we have seen the</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="8.519">gold price suppressed now we know that</text>
  <text start="61.309" dur="6.31">gold and silver the precious metals</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="8.18">market they are manipulated we know</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="9.061">because HSBC Deutsche Bank Nova Scotia</text>
  <text start="72.229" dur="6.521">ubs and most likely many others they</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="4.53">have been manipulating the gold market</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="5.159">there&amp;#39;s lawsuits now charges being</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="5.01">brought up on these different banks and</text>
  <text start="83.909" dur="6.121">we know the central bank is always</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="6.87">behind all of this controlling the other</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.89">banks and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="5.33">that the gold price was brought down</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="8.04">quite a bit and it looks like someone</text>
  <text start="98.42" dur="7.479">decided to dump about 2.25 billion of</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="8.219">notional gold into the futures market</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="10.801">and bringing the gold back down to the</text>
  <text start="111.179" dur="8.58">1250 level now of course we know that</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="5.82">this is manipulation we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="5.521">past where thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="6.06">contracts are thrown at the gold market</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="6.81">to bring it down and we can see right</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="6.78">now every time the gold prices drop by</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="6.08">this much there&amp;#39;s normally some type of</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="6.48">financial event about to happen or</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for news to</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="3.45">come out about something maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="4.68">Deutsche Bank we know the unemployment</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="5.82">numbers came out today but it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="5.55">something there&amp;#39;s always a reason why</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="5.61">they do this because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="5.1">keep this economy looking like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="6.39">still in recovery mode but that whole</text>
  <text start="158.82" dur="5.61">that whole entire mantra of we recovered</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="4.019">well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="4.32">falling apart completely we see by the</text>
  <text start="167.129" dur="5.071">unemployment numbers the unemployment</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="5.489">rate has risen back up to 5.0 percent we</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="4.319">know this is not the real number this is</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="3.931">the manipulated number but we can see</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="5.131">right now it&amp;#39;s getting more and more</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="5.069">difficult for the central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="4.14">government to manipulate these numbers</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="5.521">because it&amp;#39;s getting very difficult to</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="5.64">do so because what happens is as more</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="5.309">and more people are unemployed what do</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="4.83">they say half the country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="3.75">want to work anymore three-quarters of</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="5.159">the country they don&amp;#39;t want to work</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="6.42">anymore actually before the numbers even</text>
  <text start="201.419" dur="4.65">came out Goldman was out there saying</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="3.86">that they thought they were the job</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="4.95">numbers were going to be adding about</text>
  <text start="208.099" dur="5.86">200,000 jobs but really the numbers came</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="6.03">in where they only added about 156,000</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="6.241">jobs so we see right now that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="5.701">about 94 million people out of the labor</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="4.259">force and when we look at these job</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="4.139">numbers when you hear the numbers you</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="5.45">think oh look people are gaining full</text>
  <text start="226.889" dur="6.871">time jobs everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="229.909" dur="5.8">realistically these individuals are not</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="4.89">getting these full-time high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="7.321">they&amp;#39;re getting part-time low-paying</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="9.299">jobs and what we are seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="8.4">that the job numbers of those who are</text>
  <text start="247.949" dur="6.841">working full time it is continually</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="7.079">falling because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="6.27">breakdown in September job quality the</text>
  <text start="258.509" dur="4.081">number of multiple job holders or people</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="5.97">who are forced to hold more than one job</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="9.99">to do to insufficient wages or for other</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="10.319">reasons that is increasing because</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="9.24">there&amp;#39;s about 300 and 1,000 more people</text>
  <text start="277.349" dur="7.41">in America holding more than one job the</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="5.25">fifth highest monthly spike in the past</text>
  <text start="284.759" dur="5.88">decade the total number of multiple job</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="5.76">holders sword 27.8 63 million the</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="6.121">highest number since the financial</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="5.5">crisis and a number surpassed just once</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="5.02">in the past decade</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="8.089">August of 2008 just before the entire</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="7.71">system completely broke apart so it also</text>
  <text start="306.419" dur="4.421">begs the question how many of the</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="4.56">hundred and fifty six thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="6">added were double counted as a result of</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.579">number of multiple job holders that was</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="5.24">double this amount well you have to</text>
  <text start="319.629" dur="5.84">think about this for a second the way</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="8.28">the US government central bankers count</text>
  <text start="325.469" dur="7.091">jobs is they count a part-time job as a</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="4.69">full-time job so if you have one two</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="7.259">three jobs that&amp;#39;s one two three</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="7.549">full-time jobs if you lose that part</text>
  <text start="339.819" dur="7.65">time job they don&amp;#39;t really count it as</text>
  <text start="342.599" dur="7.091">losing a full-time job because the rules</text>
  <text start="347.469" dur="5.13">state and it&amp;#39;s different from each state</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="7.56">it depends on how many hours you work</text>
  <text start="352.599" dur="7.951">and what your salary is your part-time</text>
  <text start="357.25" dur="6.27">salary so if you&amp;#39;re not earning enough</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="5.85">and you&amp;#39;re not working enough hours they</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="6.449">don&amp;#39;t count you as losing a full-time</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="6.72">job this is how they manipulate these</text>
  <text start="369.969" dur="6.361">numbers so where did the September jobs</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="7.38">go well it looks like they went to</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="9.509">waiters bartenders and we can see right</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="11.25">now in September that number increased</text>
  <text start="385.839" dur="9.54">by 30,000 and the number of low-wage</text>
  <text start="391.75" dur="8.58">workers increased by 300,000 over this</text>
  <text start="395.379" dur="6.301">year so far so more than half of the</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="4.079">hundred and fifty six thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="6.269">added in September went once again to</text>
  <text start="404.409" dur="6.391">minimum wage workers what about the</text>
  <text start="407.949" dur="5.541">higher paying jobs well manufacturing</text>
  <text start="410.8" dur="4.799">that has declined by 13,000</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="4.479">transportation warehousing dipped by</text>
  <text start="415.599" dur="5.011">nine thousand there was no change in</text>
  <text start="417.969" dur="4.831">mining and logging workers financial</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="4.41">activity workers that only rose by six</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="6.06">thousand in September so we can see</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="6.32">right now this situation with the job</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="4.19">market it</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="3.54">not improving it is actually getting</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="3.81">worse now these are all manipulated</text>
  <text start="434.88" dur="4.68">numbers that the government is feeding</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="7.86">us and when you look at what has</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="8.13">happened going back in time let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="5.64">back to 2014 for instance the US has</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="4.949">added five hundred and forty-seven</text>
  <text start="450.36" dur="9.21">thousand waiters and bartenders and has</text>
  <text start="452.639" dur="11.581">lost 32,000 manufacturing jobs if we go</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="6.84">back to 2007 the US has gained 1.7</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="7.04">million waiters and bartenders and has</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="10.17">lost 1.5 million manufacturing workers</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="11.17">in 2016 58,000 manufacturing jobs have</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="8.49">been lost this is not a recovery now</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="5.489">this is a manipulation by the US</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="5.909">government central bankers when you look</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="6.06">at other calculations like John Williams</text>
  <text start="490.979" dur="5.701">from shadow stats we can see the job</text>
  <text start="493.979" dur="5.821">numbers the unemployment rate is very</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="4.59">close to thirty percent compared to what</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="4.23">the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.64">telling us and challenger grain</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="6.75">Christmas is also reporting there more</text>
  <text start="506.91" dur="5.64">and more people being laid off now</text>
  <text start="510.78" dur="4.319">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="4.109">corporate media is trying to explain why</text>
  <text start="515.099" dur="4.801">this is happening why the unemployment</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="8.041">rate went up a little bit they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="9.439">that the u.s. is nearly out of people to</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="7.74">hire they can&amp;#39;t find any more people</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="5.741">jobs are all filled up we&amp;#39;ve run out of</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="4.62">people there&amp;#39;s no one left to put into</text>
  <text start="535.08" dur="5.34">these jobs because we have all these job</text>
  <text start="537.06" dur="5.55">openings now remember how this whole</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="6.24">thing works the job openings in the</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="6.53">corporations are job openings that</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="4.619">they&amp;#39;re never going to fill because</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="4.21">corporations what they normally do is</text>
  <text start="551.279" dur="5.131">they don&amp;#39;t like to take the job rex away</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="4.95">they leave the job openings open they</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="3.99">might interview people most likely they</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t interview people but they never</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="4.56">fill them because each department is</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="5.1">very nervous too</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="5.79">okay you know since we can&amp;#39;t hire anyone</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="5.01">we don&amp;#39;t need this job req also coming</text>
  <text start="570.75" dur="4.14">down from corporate they tell you listen</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re going to keep all these job rex</text>
  <text start="574.89" dur="5.43">open but at this point we&amp;#39;re in a hiring</text>
  <text start="577.53" dur="4.59">freeze you cannot hire someone but you</text>
  <text start="580.32" dur="4.14">still need to look for those individuals</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="4.38">and this is why we see this problem</text>
  <text start="584.46" dur="4.47">today it&amp;#39;s not because we&amp;#39;re running out</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="5.13">of people it&amp;#39;s because corporations are</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="5.07">laying off more and more people and when</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="6.53">you&amp;#39;re laying off people usually freeze</text>
  <text start="594" dur="6.2">hiring companies that aren&amp;#39;t hiring</text>
  <text start="598.16" dur="5.14">normally they just freeze hiring</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="4.42">altogether because they&amp;#39;re staying even</text>
  <text start="603.3" dur="3.9">they don&amp;#39;t want to move in either</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="6.45">direction we see the real estate market</text>
  <text start="607.2" dur="7.17">is continually falling apart we know</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="5.52">that New York that real estate market is</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="6.24">declining the Hamptons declining San</text>
  <text start="616.59" dur="6.15">Francisco declining Florida declining we</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="3.96">see in Chicago the real estate market</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="4.32">turned in a weak performance in</text>
  <text start="624.57" dur="4.56">September closings were down by point</text>
  <text start="627.06" dur="4.95">nine percent from last year and also</text>
  <text start="629.13" dur="4.8">down from 2013 the Illinois Association</text>
  <text start="632.01" dur="5.3">of Realtors they&amp;#39;re going to report a</text>
  <text start="633.93" dur="6.93">three point two percent decline in sales</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="6.69">contract activity which precedes closing</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="8.22">by one to two months is telling us that</text>
  <text start="644" dur="7.03">momentum is sliding and real estate is</text>
  <text start="649.08" dur="4.2">declining so we&amp;#39;re starting to see all</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="4.05">these areas where everything is starting</text>
  <text start="653.28" dur="3.53">to come to a screeching halt and</text>
  <text start="655.08" dur="3.9">everything&amp;#39;s starting to decline</text>
  <text start="656.81" dur="3.94">wholesale inventories they have</text>
  <text start="658.98" dur="4.62">contracted for the first time in six</text>
  <text start="660.75" dur="4.92">years there&amp;#39;s a point one percent</text>
  <text start="663.6" dur="6.86">decline year-on-year this is the first</text>
  <text start="665.67" dur="9.69">time since June of 2010 and it always</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="7.75">coincides with a US economic recession</text>
  <text start="675.36" dur="5.46">and this is where we are headed we see</text>
  <text start="678.21" dur="6.06">the Atlanta Fed has cut its</text>
  <text start="680.82" dur="6.06">third-quarter gdp forecast by forty five</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="4.95">percent in two months they continually</text>
  <text start="686.88" dur="5.73">are revising revising and bringing down</text>
  <text start="689.22" dur="5.49">the GDP most likely we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="692.61" dur="5.76">under or very close to one percent of</text>
  <text start="694.71" dur="5.76">GDP when this is all said and done</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="4.29">we see right now that Deutsche Bank is</text>
  <text start="700.47" dur="4.53">in a huge amount of trouble there were</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="7.02">rumors that Qatar Investment was going</text>
  <text start="705" dur="6.589">to take a huge investment in Deutsche</text>
  <text start="709.68" dur="4.62">Bank it looks like that was rejected</text>
  <text start="711.589" dur="6.311">Deutsche Bank is continually exploring</text>
  <text start="714.3" dur="6.24">capital to help out the situation that</text>
  <text start="717.9" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re in there are reports that there</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="4.17">is some type of investor who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="722.7" dur="4.53">do a capital inflow into Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="724.71" dur="6.18">but again this is a band-aid fix what</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="6.21">happens as time goes on we can see that</text>
  <text start="730.89" dur="5.43">this situation is not going to get</text>
  <text start="733.44" dur="7.53">better at all actually they tried this</text>
  <text start="736.32" dur="6.72">in 2008 with Bear Stearns AIG and all</text>
  <text start="740.97" dur="5.7">the others and each time they needed</text>
  <text start="743.04" dur="6.78">more and more and more because the</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="4.8">system is failing and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="749.82" dur="5.16">seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing the start</text>
  <text start="751.47" dur="5.7">of it we&amp;#39;re seeing that the United</text>
