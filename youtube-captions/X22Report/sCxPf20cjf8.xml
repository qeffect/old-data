  <text start="47.18" dur="5.14">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="50.79" dur="4.74">when we chill rapport my name is dave</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="5.79">and this is episode 1185 a and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="4.98">date is january twenty third 2017 and</text>
  <text start="58.11" dur="5.07">the title of the episode is the last two</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="6.12">times the sku was this high the market</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="6.51">plunged let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="5.73">collapse financial news now lately we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="69.69" dur="4.98">been hearing a lot about how Trump is</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="4.23">making deals with many different</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="4.58">companies to bring jobs back to America</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="5.22">and it sounds fantastic on the surface</text>
  <text start="79.25" dur="4.869">you know jobs coming back to America</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="4.29">factories being built billions of</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="5.881">dollars being invested in the country</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="6.18">but right now it&amp;#39;s just talk no jobs</text>
  <text start="90" dur="5.46">have been created no factories have been</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="7.76">built and we get a strange announcement</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="8.46">from IBM now IBM announced in december</text>
  <text start="100.04" dur="6.85">that it&amp;#39;s going to hire 25,000 workers</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="6.66">in the US now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="5.49">because IBM right now is laying off</text>
  <text start="110.58" dur="5.01">workers and all the laid-off workers are</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="5.55">saying we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.98">laid off or we are already laid off and</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="6.08">you&amp;#39;re going to be hiring 25,000 people</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="6.06">in the US what&amp;#39;s wrong with this picture</text>
  <text start="124.01" dur="5.199">now all of this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense i</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="3.95">know the car companies are saying that</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="3.481">yes they&amp;#39;re going to be building</text>
  <text start="130.58" dur="4">manufacturing plants they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="3.45">bringing workers back and giving them</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="3.9">jobs in America Walmart&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="4.53">creating 10,000 jobs they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="4.319">building stores all over the place well</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="5.099">this is all very suspicious because</text>
  <text start="142.799" dur="7.231">first of all the car companies their</text>
  <text start="145.769" dur="6.151">sales aren&amp;#39;t there and right now it</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="4.679">looks like they&amp;#39;re topping off and</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="5.25">things are starting to decline in retail</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="5.521">well that&amp;#39;s a complete disaster in</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.46">itself and we can see that all these</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="3.93">companies that are promising this well I</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t know if they can deliver at this</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.65">point because if we look at IBM for</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="6.18">instance revenues in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="4.679">fell to twenty one point eight billion</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="3.48">this is the 19th quarter to Rho</text>
  <text start="173.489" dur="5.371">year-over-year that they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="4.88">declines in 2016 their revenues fell two</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="4.24">percent this is why there</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="5.6">laying off people actually corporations</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="4.96">they&amp;#39;re not seeing profits right now</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.08">this is why they&amp;#39;re laying off people</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="6.81">buying back their own stock pushing</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="5.88">their stock prices up and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="6.12">that all these companies are making</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="7.29">promises and most likely they will not</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5">be able to keep them so IBM is out there</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;re giving us a lot of ifs</text>
  <text start="205.99" dur="5.32">spokesman doug shelton told bloomberg</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="5.67">about hiring those 25,000 people as the</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="6.12">layoffs would also continue oh that</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="5.82">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense if we are able to</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="5.61">fill these positions he said and that</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="5.28">could be a big if if IBM doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="6.09">fill the positions we expect IBM US</text>
  <text start="225.53" dur="6.84">employment to be up over that period up</text>
  <text start="229.13" dur="8.61">by what ten a thousand he didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="8.52">say but it&amp;#39;s all a big if and right now</text>
  <text start="237.74" dur="5.46">the sales well they&amp;#39;re not supporting</text>
  <text start="240.89" dur="4.83">all of this retail sales is not</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="6.539">supporting building more stores adding</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="7.17">people we need to go to the heart of the</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="4.981">problem just having companies say listen</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;m going to tax you on the border</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.73">unless you create jobs well guess what</text>
  <text start="257.87" dur="4.53">they could promise everything they</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t even tell they even explain when</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="2.97">the time frame would be oh yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.23" dur="4.74">going to create jobs maybe in the next</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="6.12">ten years yes sunset a little bit sooner</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="5.37">but none of them really nailed down what</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="5.46">along with the flow and until they start</text>
  <text start="277.31" dur="5.58">actually hiring people well it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="5.91">words once again now Trump he assigned</text>
  <text start="282.89" dur="4.589">three executive orders well he ended the</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="4.019">trans-pacific partnership which is good</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="5.311">because we discussed that in length in</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="6.111">other reports he also did a hiring</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="5.73">freeze for the federal government and</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="7.36">the third executive order is limiting</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="7.86">abortion funding overseas so already he</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="5.58">is taking action cutting expenses is</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="5.43">this a good thing what we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="4.89">wait and see he just started now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="4.77">for Trump up not for</text>
  <text start="313.67" dur="4.62">Obama I&amp;#39;m not for Clinton I&amp;#39;m for a</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="4.05">president who&amp;#39;s going to work for the</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="6.96">people not for special interest groups</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="8.49">not for the central bankers not for any</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="6.9">other country because everything they do</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="5.04">in this office the president Congress</text>
  <text start="332.15" dur="6.15">should be for the benefit of the people</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="5.73">period that&amp;#39;s it and these individuals</text>
  <text start="338.3" dur="5.43">who were there should listen to the</text>
  <text start="339.89" dur="6.21">people now what we&amp;#39;re seeing from Trump</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="6.03">is he&amp;#39;s following through on some of his</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="8.46">promises and this is surprising because</text>
  <text start="349.76" dur="6.99">most politicians they really don&amp;#39;t now</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s going to impose a</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="4.73">very major border tax and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="4.95">cut regulation by seventy-five percent</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="4.78">now this is very big we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="364.85" dur="3.3">if he can do that and some are saying</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="3.63">that the World Trade Commission well</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s against the World Trade Commission</text>
  <text start="369.89" dur="4.53">to actually have a border tax so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="3.48">have to see if this is true if he</text>
  <text start="374.42" dur="5.27">actually go through with this he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="6.87">saying he&amp;#39;s going to renegotiate NAFTA</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="6.64">well again a lot of words nothing has</text>
  <text start="383.24" dur="7.4">been done just yet and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="8.49">is that the central bank the elite well</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re going to fight at every turn no</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="4.26">matter what because remember there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="5.64">different agendas going on here here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="6.48">the globalist and then Trump with what</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="6.42">he wants to do now it looks like to me</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="5.19">that Trump is trying to set up the elite</text>
  <text start="408.92" dur="4.89">the central bank saying that I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="4.53">to bring back jobs and we can see that</text>
  <text start="413.81" dur="4.95">he might be doing this and it could be a</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="6.63">lot of a lot of propaganda out there</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="5.37">where he&amp;#39;s trying to push this through</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="4.05">to make everyone you know think that yes</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="4.53">this is what&amp;#39;s happening because he</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="5.19">knows the economy is pretty much dead in</text>
  <text start="428.66" dur="4.97">the water nothing has really changed at</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="5.46">all actually things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="9.3">and you just can&amp;#39;t create jobs out of</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="8.75">thin air if nobody has the funds</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="4.56">purchase those goods and if companies</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="3.39">aren&amp;#39;t making the money well you just</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="2.97">can&amp;#39;t have company saying okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="3.539">going to take out a loan and create</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="3.69">these jobs and we&amp;#39;re going to produce a</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="3.511">product and the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="3.329">there&amp;#39;s still out of work and the debt</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="5.04">keeps getting larger and larger and</text>
  <text start="457.479" dur="4.291">larger it&amp;#39;s not going to work I think we</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="3.03">need to go to the heart of the problem</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="5.429">once again and that is the central bank</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="7.47">that is the debt how this country is run</text>
  <text start="467.199" dur="6.291">from the Federal Reserve how the rest of</text>
  <text start="471.34" dur="6.329">the world is run by the central bank</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="8.489">unless we do that all this stuff is just</text>
  <text start="477.669" dur="8.491">talk because we can see over the years</text>
  <text start="481.979" dur="8.021">what is improved what we have ups and</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="8.96">downs people lose their wealth people</text>
  <text start="490" dur="8.25">lose their pensions but what has really</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="6.669">improved over the years has the value of</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="5.61">the dollar gotten better can you buy the</text>
  <text start="501.789" dur="4.021">same amount as you could have back then</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="6.36">when you had the penny and the dollar</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="7.68">back in 1913 19 / no you can&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="510.22" dur="8.04">the dollars continually losing value so</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="7.229">things are actually getting worse so we</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="6.12">see there are many countries that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.719" dur="6.151">a huge amount of debt now the United</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="4.32">States is not number one they are number</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="4.35">ten they did make the top ten list and</text>
  <text start="528.7" dur="5.24">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="4.77">Americans have been on a borrowing binge</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;ve been firing buying their</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="4.83">favorite cars or trucks and they load it</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="5.16">up on about 1.1 four trillion and auto</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="5.7">loans and we can see right now those</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="5.699">individuals that have student loans</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="5.3">they&amp;#39;re up to 1.2 8 trillion credit card</text>
  <text start="549.459" dur="4.741">is up to about 1.1 two trillion</text>
  <text start="551.82" dur="5.32">mortgages are at eight point eight two</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="8.67">trillion so total household debt is at</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="9.6">12 trillion dollars this is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="5.88">right now the country is swamped in debt</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="5.16">but the first the number one country i</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="6.66">should say is Switzerland 127 point</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="4.869">seven percent of GDP Denmark 123 percent</text>
  <text start="575.41" dur="4.539">Australia 122</text>
  <text start="576.769" dur="5.82">% so when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="579.949" dur="7.471">these countries are in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="582.589" dur="7.081">debt and the debt continually grows now</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="4.56">chiller is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="4.769">warning that the US stock market well</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="5.37">this is based on the Trump effect</text>
  <text start="594.439" dur="6.87">illusion the entire market is based on</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="5.519">illusion and yes it has gone up since</text>
  <text start="601.309" dur="3.09">he&amp;#39;s president because people have hope</text>
  <text start="602.869" dur="3.51">people are thinking that things are</text>
  <text start="604.399" dur="4.521">going to be great and then reality is</text>
  <text start="606.379" dur="6.601">going to set in reality is going to be</text>
  <text start="608.92" dur="6.069">nothing&amp;#39;s changed absolutely nothing has</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="5.419">changed and you just can&amp;#39;t turn this</text>
  <text start="614.989" dur="5.79">economy around on a dime it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="618.399" dur="5.68">especially when you have the debt load</text>
  <text start="620.779" dur="4.98">and interest rates so low I mean think</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="3.48">about all the other countries that have</text>
  <text start="625.759" dur="7.711">this huge amount of debt that we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="627.559" dur="7.74">talking about Finland Spain Greece all</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="6.149">these countries Australia Netherlands</text>
  <text start="635.299" dur="6.9">Canada Norway guess what their interest</text>
  <text start="639.619" dur="6.68">rates are near zero and they have a huge</text>
  <text start="642.199" dur="10.17">amount of debt and the central banks are</text>
  <text start="646.299" dur="8.77">creating currency this is a major</text>
  <text start="652.369" dur="6.121">problem because if interest rates move</text>
  <text start="655.069" dur="8.401">up just a little bit 1% 2% three percent</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="7.469">that&amp;#39;s it these countries are toast now</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="5.789">we see option traders right now they are</text>
  <text start="665.959" dur="8.04">pricing in the third highest chance of a</text>
  <text start="669.259" dur="6.841">Black Swan in crash history and we can</text>
  <text start="673.999" dur="4.291">see right now the skew which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.1" dur="6.179">looking at well this is calculated from</text>
  <text start="678.29" dur="6.539">prices of the sp500 out of the money</text>
  <text start="682.279" dur="5.461">options sku typically ranges from 100 to</text>
  <text start="684.829" dur="5.79">150 ask you value of about a hundred</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="6.209">means that the perceived distribution of</text>
  <text start="690.619" dur="5.25">the sp500 long returns is normal and the</text>
  <text start="693.949" dur="5.97">probability probability of an outlier</text>
  <text start="695.869" dur="8.37">return is therefore negligible as the</text>
  <text start="699.919" dur="6.54">skew rises above 100 the left tail of</text>
  <text start="704.239" dur="4.56">the sp500 distribution acquires more</text>
  <text start="706.459" dur="4.051">weight and the probabilities of outlier</text>
  <text start="708.799" dur="3.931">returns become more sick</text>
  <text start="710.51" dur="5.73">bigint and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="7.74">is that we have asked you which is over</text>
