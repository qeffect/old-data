  <text start="124.399" dur="6.09">Minsk agreements they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="5.34">implement it actually Lavrov was out</text>
  <text start="130.489" dur="4.681">there saying that Kiev is trying to</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="6.12">rewrite the Minsk agreements and he says</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="8.49">this is completely unacceptable and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="8.04">saying that the Normandy for the US</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="5.73">needs to put pressure on Kiev to keep to</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="4.379">the Minsk agreement now we know the US</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="5.04">doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen we know that</text>
  <text start="151.579" dur="4.44">Victoria Nuland it has already stated</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="3.99">that they&amp;#39;re not even going to be</text>
  <text start="156.019" dur="5.22">following the Minsk agreement and we see</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="5.46">already that the u.s. NATO they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.361">there they&amp;#39;re all their training</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="4.68">preparing</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="8.25">getting ready NATO is demanding Russia</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.72">get out of Ukraine or else so we already</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="6.39">have the propaganda heating up at this</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="5.43">point now we know that the EU is there</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="4.65">going to be talking about the sanctions</text>
  <text start="180.71" dur="5.19">on Russia and we know that France</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="3.3">doesn&amp;#39;t want more sanctions many of the</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="2.52">European countries don&amp;#39;t want more</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="3.27">sanctions because it&amp;#39;s really hurting</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="3.54">their economies and they would like to</text>
  <text start="190.46" dur="3.48">get rid of the sanctions but the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="5.43">continually putting pressure on them to</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="6.99">keep the sanctions well in retaliation</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="6.78">to the sanctions Russia had a food</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="6.38">embargo which is hurting the European</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="5.61">countries and right now Russia is</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="4.84">formulating a new list and extending</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="4.98">their food import restrictions until the</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="4.74">end of 2017 and they&amp;#39;re saying listen if</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="4.47">they extend their sanctions we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="5.16">to extend the food embargo and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="4.71">just continue on like this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="10.32">really hurting the European countries</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="11.46">more so than Russia now NATO has said</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="6.9">something very very interesting that</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="7.02">Moscow is seeking to create a zone of</text>
  <text start="239.27" dur="6.47">influence through military means this is</text>
  <text start="242.42" dur="5.97">coming from NATO chief jens stoltenberg</text>
  <text start="245.74" dur="5.83">now you have to listen to what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="5.73">saying here and remember what has</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="4.95">happened we know the US and NATO the</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="4.77">European countries have moved military</text>
  <text start="256.52" dur="6.23">assets troops into the Baltic States</text>
  <text start="258.89" dur="7.11">right up against Russia&amp;#39;s border and</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="7.54">Russia sees this as an aggressive nature</text>
  <text start="266" dur="6.78">so we have NATO moving troops in the</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="6.21">u.s. moving troops into other countries</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="6.44">that border with Russia NATO turns this</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="8.66">around and says that we are observing</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="9.85">massive militarization at NATO borders</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="8.92">wait a minute they&amp;#39;re saying that Russia</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="7.59">is placing and moving military assets</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.59">and troops inside their country which</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="4.44">border the Baltic</text>
  <text start="298.67" dur="5.18">countries where NATO already moved the</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="6.09">troops and the military assets in and</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is just</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="3.48">unbelievable they&amp;#39;re creating a zone of</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="4.71">influence so we have a country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="5.27">moving their military equipment their</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="5.94">personnel inside their own country</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="6.28">meanwhile NATO is in other countries</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="5.04">that border Russia it&amp;#39;s like saying the</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="3.39">United States is moving military</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="4.86">equipment and troops inside their own</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="5.43">country this is not allowed so you can</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="4.5">see how they flip these things around it</text>
  <text start="331.04" dur="5.58">makes no sense Russia is going to be</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="7.95">doing this because NATO came right to</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="6.57">their doorstep if Russia or China took</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="3.96">their military equipment and their</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="4.53">troops and they moved them right up</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="4.11">against the border in Mexico to the</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.62">United States and in Canada brought</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="5.46">chips off the coast of the Atlantic in</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="6.95">the Pacific what would the United States</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="9.48">do the same thing Russia is doing now</text>
  <text start="359.29" dur="8.62">NATO is looking to have a fleet in the</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="6.27">Black Sea former US Navy intelligence</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="5.25">officer captain Steven whore L claims</text>
  <text start="370.85" dur="5.19">that the leadership of NATO they are</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="6.87">hinting at a possible agreement coming</text>
  <text start="376.04" dur="6.48">out of war sore in July about having</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.31">their fleet in Black Sea now of course</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="5.52">the Montreux convention doesn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="6.21">warships to stay in there longer than 21</text>
  <text start="388.04" dur="7.98">days but NATO is looking to get around</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="6.93">this saying that NATO members could</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="5.37">rotate ships into the area on a</text>
  <text start="398.48" dur="5.4">month-to-month basis where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="5.25">continually have ships there so they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="7.32">have one warship in there maybe two</text>
  <text start="406.64" dur="6.95">maybe three 21 days are up another one</text>
  <text start="411.2" dur="4.62">arrives and goes to a different port and</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="3.97">this is what they&amp;#39;re looking to do and</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="4.8">of course this is all against Russian</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="5.75">aggression we see South Korea right now</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="5.25">they are conducting maritime exercises</text>
  <text start="423.31" dur="5.86">because they&amp;#39;re preparing for North</text>

  <text start="436.19" dur="4.29">provoking North Korea they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="3.87">that North Korea does something maybe</text>
  <text start="440.48" dur="5.79">gets very close to one of the other</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="8.91">ships maybe fires upon the ship because</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="6.81">we can see this is their entire plan now</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="4.95">a US official is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="5.31">the Navy intends to send more surface</text>
