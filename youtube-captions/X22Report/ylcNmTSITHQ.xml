  <text start="66.86" dur="3.509">that&amp;#39;s how it started last time if you</text>
  <text start="68.78" dur="3.33">speak to them many of the older folk</text>
  <text start="70.369" dur="3.691">were ordinary people who fell victim to</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="3.99">the banks in the last crash of 2008</text>
  <text start="74.06" dur="3.9">foreclosure and bankruptcy and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="76.1" dur="3.39">never recovered they didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="77.96" dur="3.12">there and they borrowed until they</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="2.669">couldn&amp;#39;t borrow anymore and when it all</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="3.39">went wrong they found themselves</text>
  <text start="82.159" dur="3.931">destitute on the streets the signs are</text>

  <text start="125.27" dur="6.54">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="6.301">we know the Patriots they have a plan to</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="4.83">move forward with a completely different</text>
  <text start="134.81" dur="4.11">economic system than the one the central</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="5.34">banks have planned on and when we look</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="5.49">out in the UK we can see that Boris</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="5.07">Johnson he might be on the exact same</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="6.299">page as Trump and the Patriots and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="6.269">starting to look like he is now Boris</text>
  <text start="150.709" dur="5.341">Johnson he is ready to make a deal with</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="5.461">the EU and when you look closely at the</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="5.609">deal there are agreements within the</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="4.98">agreement and it works in the favor of</text>
  <text start="161.659" dur="6.361">the UK and the US and</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="7.68">the EU so within the agreement as it</text>
  <text start="168.02" dur="6">appears the EU can likely would punish</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.769">the UK for having more favorable trade</text>
  <text start="174.02" dur="5.16">agreements with other nations meaning if</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="4.801">the UK gives better deals to others than</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="4.05">it does the EU the EU will increase</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="4.92">tariffs against the UK intended to</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="6.479">punish UK by restricting access to the</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="6.889">EU market for UK products but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="8.011">limit of what the EU will be able to do</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="7.721">what does that mean the EU cannot stop</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="6.72">the UK from entering a trade deal with</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="6.56">North America think us MCA and there is</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="5.31">very visible likelihood that Trump is</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="6.58">constructing a US UK trade agreement</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="6.54">with that in mind meaning the UK will</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="5.88">have a preferential access to North</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="8.009">America and the US MCA countries which</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="7.5">are Mexico US and Canada and this will</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="6.681">give preferential treatment in trade</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="8.19">also with the UK now this is important</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="7.09">the EU will not be able to influence the</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="5.88">US UK trade room beyond imposing tariffs</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="6.63">on Britain as punishment this is where</text>
  <text start="241.13" dur="6.09">the importance of Trump&amp;#39;s strategy comes</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="5.58">into play he could give preferential</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="5.389">treatment to exports from the UK so long</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="6.36">as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="6.731">reciprocal toward the US Trump can hit</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="4.219">the EU much harder than the EU can hit</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="5.16">Great Britain what do I mean by this</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="5.861">let&amp;#39;s say the EU hits the UK with a 25%</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="4.38">tariff as punishment for a better trade</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.42">deal with the US on any individual</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="7.8">segment Trump can hit the EU with a 25%</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="6.66">tariff back on the EU the EU needs</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.34">access to the 20 trillion u.s. market</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="5.339">much more than the EU needs access to</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="6.149">the newly freed UK market brexit ears</text>
  <text start="285.139" dur="4.951">should remember this Trump and Johnson</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="5.071">can work together to leverage this trade</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="4.949">situation to both of their benefits the</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="3.18">EU will want to keep selling their stuff</text>
  <text start="295.039" dur="3.841">into the UK</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="5.76">but the EU has to keep selling their</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="6.3">stuff into the u.s. in order to survive</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="6.09">Trump and Johnson can work on a US UK</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="6.6">trade superhighway and Trump he can</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="7.53">pummel EU with tariffs remember what</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="7.59">happened recently the u.s. won a World</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="6.27">Trade Organization ruling for 7.5</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="6.86">billion a year in countervailing duties</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="7.98">the EU cannot legally try and counteract</text>
  <text start="326.23" dur="5.26">combine the 7.5 billion WTO ruling with</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="3.78">the potential for President Trump to</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="4.68">hammer additional duties against the EU</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="4.53">for adverse trade action within the</text>
  <text start="336.17" dur="5.73">brexit customs authority and what you</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="6.27">see is an EU that can threaten action</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="7.71">but has limited recourse just like China</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="9.42">right now Trump is pulling the trigger</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="6.21">and pushing the EU to exactly where he</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="5.37">wants them to be and it looks like</text>
  <text start="355.82" dur="6.12">Johnson is on board with this and yes</text>
  <text start="359.42" dur="3.99">the outer lying agreement seems like yes</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="5.34">this is the same deal as Theresa May</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="9.21">which it is but underneath it all it</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="10.59">allows the UK to move past and away from</text>
  <text start="372.62" dur="6.99">the EU and deal with the u.s. this is</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="4.65">why despite the flaws inherent with the</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="5.13">UK EU brags agreement it would be in the</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="4.92">best interest of the UK to vote in</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="6">support of the current deal and get out</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="7.35">and I believe this is why Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="7.02">is pushing this so hard now here in the</text>
  <text start="394.79" dur="5.16">US Trump put out the idea that the g7</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="5.64">meeting would be hosted in his Florida</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="5.52">Gulf resort at no profit Honda the deeps</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="5.1">to hate the mainstream media they went</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="5.46">completely bonkers over this Trump</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="4.2">tweeted out the following I thought I</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="3.81">was doing something very good for a</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="4.95">country by using Trump national Doral in</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="5.97">Miami for hosting the g7 leaders it is</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="4.83">big grin on hundreds of acres next to</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="3.9">Miami International Airport has</text>
  <text start="422.48" dur="4.64">tremendous ballrooms and meeting rooms</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="4.68">and each delegation would have its own</text>
  <text start="427.12" dur="3.76">5270 unit building</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="3.69">would set up better than other</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="6.3">alternatives I announced that I would be</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="7.41">willing to do it at no profit or if</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="6.27">legally permissible at zero cost to the</text>
  <text start="440.39" dur="7.26">US but as usual the hostile media and</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="5.64">the Democrat partners went crazy so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="3.57">saying listen this won&amp;#39;t cost us</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="6.74">anything I&amp;#39;m not gonna make any profit</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="7.44">on this zero zilch nothing guess what</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="5.17">the mainstream e to the deep state they</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t want Trump having any type of</text>
  <text start="461" dur="5.37">upper hand and of course they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3">a really big deal out of this and it</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="4.2">really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="6.18">but again Trump never does these type of</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="5.73">things unless there is some type of plan</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="4.29">behind all of this and of course as we</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="3.33">know the deep state that makes Remini</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="3.93">the man crazy of this so Trump is got</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="4.38">most likely going to announce that okay</text>
  <text start="481.64" dur="3.81">we found a new location it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="484.01" dur="3.42">cost the American taxpayers</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="3.72">I don&amp;#39;t know 1 million 9 million 10</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="3.9">million 50 million whatever the number</text>
  <text start="489.17" dur="3.42">is and he&amp;#39;s gonna say this is what the</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="3.33">mainstream media want this is what the</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="5.36">deep state wanted they wanted the</text>
  <text start="494.66" dur="6.45">g-seven economic meeting held here for</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="6.76">the cost that will go to the American</text>
  <text start="501.11" dur="7.35">taxpayer and if we had it at the doral</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="5.58">Club it would be zero so because of a</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="3.36">because they made this really big deal</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="3">about this whole thing it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="511.82" dur="5.22">cost millions and millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="513.29" dur="7.62">instead of doing it for zero who&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="517.04" dur="6.15">to look better in the end of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.91" dur="6.3">going to be Trump again Trump is</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="6.15">exposing all of these individuals now</text>
  <text start="527.21" dur="4.29">the central bank they&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="529.34" dur="4.11">nervous about what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.2">doing they see what&amp;#39;s happening and</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="4.44">we said they would push the idea that</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="4.11">the trade wars are the problem around</text>
  <text start="540.14" dur="3.54">the world and what do we see we see the</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="4.68">central bank governors and finance</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="6.96">ministers and they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="6.84">that there are many economies that are</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="4.95">suffering because of the trade wars they</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="4.17">said the damage is being particularly</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="4.98">felt in European countries which rely on</text>
  <text start="557.81" dur="3.38">exports and are open to trade but are</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="3.56">they really</text>
  <text start="561.19" dur="5.79">open a trade think about the EU think</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="6.69">about the central bank&amp;#39;s system and</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="6.72">every time Trump hits their system with</text>
  <text start="570.82" dur="4.86">free and open trade it hurts their</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="3.9">system and the same thing that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="3.93">doing with China where he&amp;#39;s pushing them</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="4.44">into a corner to have free and open</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.38">trade a balance trade this is going to</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="4.11">hurt the central bank system and we are</text>
  <text start="583.99" dur="4.62">definitely seeing this now was very</text>
  <text start="586.15" dur="4.41">interesting Trump has been out there and</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s been criticizing the Fed quite</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="3.66">often every time the stock market&amp;#39;s goes</text>
  <text start="592.06" dur="3.78">down or the economic numbers don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="4.05">good he hits the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="595.84" dur="3.57">says listen if we were on an even</text>
  <text start="598.27" dur="3">playing field with the rest of the</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="3.9">countries lowering the interest rates</text>
  <text start="601.27" dur="3.39">starting stimulus we&amp;#39;d be doing a lot</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="3.98">better the stock market would be going</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="4.8">up now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="607.29" dur="3.7">Christine Lagarde who was the head of</text>
  <text start="609.46" dur="5.46">the IMF now is going to be the head of</text>

  <text start="621.31" dur="6">they don&amp;#39;t work a lot better it just</text>
  <text start="623.77" dur="7.22">means they call the shots Trump now is</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="6.39">calling the shots Lagarde is saying that</text>
  <text start="630.99" dur="5.02">Trump needs to stop this she criticized</text>
  <text start="633.7" dur="4.5">Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter practices as a whole and</text>

  <text start="638.2" dur="3.63">the global economy into one of its most</text>
  <text start="639.97" dur="4.41">vulnerable periods since the last</text>
  <text start="641.83" dur="5.1">financial crisis now is that really the</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="4.56">reason why the entire global economic</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="5.22">system is falling apart it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="5.1">Trump&amp;#39;s trade wars and is because of him</text>
  <text start="652.15" dur="2.67">criticizing the central bank no of</text>
  <text start="654.04" dur="3.06">course not</text>
  <text start="654.82" dur="5.48">remember the central bank they were</text>
  <text start="657.1" dur="5.64">afraid that people will start to realize</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="5.02">countries and the people in the</text>
  <text start="662.74" dur="4.74">countries will start to realize what</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="5.79">they have been doing for a very long</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="7.68">time keeping the countries the people in</text>
  <text start="671.11" dur="6.75">the dark pushing their agenda by putting</text>
  <text start="675.16" dur="6.99">all countries into debt and controlling</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="8.3">countries by pushing austerity on these</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="7.08">countries enslaving the people and</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="5.83">profiting at the same time when</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="4.13">Christine Lagarde was the president of</text>
  <text start="691.99" dur="5.55">the IMF</text>
  <text start="693.36" dur="7.72">she had a failed 57 billion bailout of</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="6.2">Argentina through an IMF loan and it has</text>
  <text start="701.08" dur="5.07">left the country a 45 million</text>
  <text start="703.74" dur="4.54">essentially bankrupt but more</text>
  <text start="706.15" dur="6.24">importantly it shows that she will</text>
  <text start="708.28" dur="6.51">destroy the eurozone as the ECB head but</text>
  <text start="712.39" dur="6.09">this is what central banks do they</text>
  <text start="714.79" dur="7.22">destroy countries while they pretend</text>
  <text start="718.48" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re helping them how do they do this</text>
  <text start="722.01" dur="5.65">well since they have to borrow money</text>
  <text start="724.93" dur="5.82">over and over and over in countries get</text>
  <text start="727.66" dur="5.22">into debt they tell the countries this</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="4.62">is what we need you to do we need you to</text>
  <text start="732.88" dur="5.04">enact these laws we need you to place</text>
  <text start="735.37" dur="3.99">austerity on the people this way we can</text>
  <text start="737.92" dur="4.67">make things better for you because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="739.36" dur="6">your fault that you put yourself in debt</text>
  <text start="742.59" dur="5.65">now remember the system becomes corrupt</text>
  <text start="745.36" dur="6.63">because you can borrow unlimited funds</text>
  <text start="748.24" dur="6.36">and the corrupt want to borrow even more</text>
  <text start="751.99" dur="5.28">the central bank corrupts many</text>
  <text start="754.6" dur="5.37">individuals within government there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="757.27" dur="5.13">checks and balances and of course what</text>
  <text start="759.97" dur="4.2">is the central banks do they tell the</text>
  <text start="762.4" dur="4.02">countries listen this is what you need</text>
  <text start="764.17" dur="4.95">to do you need to push austerity in your</text>
  <text start="766.42" dur="5.55">country and then it hurts the people and</text>
  <text start="769.12" dur="6.33">then you&amp;#39;ll be allowed to borrow even</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="5.49">more this is how they play the game most</text>
  <text start="775.45" dur="4.35">of the funds completely disappear</text>
  <text start="777.46" dur="5.22">remember the central banks they could</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="6.66">care less about their Fiat paper system</text>
  <text start="782.68" dur="5.22">they only care about hard assets why do</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="3.54">you think the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="787.9" dur="5.22">ramping up on gold because they know</text>
  <text start="790" dur="5.16">their fiat system is coming to an end if</text>
  <text start="793.12" dur="4.26">their feel system was so great they</text>
  <text start="795.16" dur="3.54">wouldn&amp;#39;t need the gold but they need the</text>
  <text start="797.38" dur="3.09">goal because when their fiat system</text>
  <text start="798.7" dur="5.34">comes to an end they need to fall back</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="5.82">on their gold reserves to show the</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="5.19">population once they blame it on someone</text>
  <text start="806.29" dur="5.85">else that we&amp;#39;re are now a sound system</text>
  <text start="809.23" dur="4.95">and they need to build confidence but</text>
  <text start="812.14" dur="3.449">the problem here is they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="814.18" dur="3.75">these events this is why Christine</text>
  <text start="815.589" dur="4.051">Lagarde this is why the central bank</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="3.54">system is getting very very nervous this</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="4.41">is why they&amp;#39;re pointing the finger at</text>
  <text start="821.47" dur="5.589">Trump and his trade war and him</text>
  <text start="824.05" dur="7.299">criticizing the Fed these attacks will</text>
  <text start="827.059" dur="7.98">intensify overtime as Trump rips apart</text>
  <text start="831.349" dur="6.06">the central banking apparatus and once</text>
  <text start="835.039" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s completely exposed the attacks are</text>
  <text start="837.409" dur="3.84">going to be off the chart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.049" dur="4.02">going to see this happen</text>
  <text start="841.249" dur="5.07">in 2020 everything that we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="844.069" dur="4.46">right now is leading up to 2020 and then</text>
  <text start="846.319" dur="5.51">after 2020 once Trump is president an</text>
  <text start="848.529" dur="7.09">elected president once again guess what</text>
  <text start="851.829" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s game over because there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="855.619" dur="4.59">holding them back at this time and why</text>
  <text start="857.719" dur="5.52">do you think they&amp;#39;re trying so hard to</text>
  <text start="860.209" dur="4.65">remove him this is the reason this is</text>
  <text start="863.239" dur="3.36">why the central banks have started their</text>
  <text start="864.859" dur="4.74">attacks about the trade wars because</text>
  <text start="866.599" dur="5.55">they need something to blame this global</text>
  <text start="869.599" dur="4.8">economic meltdown on and this is all</text>
  <text start="872.149" dur="4.71">they have but again what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="874.399" dur="5.31">happen just like it happens every single</text>
  <text start="876.859" dur="6.21">other time Trump is going to turn the</text>
  <text start="879.709" dur="5.79">tables on them and he&amp;#39;s going to make a</text>
  <text start="883.069" dur="4.86">deal with China is it gonna be this year</text>
  <text start="885.499" dur="4.8">most likely not he&amp;#39;ll probably end up</text>
  <text start="887.929" dur="5.76">happening in 2020 and then what happens</text>
  <text start="890.299" dur="5.94">well essential banks at that point have</text>
  <text start="893.689" dur="5.49">nothing to hide behind they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="896.239" dur="5.04">the trade wars Trump controls the Fed</text>
  <text start="899.179" dur="4.17">he&amp;#39;s showing that they are doing</text>

  <text start="915.559" dur="4.62">against them these are all manipulative</text>
