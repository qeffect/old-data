  <text start="53.26" dur="5.04">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.98" dur="5.07">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.3" dur="7.01">episode 1633 and today&amp;#39;s date is August</text>
  <text start="62.05" dur="5.52">8th 2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.31" dur="5.919">confused on what&amp;#39;s happening with the</text>
  <text start="67.57" dur="5.79">economy don&amp;#39;t be this is the plan let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.229" dur="4.291">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.36" dur="4.35">news now today i just wanted to break</text>
  <text start="75.52" dur="5.489">down what is happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="77.71" dur="5.4">and the plan to blame this all on the</text>
  <text start="81.009" dur="5.191">fed and i want to go back in time a</text>
  <text start="83.11" dur="5.22">little bit here to 2008 then moving</text>
  <text start="86.2" dur="5.22">forward to understand what is happening</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="4.73">here now since 2008 you need to remember</text>
  <text start="91.42" dur="4.71">we were in this great recession</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="4.75">everything crashed credit froze up the</text>
  <text start="96.13" dur="5.97">government had to step in to bail out</text>
  <text start="97.81" dur="6.809">the banks corporations because if they</text>
  <text start="102.1" dur="4.59">didn&amp;#39;t everything would have imploded at</text>
  <text start="104.619" dur="2.64">that point and they didn&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="106.69" dur="2.429">happen</text>
  <text start="107.259" dur="4.2">they wanted their system to continue on</text>
  <text start="109.119" dur="5.551">so what they did was and they figured it</text>
  <text start="111.459" dur="5.041">out back then well if we&amp;#39;re allowed to</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="4.259">create currency and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="116.5" dur="6.06">the central bank we can prop up the</text>
  <text start="118.929" dur="6.75">banks if we can get government to allow</text>
  <text start="122.56" dur="4.979">us to do this well we would have a lot</text>
  <text start="125.679" dur="4.83">more freedom to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="127.539" dur="5.041">because remember a central bank fiat</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.7">system only lasts for a certain period</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="7.17">of time usually 40 to 45 years and then</text>
  <text start="136.209" dur="5.341">it collapses from the debt level it</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="4.379">cannot be sustained it&amp;#39;s designed this</text>
  <text start="141.55" dur="4.59">way it&amp;#39;s designed to steal all the</text>
  <text start="144.129" dur="5.161">wealth from everyone and at the last</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.069">stage you collapse it but you cover it</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="3.75">up with an event like war or something</text>
  <text start="151.209" dur="4.051">like that to say hey this is why you</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="4.26">need to sacrifice this is why we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="4.559">have food on the shelves because we are</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="5.46">in war but really it had to do with the</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="5.31">economy not supporting every single</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="4.259">person throughout the world because the</text>
  <text start="165.129" dur="3.78">system cannot be sustained in after the</text>
  <text start="167.019" dur="3.711">war after everything is reduced like</text>
  <text start="168.909" dur="4.41">population and everything else</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="4.39">governments would then borrow money to</text>
  <text start="173.319" dur="3.571">rebuild the central bank would restart</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="5.28">the system groups would come together</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="6.81">and create a brand new type of system</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="6.149">make a currency become the reserve</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="3.36">currency of the world and this is what</text>
  <text start="186.549" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="5.37">in the past but what we&amp;#39;ve seen here is</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="4.29">they kept the system going a little bit</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="4.41">longer and they started to manipulate</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="4.95">the data they started to manipulate</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="6.18">everything because the last end stage of</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="6.54">this system that were in he in today was</text>
  <text start="203.02" dur="5.219">to bring us into a one-world government</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="4.86">and they needed certain things in place</text>
  <text start="208.239" dur="4.891">first and this is why you saw these</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="4.949">trade deals this is why you see you saw</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="4.02">a TPP this is why you saw all this</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="2.431">because they were trying to get the last</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="3.6">part of it</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.41">in place and this is why you saw the</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="3.48">refugees moving into all these different</text>
  <text start="222.58" dur="3.45">countries to blend the countries to make</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="4.71">them all the same this is why you saw</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.459">the illegals coming into the US and</text>
  <text start="228.94" dur="4.62">there were certain agendas associated</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="3.841">with this the biggest one was eventually</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="3.69">what was going to happen is they were</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.71">going to have to bring all these</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="4.44">countries to a level playing field so</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="4.71">some of the countries that were you know</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="4.799">making a lot of money they the workers</text>
  <text start="244.75" dur="4.68">were making a lot of money you had to</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="7.711">bring the way of life down to even it</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="7.02">all out this was the plan and then it</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="4.08">got interrupted they thought the next</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="4.89">leader was going to be put in place most</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="5.61">likely Clinton and they thought okay</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re on track we&amp;#39;re gonna be pushing</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="4.41">this forward the TPP would be passed</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;d have a court system above each and</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="4.83">every government we would have a a</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="4.86">one-world system where we control all</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="4.009">these different governments through debt</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="5.19">and having a court system above</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="5.861">government to instruct them in what to</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.29">do and we&amp;#39;d be able to blend all the</text>
  <text start="283" dur="3.69">countries together bring everyone down</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="3.93">to a certain level and we can trade</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="3.75">workers back and forth and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="4.2">expect to make more money or anything</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="4.44">like that well the whole thing</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="4.5">completely fell apart and that was the</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.82">introduction of Trump now they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="6.479">trouble they don&amp;#39;t know what to do and</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="5.469">to undo all of this which they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="2.731">doing for a very long time and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="4.981">talking about the deep State the central</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.82">bank to undo all of this well there had</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="5.519">to be drastic measures put into place</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="7.62">and to do all of this</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="7.201">you needed to prop the u.s. back</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="5.01">up and this is what we see happening</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="5.76">right now but it&amp;#39;s not to prop it up</text>
  <text start="324.91" dur="5.91">right now to make it work again under</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="5.46">the Central Bank rule that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="5.58">point of it so in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="4.049">you saw the TPP it was struck down</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="4.38">because we&amp;#39;re not going in that</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="4.981">direction you saw the president make a</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.8">lot of bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="3.96">different countries NAFTA&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="3.839">negotiations because it was so</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="5.61">intertwined that Congress would have to</text>
  <text start="349.419" dur="5.091">vote on this to remove it so they</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="3.75">decided to they started to negotiate</text>
  <text start="354.51" dur="4.6">NAFTA and of course it hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="356.44" dur="4.17">gone anywhere because they&amp;#39;ve put these</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="4.589">things into place to make it very</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="6.15">difficult to get out of and you saw out</text>
  <text start="363.699" dur="4.801">in England where they voted for a brexit</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="4.71">which is also having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="368.5" dur="5.15">time so we saw all this happening and</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="4.259">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.48">doing something completely different</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="5.19">than the central bankers wanted then all</text>
  <text start="378.13" dur="5.789">of a sudden you saw it tariffs because</text>
  <text start="380.919" dur="5.041">remember what were the central bankers</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="5.401">doing what was the deep state doing all</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="7.29">this time they were taking the wealth</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="6.48">from the US and moving it outside of the</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="4.02">US and if you look back in time you can</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="3.839">see manufacturing was moved away</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="5.25">companies moved away everything was</text>
  <text start="399.639" dur="5.041">being moved away or offloaded into other</text>
  <text start="402.52" dur="4.95">countries where they would produce the</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="5.58">goods so that brings us back to tariffs</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="4.05">so Trump was making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="5.46">agreements really doesn&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="6.269">central organization to create trade</text>
  <text start="415.72" dur="4.02">wanted to have trade with each and every</text>
  <text start="417.789" dur="5.071">one of these countries this way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="6.359">diversified and also started to put in</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="6.239">place tariffs to make it an even playing</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="5.461">field because we were being robbed now</text>
  <text start="429.099" dur="4.921">the central bankers on the other hand</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="4.5">looked at this and said okay great he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="4.98">putting together tariffs the IMF came</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="4.8">out with a warning that if these tariffs</text>
  <text start="439" dur="4.86">continue its going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="4.95">economy the central bankers the Biz the</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="3.839">rest all came out with the same exact</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="4.46">morning saying that this continues the</text>
  <text start="447.699" dur="4.201">global economy will suffer things will</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="3.25">implode on itself</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="3.54">we saw financial</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="3.84">London&amp;#39;s out there saying all these</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="4.8">tariffs are going to implode the economy</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="4.83">now they were setting it up where they</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="3.959">thought oh if he puts these tariffs in</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="3.81">place we know the power of the central</text>
  <text start="464.199" dur="3.96">bank we know what they can do they can</text>
  <text start="466" dur="4.56">bring the economy down and it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="468.159" dur="5.551">blamed on Trump this was the central</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="5.039">bankers strategy meanwhile while Trump</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="3.69">was doing all this putting all this into</text>
  <text start="475.599" dur="4.201">place and putting these tariffs into</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.34">place and canceling the TPP we</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="4.679">negotiating the NAFTA deal and making it</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="6.95">a little bit more of an even playing</text>
  <text start="484.479" dur="8.461">field his plan and not just him alone</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="8.05">the Patriots plan was completely</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="10.14">different it was to push this economy to</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="6.48">the edge and make it crash now they</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for the crash</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="5.819">they want the blame to be on the central</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="5.58">bank&amp;#39;s so the news started out if you</text>
  <text start="510.039" dur="4.38">remember the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="4.38">look at real estate it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="3.66">Trump&amp;#39;s economic policies and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="3.6">just his policies there&amp;#39;s other people</text>
  <text start="518.079" dur="5.611">behind it and it&amp;#39;s going to bring down</text>
  <text start="520.3" dur="5.76">the economy and then all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="6.57">GDP numbers came in four percent</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="7.469">unemployment kept on going down and all</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="5.43">of a sudden the economy looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.529" dur="5.071">doing better than ever people have more</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="3.33">savings GDP has doubled savings rate has</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="1.89">doubled</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="3.87">unemployment&amp;#39;s going to be dropping to</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="6.719">three percent eventually as they keep</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="6.24">going and the corporate media they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.209" dur="4.771">know how to explain this because one</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="4.74">minute ago they were talking about how</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="4.14">the tariffs are going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="3.39">economy the IMF was out there saying how</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="4.589">the tariffs are going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="557.26" dur="4.079">economy and now everything looks better</text>
  <text start="560.709" dur="4.591">than ever</text>
  <text start="561.339" dur="6.211">GDP 4% some say might even go to 5%</text>
  <text start="565.3" dur="5.37">unemployment the lowest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="5.25">it people are getting off food stamps</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="7.02">this whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="7.02">very confusing the plan is to trick the</text>
  <text start="577.69" dur="4.56">central banks to trick the mainstream</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.889">media almost like North Korea where you</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="4.92">think something&amp;#39;s happening but behind</text>
  <text start="584.709" dur="6.18">the scenes other things are happening</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="8.55">now remember what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="9.031">to push the central bank into doing</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="6.959">something so they&amp;#39;re to blame for the</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="4.919">crash so if the economy is really doing</text>
  <text start="602.679" dur="5.46">well in the central bank over many many</text>
  <text start="604.839" dur="5.011">months have been saying we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="608.139" dur="3.06">raise the rates if the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="4.109">comes down we&amp;#39;re gonna raise the rates</text>
  <text start="611.199" dur="4.41">if we see inflation ticking up this is</text>
  <text start="613.959" dur="4.98">fantastic we&amp;#39;re gonna raise the rates if</text>
  <text start="615.609" dur="6.69">GDP is better and you start to see all</text>
  <text start="618.939" dur="6.36">this happen now the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="622.299" dur="4.83">well since they&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="625.299" dur="4.83">this all along and they&amp;#39;ve been raising</text>
  <text start="627.129" dur="6.95">the rates they&amp;#39;re gonna have to continue</text>
  <text start="630.129" dur="5.851">this Trump put it out there that hey I</text>
  <text start="634.079" dur="6.79">don&amp;#39;t think you should be raising the</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="7.349">rates but you do what&amp;#39;s best now he set</text>
  <text start="640.869" dur="4.47">them up this whole thing is a setup now</text>
  <text start="643.329" dur="3.72">yes there are people out there really</text>
  <text start="645.339" dur="5.28">thinking that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="647.049" dur="5.88">this is part of the plan the illusion to</text>
  <text start="650.619" dur="4.95">make everyone believe that Trump has</text>
  <text start="652.929" dur="4.65">created this in this economy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="655.569" dur="3.42">better than ever it&amp;#39;s screaming right</text>
  <text start="657.579" dur="3.031">now but if you look at all the</text>
  <text start="658.989" dur="3.18">fundamentals and everything behind it</text>
  <text start="660.61" dur="3.539">nothing&amp;#39;s really changed all they did</text>
  <text start="662.169" dur="3.21">was change the system these statistical</text>
  <text start="664.149" dur="3.42">numbers that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve done that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.379" dur="6.031">all I&amp;#39;ve done right now nothing else has</text>
  <text start="667.569" dur="7.55">changed at all but we don&amp;#39;t have new</text>
  <text start="671.41" dur="6.359">plants coming in and more of the</text>
  <text start="675.119" dur="4.96">manufacturing moving out of China</text>
  <text start="677.769" dur="3.54">out of Korea out of all these other</text>
  <text start="680.079" dur="3.06">countries moving back to the United</text>
  <text start="681.309" dur="4.53">States we don&amp;#39;t see that as of yet and</text>
  <text start="683.139" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s not going to be that easy you just</text>
  <text start="685.839" dur="4.891">can&amp;#39;t take everything that was changed</text>
  <text start="689.169" dur="4.11">by the central bank in the deep state</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="4.5">and just flip it around in a year and a</text>
  <text start="693.279" dur="5.701">half that&amp;#39;s quite impossible it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="695.23" dur="7.319">going to happen so you can see what is</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="5.49">happening here there&amp;#39;s an illusion going</text>
  <text start="702.549" dur="5.91">on that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well and</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="5.729">it&amp;#39;s being done on purpose to force the</text>
  <text start="708.459" dur="2.88">central bank and again remember we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="710.199" dur="3.33">been talking about who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="711.339" dur="4.98">control the narrative it&amp;#39;s to force the</text>
  <text start="713.529" dur="5.16">central bank into raising the rates and</text>
  <text start="716.319" dur="3.541">if we go back to two thousand five six</text>
  <text start="718.689" dur="4.14">seven you can</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="4.56">see what the central bank did back then</text>
  <text start="722.829" dur="3.63">as soon as they hit a certain point</text>
  <text start="724.42" dur="4.08">everything started to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="3.931">they knew what was going to happen and</text>
  <text start="728.5" dur="3.899">they crashed the economy why because</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="5.31">they knew they were they were going to</text>
  <text start="732.399" dur="6.06">need to print money like there was no</text>
  <text start="735.7" dur="5.73">tomorrow and the only way to do this was</text>
  <text start="738.459" dur="6.901">to crash the economy and show that the</text>
  <text start="741.43" dur="7.32">economy needs this they need to pass a</text>
  <text start="745.36" dur="6.45">bill where it allows the Fed to do</text>
  <text start="748.75" dur="5.7">things they&amp;#39;ve never done before but</text>
  <text start="751.81" dur="5.94">here we are today this time is going to</text>
  <text start="754.45" dur="5.34">be completely different because this</text>
  <text start="757.75" dur="4.8">time the narrative is not going to be</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="4.739">owned by the central bank the narrative</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="4.56">is going to be owned by Trump in the</text>
  <text start="764.529" dur="4.56">Patriots and Trump is not going to crash</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="6.479">the economy he&amp;#39;s gonna force the central</text>
  <text start="769.089" dur="7.68">bank to crash the economy because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="773.589" dur="6.631">happening here is he&amp;#39;s showing the world</text>
  <text start="776.769" dur="6.271">look how great the US economy is doing</text>
  <text start="780.22" dur="5.22">right now look at our GDP numbers look</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="5.669">at our unemployment numbers look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="785.44" dur="7.519">happening here so with the economy doing</text>
  <text start="788.709" dur="9.951">so well with NAFTA being renegotiated</text>
  <text start="792.959" dur="9.041">TPP struck down bilateral trades tariffs</text>
  <text start="798.66" dur="7.33">how in the world is the economy going to</text>
  <text start="802" dur="8.55">collapse under Trump from his and the</text>
  <text start="805.99" dur="9.45">Patriots economic policies it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="810.55" dur="7.38">impossible isn&amp;#39;t it so on one side we</text>
  <text start="815.44" dur="5.1">have Trump and the Patriots showing the</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="3.71">economy is stronger than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="820.54" dur="5.64">it before</text>
  <text start="821.64" dur="8.17">now he wants the central bank the Fed to</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="6.839">do what they do best raise your rates</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="7.11">why because you know what&amp;#39;s best for the</text>
  <text start="833.019" dur="6.57">economy he said this he set them up so</text>
  <text start="836.92" dur="5.37">now the Fed is going to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="839.589" dur="4.771">now remember to make the economy strong</text>
  <text start="842.29" dur="5.659">yes there&amp;#39;s going to be defense spending</text>
  <text start="844.36" dur="7.44">actually that&amp;#39;s on purpose because the</text>
  <text start="847.949" dur="5.411">US forces have been weakened for a very</text>
  <text start="851.8" dur="4.469">long time because</text>
  <text start="853.36" dur="5.4">once we were under the control of the UN</text>
  <text start="856.269" dur="4.201">and all the deep state actors and</text>
  <text start="858.76" dur="4.139">central bank&amp;#39;s they didn&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="860.47" dur="5.549">fighting force they wanted a weakened</text>
  <text start="862.899" dur="5.101">military that was on purpose and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.019" dur="4.621">not building the military up to go</text>
  <text start="868" dur="7.35">invade countries building the military</text>
  <text start="870.64" dur="8.16">up to protect the u.s. from the deep</text>
  <text start="875.35" dur="6.69">state from the intelligence agencies to</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="7.5">protect from outside or inside forces</text>
  <text start="882.04" dur="5.88">not to invade very big difference now</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="3.93">again there&amp;#39;s going to be deep state</text>
  <text start="887.92" dur="6.479">actors outside of the country it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="890.23" dur="8.49">protect against those also so with this</text>
  <text start="894.399" dur="6.481">economy so strong Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="898.72" dur="5.369">wants the fed and is trying to force the</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="5.459">fed into raising the rates as quickly as</text>
  <text start="904.089" dur="2.821">possible they don&amp;#39;t have to raise them</text>
  <text start="906.339" dur="2.551">that much</text>
  <text start="906.91" dur="3.299">everyone&amp;#39;s projecting around three</text>
  <text start="908.89" dur="3.27">percent or so and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="910.209" dur="3.81">everything will start to crash down now</text>
  <text start="912.16" dur="3.27">the central bank they realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.019" dur="3.151">happening here they understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.43" dur="3.57">going on and it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="917.17" dur="5.55">difficult for them to argue their way</text>
  <text start="919" dur="5.37">out of this and they know it and we can</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="5.549">see that this is going to be a battle</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="5.339">until the end now remember don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="928.269" dur="4.921">confused because the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="929.709" dur="7.011">well go back prior to 2008 how well was</text>
  <text start="933.19" dur="6.42">the economy doing everyone had a job</text>
  <text start="936.72" dur="5.08">unemployment was pretty darn low and I</text>
  <text start="939.61" dur="3.659">don&amp;#39;t mean every single person yes there</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="4.38">were still people unemployed but the</text>
  <text start="943.269" dur="6.391">unemployment rate was very very low real</text>
  <text start="946.18" dur="6.08">estate was skyrocketing the stock market</text>
  <text start="949.66" dur="4.47">was hitting all-time new highs and</text>
  <text start="952.26" dur="3.73">everyone thought it was never going to</text>
  <text start="954.13" dur="5.399">end I mean if you remember the big short</text>
  <text start="955.99" dur="5.87">what did they do they shorted the house</text>
  <text start="959.529" dur="4.92">they shorted the subprime security</text>
  <text start="961.86" dur="4.93">market because they looked inside and</text>
  <text start="964.449" dur="6.181">said this is all garbage and everyone</text>
  <text start="966.79" dur="6.239">laughed at them because they thought why</text>
  <text start="970.63" dur="6.329">would this system that&amp;#39;s doing so great</text>
  <text start="973.029" dur="6.541">ever fail housing will never go down</text>
  <text start="976.959" dur="7.351">they&amp;#39;ll never collect on this stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="979.57" dur="7.38">rated triple-a just because statistics</text>
  <text start="984.31" dur="5.1">and rating agencies are</text>
  <text start="986.95" dur="3.36">telling you something it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="989.41" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="990.31" dur="8.01">it means they created an illusion Q has</text>
  <text start="994.63" dur="7.11">always told us enjoy the show this is a</text>
  <text start="998.32" dur="4.95">show I mean right now if Jeff Trump just</text>
  <text start="1001.74" dur="4.14">came out and said to everyone hey listen</text>
  <text start="1003.27" dur="6.93">by the way all these years the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1005.88" dur="8.76">fake its phony and if we really look at</text>
  <text start="1010.2" dur="7.08">the real numbers unemployment 18% GDP is</text>
  <text start="1014.64" dur="5.07">negative five percent or negative you</text>
  <text start="1017.28" dur="5.13">know 0.5 or 1.5 percent whatever the</text>
  <text start="1019.71" dur="4.2">number is what would happen it would</text>
  <text start="1022.41" dur="4.23">just collapse on its own and who would</text>
  <text start="1023.91" dur="6.12">to blame he would because he went out in</text>
  <text start="1026.64" dur="7.26">there and told everyone you need to push</text>
  <text start="1030.03" dur="6.78">this in a certain way to get those who</text>
  <text start="1033.9" dur="5.28">created this system out of the picture</text>
  <text start="1036.81" dur="5.94">and this is why Trump has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="1039.18" dur="6.63">hanging on the wall in his office this</text>
  <text start="1042.75" dur="6.36">is the end stage of everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
