  <text start="55.949" dur="5.311">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="7.079">episode 1528 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="6.48">23rd 2018 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="7.441">is everything is in play bailouts</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="6.03">bailing it&amp;#39;s all coming down let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72" dur="4.71">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.77" dur="6.959">news well it looks like things are not</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="7.23">going well with the brexit and we know</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="6.78">that the people of the UK decided they</text>
  <text start="83.94" dur="5.879">don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of the European</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="5.61">system and he decided to vote themselves</text>
  <text start="89.819" dur="5.791">away and right now the eurozone banks</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="6.691">they&amp;#39;re preparing for a hard breast</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="5.789">brexit even though they condemned a no</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="3.63">teel exit they said they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="101.399" dur="3.42">do it&amp;#39;s the worst case scenario but</text>
  <text start="103.44" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.819" dur="5.491">not going to come to any type of deal</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="7.13">and they&amp;#39;re already making preparations</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="6.809">to basically have a no deal exit and</text>
  <text start="114.44" dur="4.69">what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.68">the brags that the hard brexit is going</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.129">to happen in March of 2019 where they</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="5.67">really wanted a softer brexit back which</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="5.881">we December 2020 and this way they can</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="4.8">lay out everything and both agree on</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="5.069">different issues but we see at this</text>
  <text start="132.269" dur="6.361">point that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="135.209" dur="6.361">never want any country to leave their</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="5.34">system once you&amp;#39;re in you&amp;#39;re in and</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="4.5">trying to get out they make it as</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="5.13">difficult as possible and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="146.07" dur="6">see how this moves forward but we can</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="4.77">see at this point in time that the UK is</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="5.669">looking to remove itself</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="5.459">they already voted on it and the central</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="3.931">bank is still gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="159.329" dur="4.261">need to do because they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="3.93">anyone leaving their system and once you</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="5.97">leave their system you are then the</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="6.69">enemy of the central bankers that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="5.16">it normally works out I mean look at all</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="4.05">the countries that the central break and</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="2.609">I&amp;#39;m talking about the private western</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="3.98">central bankers where they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="177.329" dur="6.241">control those countries are the enemy</text>
  <text start="180.32" dur="5.46">now yes UK is still going to work with</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="4.11">the EU they&amp;#39;re still going to have</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="3.819">negotiations and things like that but</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all works out</text>
  <text start="189.599" dur="5.67">here in the United States what are we</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="7.4">saying well one in five US retail shops</text>
  <text start="195.269" dur="7.08">are still at risk of closing down Ryan</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="6.16">McCullough senior real estate economist</text>
  <text start="202.349" dur="4.621">with costar said the US has about 18</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="4.2">percent too much retail space when</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="5.129">compared with the historical average and</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="6.66">he&amp;#39;s saying that we need to return to a</text>
  <text start="212.099" dur="5.791">point in time where the retail industry</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.409">can be supported and to maintain this</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="5.25">and to do this we would have to</text>
  <text start="220.079" dur="5.611">basically close down 1.6 billion square</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="4.89">feet of selling Speight space while</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.6">maintaining current sales which is going</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="3.299">to be very difficult Cushman and</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.339">Wakefield is out there they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="6.331">that they&amp;#39;re forecasting 12,000 stores</text>
  <text start="234.629" dur="6.061">will close in the US this year up 33%</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="6.96">from the 9,000 that were closed down in</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="6.12">2017 so we see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="4.08">retail industry is not going to be doing</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="4.38">well and we know it&amp;#39;s not because of</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="4.31">online it&amp;#39;s because the people of</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="3.78">America they&amp;#39;re completely tapped out</text>
  <text start="253.01" dur="5.19">more and more people are using their</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="7.68">credit cards we see this we saw this on</text>
  <text start="258.2" dur="6.219">on the run-up to 2008 where the credit</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="3.6">card usage went really high people were</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="4.771">taking out home equity line of credit</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="5.52">and everything started to break down and</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="5.25">basically nobody had any funds after</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="6.119">that point in time we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="6.75">exact thing happened once again now we</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="5.311">know the US pension system well it is</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="6.96">really really bad</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="9.6">and it&amp;#39;s basically failing now what</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="8.31">Congress did was they quietly snuck in a</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="6.6">provision that forms a committee which</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="6.84">would use federal funds to bail out as</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="6.12">many as 200 multi-employer pension plans</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="4.61">where employers and labor unions jointly</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="5.97">provide retirement benefits to employees</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="6.73">now there we&amp;#39;re already pushing a</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="5.52">bailout because they know that the</text>
  <text start="314.64" dur="4.04">pension system is going to implode on</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="4.82">itself</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="5.7">and this is a taxpayer rescue plan once</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="5.85">again because the US pension system is</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="6.48">beyond repair and if you&amp;#39;re depending on</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="4.95">your pension it might not be there now</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="3.63">Boston College they estimate that</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="4.86">nation&amp;#39;s fourteen hundred multi-employer</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="5.97">plans are facing a five hundred and</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.92">fifty three billion shortfall and around</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="3.69">one quarter of those are in the redzone</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="5.28">meaning that they&amp;#39;ll go broke in the</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="6">next decade or so but congress committee</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="4.38">assuming it works wouldn&amp;#39;t even rescue</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="4.53">the redzone plants much less remaining</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="3.93">the remaining twelve hundred and it</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t even begin to address the real</text>
  <text start="356" dur="5.72">problem the seven trillion funding gap</text>
  <text start="358.91" dur="6.45">faced by the government&amp;#39;s own pensions</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="7.18">now congress is stepping in because the</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="5.7">pension guarantee corporation the PBGC</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="5.79">which is just like the Federal Deposit</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="6.09">Insurance Corporation it&amp;#39;s insolvent</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="6.06">they don&amp;#39;t have enough funds they have</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.65">the FDIC doesn&amp;#39;t have enough funds so</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="6.21">they can&amp;#39;t back up these pension plans</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="7.179">this is going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="9.09">disaster and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="7.771">is again this race this race to bring</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="5.58">down the system now we see that Trump is</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="5.82">putting in place tariffs with reciprocal</text>
  <text start="401.63" dur="8.219">taxes pushing forward his tax plans and</text>
  <text start="404.57" dur="7.439">trying to get the biggest spending type</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="4.021">of bill passed and I think the one that</text>
  <text start="412.009" dur="4.851">just passed the house still has the</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="6.99">sound of the go is the 1.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="5.83">omnibus spending package now many</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="4.14">reports ago and I probably said this so</text>
  <text start="422.69" dur="6.09">many times but remember how the central</text>
  <text start="425" dur="7.47">bankers work the central bankers never</text>
  <text start="428.78" dur="5.85">want a country to default they never</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="5.52">want to give them too much debt where</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="7.37">they say guess what we are bankrupt what</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="9.21">they do is they keep that fine line</text>
  <text start="442" dur="9.039">where they make government&amp;#39;s cut their</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="5.189">programs push austerity and make them</text>
  <text start="451.039" dur="4.261">take on more</text>
  <text start="452.389" dur="5.28">and they continually do this to the</text>
  <text start="455.3" dur="5.28">country over and over and over again and</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="7.05">they always make sure that they never</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="8.7">crash and burn what is happening right</text>
  <text start="464.719" dur="7.591">now is the opposite Trump with</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="5.939">everything that he&amp;#39;s doing is pushing</text>
  <text start="472.31" dur="6.72">this to the extreme how do you bring</text>
  <text start="475.219" dur="6.781">down a central banking system how do you</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="7.05">show the world that their system doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482" dur="7.5">work you take on as much debt as you</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="6.66">possibly can and you implode the system</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="5.52">now of course what you have to do is you</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="4.829">have to control the narrative you have</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="5.579">to show that this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="497.569" dur="5.671">problem now this omnibus the omnibus</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="5.1">bill that was passed by the house and</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="6.12">the I think the vote count was 256 to</text>
  <text start="505.699" dur="8.13">167 the Senate now has until midnight</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="6.059">Friday to pass it but within the Omnibus</text>
  <text start="513.829" dur="4.44">I mean it&amp;#39;s like two thousand two</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="5.67">hundred something pages they included</text>
  <text start="518.269" dur="5.221">the cloud Act which allows foreign</text>
  <text start="521.089" dur="4.921">governments to demand data from US</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="6.39">companies it was add to the Omni without</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="6.06">hearings markups or amendments now Rand</text>
  <text start="529.88" dur="3.93">Paul is out there saying that Congress</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="3.54">should reject the Cloud Act because it</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="4.05">fails to protect human rights or</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.68">America&amp;#39;s privacy gives up their</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="4.86">constitutional role and gives far too</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.35">much power to the Attorney General the</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="4.95">Secretary of State the president and</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="5.46">foreign governments and here we are once</text>
  <text start="547.67" dur="6.39">again where they&amp;#39;re taking a bill and</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="7.349">they&amp;#39;re sneaking other things into it we</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="6.139">see right now Trump is pushing a suit</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="5.431">against the World Trade Organization for</text>
  <text start="560.199" dur="5.171">against China for the trade law</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="5.55">violations this is another attempt to</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="7.56">push the entire system to the edge and</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="6.92">China well they&amp;#39;re looking maybe to</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="5.839">retaliate or maybe do nothing at all now</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="7.42">think about this for a second we know</text>
  <text start="578.769" dur="6.82">the deal between China the US Russia is</text>
  <text start="582.77" dur="6.059">to bring down the central banking system</text>
  <text start="585.589" dur="5.581">once again how do you do this well you</text>
  <text start="588.829" dur="5.791">push the system as hard as you possibly</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.209">can and you take on as much debt as</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="7.74">possible</text>
  <text start="596.379" dur="8.471">you start trade wars this way the cash</text>
  <text start="602.36" dur="6.539">reserves around the world they start to</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="7.409">dry up you enter a liquidity crisis the</text>
  <text start="608.899" dur="6.48">problems in the Middle East if they can</text>
  <text start="612.259" dur="5.341">push their agenda forward they can have</text>
  <text start="615.379" dur="4.65">the leaders of those countries take back</text>
  <text start="617.6" dur="4.649">control and most of them would move away</text>
  <text start="620.029" dur="5.191">from the dollar again they would stop</text>
  <text start="622.249" dur="5.221">adding the dollar to the reserves those</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="7.739">dollars would come back to the US be a</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="7.559">lot less dollars out there China because</text>
  <text start="632.959" dur="5.581">of these tariffs what can they do to</text>
  <text start="635.029" dur="6.3">retaliate against the US which they most</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="5.279">likely will but what can they do</text>
  <text start="641.329" dur="5.88">well one yeah they can have higher</text>
  <text start="643.819" dur="5.971">tariffs on the US exports to China they</text>
  <text start="647.209" dur="7.44">could do that because we export seeds</text>
  <text start="649.79" dur="7.769">fruits aircraft pulp metal wood ores</text>
  <text start="654.649" dur="6.781">things like that but what else can they</text>
  <text start="657.559" dur="6.661">really do well they can sell US</text>
  <text start="661.43" dur="5.159">Treasuries and they can buy other</text>
  <text start="664.22" dur="6.299">government bonds from other governments</text>
  <text start="666.589" dur="6.87">or they can purchase gold now think</text>
  <text start="670.519" dur="7.141">about this for a second what all of this</text>
  <text start="673.459" dur="7.761">has started they this whole entire</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="9.409">system is being pushed to the edge and</text>
  <text start="681.22" dur="8.89">allowing these countries to dump</text>
  <text start="687.069" dur="6.76">Treasuries now China has a lot of</text>
  <text start="690.11" dur="5.159">Treasuries before this if China just</text>
  <text start="693.829" dur="4.2">went ahead and started to dump</text>
  <text start="695.269" dur="5.25">Treasuries why would they do this what</text>
  <text start="698.029" dur="3.11">would be their excuse why would the</text>
  <text start="700.519" dur="3.24">world</text>
  <text start="701.139" dur="5.591">okaythis why would they look at this and</text>
  <text start="703.759" dur="4.89">say why you know now since Trump said</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="3.599">okay we&amp;#39;re placing tariffs China could</text>
  <text start="708.649" dur="2.761">say well we&amp;#39;re not going to be buying</text>
  <text start="710.329" dur="3.901">any more Treasuries</text>
  <text start="711.41" dur="6.359">we&amp;#39;ll start to dump them other countries</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="4.68">can say hey you know what if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.769" dur="3.571">dumping their Treasuries</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="5.61">and these tariffs all are also affect us</text>
  <text start="721.34" dur="6.44">we will dump our Treasuries and you can</text>
  <text start="724.52" dur="7.26">see how this whole thing will begin</text>
  <text start="727.78" dur="5.29">where everyone is starting to dump yes</text>
  <text start="731.78" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;ll be certain countries that hold</text>
  <text start="733.07" dur="5.04">on to them but you can see how all of</text>
  <text start="735.89" dur="3.96">this is coming about now</text>
  <text start="738.11" dur="3.99">the central bankers on the other hand</text>
  <text start="739.85" dur="3.98">they&amp;#39;re looking at this saying okay we</text>
  <text start="742.1" dur="4.74">see what he&amp;#39;s doing here</text>
  <text start="743.83" dur="5.53">we understand that he is pushing the</text>
  <text start="746.84" dur="5.58">economy to the edge and if he gets his</text>
  <text start="749.36" dur="6.12">way and controls the narrative guess</text>
  <text start="752.42" dur="5.52">what he&amp;#39;s coming after us</text>
  <text start="755.48" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s the whole plan now the central</text>
  <text start="757.94" dur="5.07">bankers they are going to push their</text>
  <text start="760.97" dur="6.48">agenda to try to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="763.01" dur="5.88">and control the narrative now in the</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="3.21">middle of all this is the people the</text>
  <text start="768.89" dur="3.96">people of United States the people of</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="3.24">the world a lot of these people are</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="2.85">going to have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="773.9" dur="4.41">during this transition will be a lot</text>
  <text start="775.7" dur="3.78">easier without the central bank but the</text>
  <text start="778.31" dur="3.15">central bank doesn&amp;#39;t care about people</text>
  <text start="779.48" dur="3.24">they don&amp;#39;t care about a government they</text>
  <text start="781.46" dur="4.25">don&amp;#39;t care about anything except their</text>
  <text start="782.72" dur="6.24">privates it&amp;#39;s a private corporation and</text>
  <text start="785.71" dur="6.22">they want to make you know money out of</text>
  <text start="788.96" dur="5.43">this deal and they want to gain hard</text>
  <text start="791.93" dur="4.77">assets that&amp;#39;s what they normally do they</text>
  <text start="794.39" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t I mean listen they print paper and</text>
  <text start="796.7" dur="4.2">ink they don&amp;#39;t want the paper in ink</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="3.99">because they know it&amp;#39;s worth nothing</text>
  <text start="800.9" dur="4.05">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="802.79" dur="4.86">trade that paper in incan for for hard</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="4.29">assets they want to have government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.65" dur="2.13">sell off their property for pennies on</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="3.54">the dollar</text>
  <text start="809.78" dur="5.52">they want their creditors you know the</text>
  <text start="812.78" dur="4.83">individuals that are part of the central</text>
  <text start="815.3" dur="4.98">bank part of the painting systems to go</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="6.5">in and purchase those hard assets that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.28" dur="6.66">what they really want so this is a race</text>
  <text start="824.11" dur="4.33">to see who will control this and you can</text>
  <text start="826.94" dur="4.5">see this is really heating up right now</text>
  <text start="828.44" dur="5.34">and in the next couple of weeks once</text>
  <text start="831.44" dur="4.5">everything is put into place we will see</text>
  <text start="833.78" dur="3">what China does if they make they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="835.94" dur="2.58">going to come out and say hey we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="836.78" dur="3.57">dumping all the Treasuries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="838.52" dur="4.29">probably going to say okay guess what</text>
  <text start="840.35" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;ll make the next move we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="842.81" dur="6.63">higher tariffs on selected US exports to</text>
  <text start="846.32" dur="5.34">China and then Trump most likely will do</text>
  <text start="849.44" dur="3.12">something else and then China will say</text>
  <text start="851.66" dur="3.27">okay we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="4.38">being you know maybe three billion worth</text>
  <text start="854.93" dur="3.48">of Treasuries then Trump will do</text>
  <text start="856.94" dur="4.19">something else and this will probably go</text>
  <text start="858.41" dur="7.14">back and forth and before you know it</text>
  <text start="861.13" dur="7.48">cash again is in demand but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="865.55" dur="4.5">cash out there Europe has no cash we</text>
  <text start="868.61" dur="4.41">enter start we start to enter a</text>
  <text start="870.05" dur="5.82">liquidity crisis and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="5.19">starts to move forward now the banks are</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="4.86">gonna run into problems most of these</text>
  <text start="878.21" dur="4.23">banks I would say 99.99% of these banks</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="6.03">are completely in solving these stress</text>
  <text start="882.44" dur="6.839">tests are a complete and utter joke this</text>
  <text start="886.76" dur="5.31">is when they&amp;#39;ll push the bank holiday</text>
  <text start="889.279" dur="6.121">this is when the central bankers and</text>
  <text start="892.07" dur="6.87">most likely the deep state wherever else</text>
  <text start="895.4" dur="5.189">they might push an event to cover all of</text>
  <text start="898.94" dur="3.089">this up this is something that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="900.589" dur="3.271">gonna have to and the Patriots are gonna</text>
  <text start="902.029" dur="4.56">have to work against to make sure that</text>
  <text start="903.86" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t do now if they have control</text>
  <text start="906.589" dur="4.561">of the malware the algorithms and they</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="4.98">know where everything is they can stop</text>
  <text start="911.15" dur="4.26">this but they&amp;#39;re going to try the</text>
  <text start="913.7" dur="3.45">bail-ins they&amp;#39;re gonna try the bailouts</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="917.15" dur="6.12">can to save their system and what I mean</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="6">by save it I don&amp;#39;t mean save the current</text>
  <text start="923.27" dur="6.54">system but save what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="927.05" dur="4.32">all about controlling governments</text>
  <text start="929.81" dur="4.95">because they want to move their system</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="5.61">someplace else so they want to save</text>
  <text start="934.76" dur="4.44">their integrity they want to show people</text>
  <text start="936.98" dur="3.48">that they&amp;#39;re still controlling</text>
  <text start="939.2" dur="4.17">everything they want to show people that</text>
  <text start="940.46" dur="5.01">they can still manage an economy that</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="4.8">you can still trust the central bank and</text>
  <text start="945.47" dur="4.53">Trump and the Patriots on the other side</text>
  <text start="948.17" dur="4.2">are going to try to strip this all the</text>
  <text start="950" dur="4.86">way from them to show that you can&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="952.37" dur="5.46">I believe this is why in the end there</text>
  <text start="954.86" dur="5.28">will be the audit the Fed bill it will</text>
  <text start="957.83" dur="4.5">pass I mean a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="3.42">believe that there was going to be peace</text>
  <text start="962.33" dur="2.91">talks in North Korea</text>
  <text start="963.56" dur="5.7">I mean everyone was speaking about the</text>
  <text start="965.24" dur="7.23">opposite here we were talking about how</text>
  <text start="969.26" dur="5.37">peace was being negotiated behind the</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="4.29">scenes and then all of a sudden it just</text>
  <text start="974.63" dur="4.77">came out that there was peace the same</text>
  <text start="976.76" dur="4.71">thing is happening right now all this</text>
  <text start="979.4" dur="3.689">stuff behind the scenes the corporate</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="3.93">media and everyone else they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="983.089" dur="3.221">going to discuss this but we can see</text>
  <text start="985.4" dur="3.19">what&amp;#39;s happening we can</text>
  <text start="986.31" dur="3.35">all the indicators now again this is a</text>
  <text start="988.59" dur="4.02">plan</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="4.63">nothing is carved into stone and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.61" dur="5.72">always things that can go wrong but this</text>
  <text start="994.29" dur="6.33">is the plan where everything is headed</text>
  <text start="998.33" dur="4.06">so no matter what we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="1000.62" dur="7.29">through a reset and when I say reset</text>
  <text start="1002.39" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s a reset of the economy to get away</text>
  <text start="1007.91" dur="6.3">from the central bank economy it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="6.96">reset of resetting government officials</text>
  <text start="1014.21" dur="8.79">it&amp;#39;s a reset of the way the u.s. does</text>
  <text start="1017.39" dur="9.299">business it&amp;#39;s a reset of how we run the</text>
  <text start="1023" dur="6">country under a new system that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1026.689" dur="5.071">this is all about this is what this is</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="6.06">all being done to do this is where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1031.76" dur="5.25">all being pushed to do and we can see</text>
  <text start="1035.06" dur="3">that we&amp;#39;re getting very very close</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="3.059">because things are starting to really</text>
  <text start="1038.06" dur="4.29">heat up and I think when we get into the</text>
  <text start="1040.069" dur="4.291">second part of this year we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1042.35" dur="5.13">things that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and</text>
  <text start="1044.36" dur="5.94">you&amp;#39;re going to hear and see things that</text>
  <text start="1047.48" dur="4.38">you thought would never happen because</text>
  <text start="1050.3" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about it for so long</text>
  <text start="1051.86" dur="5.069">and I think we&amp;#39;re getting very very</text>
  <text start="1054.08" dur="5.58">close because you can see each side</text>
  <text start="1056.929" dur="5.401">taking their position each side getting</text>
  <text start="1059.66" dur="4.97">ready to pounce on the other each side</text>
  <text start="1062.33" dur="6.63">getting ready to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="1064.63" dur="6.46">so get prepared get ready because we&amp;#39;re</text>
