  <text start="27.38" dur="5.23">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="30.359" dur="5.401">name is dave and this is episode 395 in</text>
  <text start="32.61" dur="4.71">today&amp;#39;s date is jun 19 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="3.509">title this episode is the central</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="4.32">bankers US government strategic plan for</text>
  <text start="39.269" dur="4.11">the Middle East now they do have a plan</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="3.75">it might not be going as well as they</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="3.451">wanted but we&amp;#39;re going to discuss this a</text>
  <text start="45.39" dur="3.39">little bit later in this report I put a</text>
  <text start="46.83" dur="3.18">whole section together and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="3.18">to go through the timeline and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="50.01" dur="4.56">going on in Iraq and what we can expect</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="4.44">and what false flags are headed our way</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="3.239">but let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="56.4" dur="3.63">news we&amp;#39;ll get through that first and</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="4.591">then we&amp;#39;ll get into that section and we</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="4.919">see that the initial jobless claims they</text>
  <text start="62.4" dur="6.42">have been posted and these claims are at</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="5.401">the new seven-year lows and of course</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="3.719">the government has the ability to</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.92">manipulate job numbers they have the</text>
  <text start="72.539" dur="5.131">ability to manipulate GDP inflation and</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="3.93">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that every single</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="3">thing that has to do with the government</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="2.849">where they can manipulate it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="4.019">showing us where in a recovery</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="7.11">everything outside of their control like</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="8.07">real estate sales if you look at retail</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="5.761">sales retail stores closing sales in</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.231">companies it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="5.159">manipulate that type of information of</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="4.89">course they most likely can try but the</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="3.871">news kind of gets out there and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="3.989">very difficult to do and it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="4.049">keep that illusion alive and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="4.5">seeing right now is of course real</text>
  <text start="107.999" dur="4.11">estate is imploding we see retail is</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.591">falling apart more and more stores are</text>
  <text start="112.109" dur="4.68">closing sales and stores are not doing</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="4.409">well and we&amp;#39;re also seeing that</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="4.62">caterpillar their Asian sales have</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="5.04">cratered by thirty percent and their</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="6.261">worldwide sales have crater to twelve</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="6.481">percent this is eighteen months of</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="5.95">declining annual sales this is not a</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.489">good sign of how the economy is doing we</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="5.22">also see the Baltic Dry Index again down</text>
  <text start="136.379" dur="4.541">we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen this is another</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="6.22">indicator the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="6.179">and of course the Fed is out there the</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="4.46">US government&amp;#39;s out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.099" dur="5.011">saying that we are under recovery</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="4.84">everything seems to be doing well it</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="4.41">might have slowed slowed a little bit</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="5.7">but don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re in this fantastic</text>
  <text start="156.52" dur="7.11">recovery and the other day I reported on</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="6.24">the Fed they&amp;#39;re introducing an exit type</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="5.04">of fee on bonds and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="166.3" dur="6.45">interesting about this is that they want</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="6.3">to prevent a bond run during the</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="4.2">collapse situation and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="4.62">put the exit fee on there but if you</text>
  <text start="176.95" dur="5.22">really think about this by putting the</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="5.729">exit fee on the bonds right now when you</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="6.3">sell them wouldn&amp;#39;t more people try to</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="5.7">get out of bonds before the exit fee is</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="5.31">there and take that money and put it</text>
  <text start="191.019" dur="8.121">into the stock market I mean they might</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="7.89">be starting a bond run right now to</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="5.11">convince everyone of course when they</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.5">create this event of another country or</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="4.38">group hitting the United States with a</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="6.42">false flag event blaming them for the</text>
  <text start="208.63" dur="7.31">collapse but this could be their initial</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="5.67">set off of the collapse of the economy</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="3.97">taking the money out of the bond market</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="3.06">people moving they need to put it</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="3.48">someplace they put it into the stock</text>
  <text start="221.32" dur="3.84">market pumping that up and of course</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s going to completely pop and</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="5.639">collapse in itself we already know that</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="6.599">real estate retail jobs they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="5.761">suffering everything&amp;#39;s declining and we</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="5.671">can see already the Fed and many other</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="5.04">financial institutions are telling us</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="4.56">that the GDP numbers are being</text>
  <text start="241.6" dur="3.719">downgraded they&amp;#39;re not seeing the growth</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="3.54">that they thought they were going to see</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="3.631">we&amp;#39;re not seeing that take off that they</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="3.12">thought which I never believed we were</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="2.789">going to see one actually I always</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="2.82">thought it was going to be worse than</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="3.601">the first quarter and of course as we</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="4.05">know the GDP numbers had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="3.78">with the weather we all know that we</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="3.69">know that this economy is completely</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="4.049">failing we know this debt around the</text>
  <text start="261.19" dur="4.5">world cannot be sustained Europe&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="263.169" dur="5.041">turmoil the United States is right there</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="4.14">but of course with all the court with</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="4.05">all the government numbers they can</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="3.81">manipulate them and create the illusion</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="2.44">we&amp;#39;re in this recovery and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="2.73">interesting we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="5.07">placing all these sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.72">not really rush itself individuals and</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="3.33">certain companies and the corporate</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.17">media&amp;#39;s out there letting us know that</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="4.65">you know Russia suffering they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="4.2">terrible United States is doing very</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="5.73">very well but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="6.84">now is the Russia&amp;#39;s GDP they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="293.48" dur="4.65">revise their GDP up because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="4.47">seeing more investment they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="4.8">more growth here in the United States</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.83">were seeing the opposite where they were</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="4.95">telling us gdp was three percent and now</text>
  <text start="305.6" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re loaning it down to 2.8 now to</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="4.44">2.1 and our GDP in their previous</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="3.45">quarter was in the negative range of</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="3.42">course they told it was a positive point</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="3.9">five percent and then they revised it</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="5.19">once to negative 1.1 they revised it</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="5.16">again- 1.6 so we can see where the</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="3.99">United States economy is going and we</text>
  <text start="322.97" dur="3.78">see where the Russian economy is going</text>
  <text start="324.92" dur="4.14">and of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="4.62">government always seems to tell us the</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="4.5">opposite of what is really happening and</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="5.52">that goes pretty much with everything</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="5.49">the economy the war the wars that are</text>
  <text start="336.89" dur="4.08">going on around the world and why we are</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="4.62">there it is completely always the</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="5.04">opposite and they will never tell us the</text>
  <text start="343.67" dur="3.93">real truth of what is going on and of</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="3.24">course they don&amp;#39;t want to tell us the</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="4.53">truth because they really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="5.91">that highly of the people of America I</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="5.82">think they&amp;#39;re above us they think of us</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="4.29">as just workers slaves to do what they</text>
  <text start="357.95" dur="3.12">want we shouldn&amp;#39;t question their</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="3.78">authority we couldn&amp;#39;t we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.07" dur="4.59">question the government we shouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="4.95">anything except do what they want and</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s all they care about and what</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="6.86">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that drones</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="7.23">now as we know are of course everywhere</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.81">right now they have cameras on them but</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing that drones are now being</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="5.55">fitted with pepper spray paint bowl</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="5.64">devices and eventually they&amp;#39;ll be armed</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="5.43">with real weaponry the skunk riot</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="4.71">control copter built by south african</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="5.01">company desert wolf has a suite of</text>
  <text start="393.29" dur="4.74">cameras and for paintball gun strapped</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="5.07">to its chassis to help its operators</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="4.86">monitor and control unruly crowds the</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="4.17">guns can fire ammunition from four</text>
  <text start="402.89" dur="4.02">different hoppers meaning the drone</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="3.03">operators can true protesters with dye</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="3.48">markers saw</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="5.1">plastic pellets and small capitals of</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="5.7">pepper spray and we will definitely see</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="5.61">these coming here to the US UK will see</text>
  <text start="416.09" dur="4.56">them and everyone else where they need</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="3.6">to control the situation they will</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="4.26">probably most likely see these drones</text>
  <text start="422.42" dur="5.25">being purchased and they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="5.49">this for when the time comes and we know</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="5.1">that when the time comes we will realize</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="4.5">it because we will see the value of the</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="4.25">dollar continually decrease we will see</text>
  <text start="434.9" dur="4.89">prices and the stores and everywhere</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="4.69">start to inch up and when I say start to</text>
  <text start="439.79" dur="3.57">inch up I don&amp;#39;t mean like by thirty</text>

  <text start="833.69" dur="5.91">now a couple of reports ago I reported</text>
  <text start="836.3" dur="5.7">on Uganda where they said they stopped</text>

  <text start="844.73" dur="2.91">still in the search of this Terrace</text>
  <text start="846.5" dur="2.97">group because they were planning on</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="5.43">something but it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="5.76">during the same time period Uganda plans</text>
  <text start="853.07" dur="6.06">to invite six Chinese companies next</text>

  <text start="866.3" dur="3.51">said this before but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="867.44" dur="5.31">interesting the timing is always the</text>
  <text start="869.81" dur="5.01">same time period when these African</text>
  <text start="872.75" dur="3.84">nations are making deals with China all</text>
  <text start="874.82" dur="5.1">of a sudden we have this terrorist</text>
  <text start="876.59" dur="5.25">attack during the al-shabaab but kenya</text>

  <text start="896.9" dur="5.16">the oil from the Sudan region and it</text>
  <text start="899.24" dur="5.28">seems like every single time China is</text>
  <text start="902.06" dur="4.8">there the central bankers are saying</text>
  <text start="904.52" dur="4.29">let&amp;#39;s start something and we need to get</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="3.63">into that area Uganda signed an</text>
  <text start="908.81" dur="3.14">agreement with Chinese government giving</text>
  <text start="910.49" dur="5.6">companies from the Asian nation</text>

  <text start="918.74" dur="5.43">and we are inviting only Chinese</text>
  <text start="921.68" dur="5.34">companies so we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="924.17" dur="4.86">playing out and we can see why there was</text>
  <text start="927.02" dur="3.99">this terrorist group funded by an</text>
  <text start="929.03" dur="7.7">outside source United States government</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="10.59">CIA to really wreak havoc in that area</text>

  <text start="1885.46" dur="3.87">Sunni soldiers in the Iraqi army quickly</text>
  <text start="1887.26" dur="6">abandoned their posts dropped their</text>
  <text start="1889.33" dur="9.71">weapons and join the other side and you</text>
  <text start="1893.26" dur="5.78">can see that all of this was pretty much</text>
  <text start="1899.64" dur="4.93">done without the u.s. really</text>
  <text start="1902.53" dur="4.23">understanding what was going on they</text>
  <text start="1904.57" dur="4.17">thought they were in control of Isis</text>
  <text start="1906.76" dur="3.6">they thought they paid them they thought</text>
  <text start="1908.74" dur="3.44">they armed them and they thought they</text>
  <text start="1910.36" dur="5.07">were going to use this core group to</text>
  <text start="1912.18" dur="6.55">completely disrupt what was going on in</text>
  <text start="1915.43" dur="4.98">Iraq and hopefully create terror there</text>
  <text start="1918.73" dur="2.97">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is more</text>
  <text start="1920.41" dur="4.35">government officials are out there</text>
  <text start="1921.7" dur="4.59">calling this a civil war a sectarian war</text>
  <text start="1924.76" dur="4.92">and it&amp;#39;s getting further and further</text>
  <text start="1926.29" dur="6.36">into that and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1929.68" dur="5.16">when the soldiers you know drop their</text>
  <text start="1932.65" dur="4.98">weapons they said they were called from</text>
  <text start="1934.84" dur="4.44">higher ranking officers to say now just</text>
  <text start="1937.63" dur="3.9">drop your weapons and leave and I think</text>
  <text start="1939.28" dur="4.71">this was part of the u.s. plan to make</text>
  <text start="1941.53" dur="4.56">it look like this Isis group was just</text>
  <text start="1943.99" dur="4.8">taking over and they didn&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="1946.09" dur="4.89">resistance from the Iraqi army but what</text>
  <text start="1948.79" dur="4.53">happened was yes some of them ran off</text>
  <text start="1950.98" dur="4.89">but others completely joined up and</text>
  <text start="1953.32" dur="4.29">really swept through the region because</text>
  <text start="1955.87" dur="3.72">they have the support of the bath group</text>
  <text start="1957.61" dur="5.34">they have support of the Sunnis and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1959.59" dur="5.13">taken on a life of its own right now and</text>
  <text start="1962.95" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s not what they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="1964.72" dur="5.58">happen now Maliki of course saying that</text>
  <text start="1968.68" dur="3.63">he&amp;#39;s not going to step down and the US</text>
  <text start="1970.3" dur="4.44">government wants him to step down and</text>
  <text start="1972.31" dur="5.37">because things are getting out of</text>
  <text start="1974.74" dur="5.73">control there other regions are selling</text>
  <text start="1977.68" dur="5.1">the oil not through Baghdad anymore</text>
  <text start="1980.47" dur="5.1">Malik is confusing control of the</text>
  <text start="1982.78" dur="5.1">country and the united states had some</text>
  <text start="1985.57" dur="6.06">other plan they wanted to use these</text>
  <text start="1987.88" dur="7.26">terrorists to pretty much provoke a war</text>
  <text start="1991.63" dur="5.34">into syria because they wanted to create</text>
  <text start="1995.14" dur="3.69">an instance where the united states</text>
  <text start="1996.97" dur="4.14">could come into the situation now they</text>
  <text start="1998.83" dur="4.11">are still using this to their advantage</text>
  <text start="2001.11" dur="4.62">and they&amp;#39;re still pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="2002.94" dur="5.01">at this time so Maliki is not going to</text>
  <text start="2005.73" dur="4.08">step down he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be removed</text>
  <text start="2007.95" dur="3.33">from power but of course the United</text>
  <text start="2009.81" dur="2.83">States of course that supported them all</text>
  <text start="2011.28" dur="4.45">the way up into this point</text>
  <text start="2012.64" dur="6.09">said now you need to step down Iraq</text>
  <text start="2015.73" dur="5.82">veterans are saying do not enter a rack</text>
  <text start="2018.73" dur="4.92">at this time it&amp;#39;s not going to help we</text>
  <text start="2021.55" dur="6.3">were there and we should not intervene</text>
  <text start="2023.65" dur="8.88">in Iraq whatsoever now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="2027.85" dur="7.41">Sunni insurgents group has taken control</text>
  <text start="2032.53" dur="5.4">of the oil refinery embody they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2035.26" dur="5.55">raised the ISIS militant black flag</text>
  <text start="2037.93" dur="6.72">there they have captured it and now they</text>
  <text start="2040.81" dur="5.46">are going after the oil fields and of</text>
  <text start="2044.65" dur="3.72">course they need to take control of all</text>
  <text start="2046.27" dur="4.17">this they&amp;#39;re heading towards Baghdad and</text>
  <text start="2048.37" dur="4.74">we can see that this is growing bigger</text>
  <text start="2050.44" dur="5.489">and bigger more Sunnis or joining this</text>
  <text start="2053.11" dur="6.09">entire group that is making leaps and</text>
  <text start="2055.929" dur="4.921">bounds across and of course the United</text>
  <text start="2059.2" dur="3.57">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="2060.85" dur="3.51">looking at this and saying listen we can</text>
  <text start="2062.77" dur="3.81">use this to our advantage this is not</text>
  <text start="2064.36" dur="4.65">how it was planned but we can use this</text>
  <text start="2066.58" dur="4.589">we see that out we ask al Maliki to step</text>
  <text start="2069.01" dur="4.62">down but this he will be removed</text>
  <text start="2071.169" dur="5.041">eventually we can use this to bring in</text>
  <text start="2073.63" dur="3.96">and start a war and eventually get into</text>
  <text start="2076.21" dur="3.18">Syria and it looks like this is what</text>
  <text start="2077.59" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re trying to do now President Obama</text>
  <text start="2079.39" dur="5.73">is saying he can do whatever he wants he</text>
  <text start="2081.94" dur="7.08">doesn&amp;#39;t need permission from Congress to</text>
  <text start="2085.12" dur="6.51">go into Iraq but yeah he does article 2</text>
  <text start="2089.02" dur="4.53">section 2 of the Constitution gives the</text>
  <text start="2091.63" dur="3.75">executive branch the command of the</text>
  <text start="2093.55" dur="3.93">nation&amp;#39;s armed forces while article 1</text>
  <text start="2095.38" dur="3.96">section 8 gives the legislative branch</text>
  <text start="2097.48" dur="3.72">the power to decide when the United</text>
  <text start="2099.34" dur="4.92">States goes to war and you have to</text>
  <text start="2101.2" dur="5.28">remember the only reason that the United</text>
  <text start="2104.26" dur="4.35">States can use drones in Yemen because</text>
  <text start="2106.48" dur="3.51">the Congress allows that if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2108.61" dur="3.81">al-qaeda and this is why they call</text>
  <text start="2109.99" dur="4.83">everyone al Qaeda the Congress said if</text>
  <text start="2112.42" dur="3.99">they are al Qaeda we can use and push</text>
  <text start="2114.82" dur="4.65">them back and you can use drones you</text>
  <text start="2116.41" dur="5.1">have to remember in Iraq right now Isis</text>
  <text start="2119.47" dur="3.78">is not al-qaeda they said it was a</text>
  <text start="2121.51" dur="4.89">splinter group and of course the United</text>
  <text start="2123.25" dur="5.58">States train them they paid them they</text>
  <text start="2126.4" dur="4.35">gave them weapons and they said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2128.83" dur="3.75">not part of al Qaeda it&amp;#39;s a separate</text>
  <text start="2130.75" dur="3.87">group so they cannot use drones and just</text>
  <text start="2132.58" dur="3.87">go in and attack them because it is not</text>
  <text start="2134.62" dur="3.48">al Qaeda and this is the problem they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2136.45" dur="4.17">having they kind of screwed themselves</text>
  <text start="2138.1" dur="5.34">with this and what we don&amp;#39;t know is that</text>
  <text start="2140.62" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s about six thousand security</text>
  <text start="2143.44" dur="5.52">backup forces US forces already</text>
  <text start="2146.56" dur="4.71">Iraq the United States is keeping more</text>
  <text start="2148.96" dur="4.95">than 6,000 security and backup forces in</text>
  <text start="2151.27" dur="4.56">Iraq sources say these forces are former</text>
  <text start="2153.91" dur="3.48">military members who have remained in</text>
  <text start="2155.83" dur="4.2">the country after changing their</text>
  <text start="2157.39" dur="6.36">official job title so they kept people</text>
  <text start="2160.03" dur="5.4">there now what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is Obama</text>
  <text start="2163.75" dur="3.51">who said there were no boots on the</text>
  <text start="2165.43" dur="4.98">ground he&amp;#39;s setting in Special Forces</text>
  <text start="2167.26" dur="5.25">military advisors it&amp;#39;s not really boots</text>
  <text start="2170.41" dur="4.95">on the ground because their advisors but</text>
  <text start="2172.51" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re ready for combat and we can see</text>
  <text start="2175.36" dur="4.74">that they&amp;#39;re going in there to try to</text>
  <text start="2177.16" dur="5.88">figure out what is going on to bring</text>
  <text start="2180.1" dur="5.01">back intelligence and this is not going</text>
  <text start="2183.04" dur="4.56">to go down well of course what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2185.11" dur="5.85">to happen is they need to get us into</text>
  <text start="2187.6" dur="5.01">Iraq somehow someway and David Petraeus</text>
  <text start="2190.96" dur="4.29">is out there saying he&amp;#39;s warning Obama</text>
  <text start="2192.61" dur="5.88">that this is a grace a great risk</text>
  <text start="2195.25" dur="5.22">militarily with Iraq the Army General</text>
  <text start="2198.49" dur="5.73">who oversaw the US military surge of</text>
  <text start="2200.47" dur="5.97">troops into Iraq in 2007 issued a stark</text>
  <text start="2204.22" dur="4.98">warning Wednesday on any further</text>
  <text start="2206.44" dur="4.86">military action the bottom line he warns</text>
  <text start="2209.2" dur="4.32">this this cannot be the United States</text>
  <text start="2211.3" dur="6.09">being the Air Force for Shiite militias</text>
  <text start="2213.52" dur="6.06">or Shiite on Sunni because we are not</text>
  <text start="2217.39" dur="4.62">getting involved in a sectarian war or a</text>
  <text start="2219.58" dur="4.29">civil war so we can see they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="2222.01" dur="3.09">to realize that these are no longer</text>
  <text start="2223.87" dur="3">terrorists and I look around the</text>
  <text start="2225.1" dur="4.23">corporate media what do I say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2226.87" dur="6.65">really not saying terrorism anymore they</text>
  <text start="2229.33" dur="8.28">using the word Sunni very interesting</text>
  <text start="2233.52" dur="7.09">now the United States is behind this</text>
  <text start="2237.61" dur="6">entire operation it got out of control</text>
  <text start="2240.61" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re having a sectarian Civil War</text>
  <text start="2243.61" dur="3.72">right now in Iraq but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2246.16" dur="6.35">use this through it to their advantage</text>
  <text start="2247.33" dur="9.12">and their plan was to get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="2252.51" dur="6.85">remove the borders in Syria and Iraq and</text>
  <text start="2256.45" dur="5.7">divide and divide them into Sunni Shiite</text>
  <text start="2259.36" dur="6">and Kurds this way they can maintain</text>
  <text start="2262.15" dur="6.57">control each portion would have their</text>
  <text start="2265.36" dur="5.7">own area and they can continue with the</text>
  <text start="2268.72" dur="5.43">oil flow on the US dollar but the</text>
  <text start="2271.06" dur="5.43">problem is Syria is the problem and</text>
  <text start="2274.15" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve always had this problem and this</text>
  <text start="2276.49" dur="3.32">is why they&amp;#39;ve been fighting in Syria</text>
  <text start="2278.35" dur="3.89">all along now this is a very</text>
  <text start="2279.81" dur="5.28">difficult task to do with this plan to</text>
  <text start="2282.24" dur="3.81">try to divide up the area and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2285.09" dur="2.91">think they&amp;#39;re going to be able to do it</text>
  <text start="2286.05" dur="4.77">because Assad in that country right now</text>
  <text start="2288" dur="4.71">is way too strong he&amp;#39;s been pushing out</text>
  <text start="2290.82" dur="5.46">the rebels that&amp;#39;s pretty much over so</text>
  <text start="2292.71" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re using this entire problem right</text>
  <text start="2296.28" dur="3.78">now to their advantage because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2298.26" dur="4.23">definitely going to go into Syria and</text>
  <text start="2300.06" dur="7.5">the only thing that is holding them back</text>
  <text start="2302.49" dur="7.29">is how to get in there they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2307.56" dur="4.89">al-qaeda they&amp;#39;re now saying it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2309.78" dur="5.82">sectarian Sunni civil war with the</text>
  <text start="2312.45" dur="5.28">Shiites so this poses a problem most of</text>
  <text start="2315.6" dur="4.41">the Americans are saying we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2317.73" dur="4.2">to go to war Congress is leaning toward</text>
  <text start="2320.01" dur="4.8">no we should not get involved with this</text>
  <text start="2321.93" dur="5.58">right now so there is a huge huge</text>
  <text start="2324.81" dur="4.59">problem Secretary of State John Kerry</text>
  <text start="2327.51" dur="3.12">said the insurgents in Iraq of course</text>
  <text start="2329.4" dur="3.06">he&amp;#39;s called an insurgents what happened</text>
  <text start="2330.63" dur="3.87">to the word terrorists that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2332.46" dur="4.65">interesting or more extreme than the</text>
  <text start="2334.5" dur="4.26">than al Qaeda and our threat to the</text>
  <text start="2337.11" dur="3.9">interest of the US now they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="2338.76" dur="4.17">bringing that back saying this group is</text>
  <text start="2341.01" dur="3.84">a threat to the interest of the USDA</text>
  <text start="2342.93" dur="3.9">have to remember this group now is made</text>
  <text start="2344.85" dur="4.32">up of the people in these cities who are</text>
  <text start="2346.83" dur="5.25">Sunni these people who were part of the</text>
  <text start="2349.17" dur="4.62">Iraq forces and they&amp;#39;re really not a</text>
  <text start="2352.08" dur="4.89">threat to the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2353.79" dur="4.92">using this for this event that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2356.97" dur="4.08">building up and they are trying to build</text>
  <text start="2358.71" dur="4.5">this up quite a bit same thing in UK</text>
  <text start="2361.05" dur="3.72">European nations they are building this</text>
  <text start="2363.21" dur="4.11">up all over the place saying that is</text>
  <text start="2364.77" dur="4.86">going to be another 911 and right now</text>
  <text start="2367.32" dur="6.78">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these</text>
  <text start="2369.63" dur="6.27">insurgents these terrorists of course</text>
  <text start="2374.1" dur="4.14">this is saying this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="2375.9" dur="4.02">wall street journal Sunni extremists</text>
  <text start="2378.24" dur="5.34">they keep it&amp;#39;s amazing how they went</text>
  <text start="2379.92" dur="5.82">from terrorists to insurgents to Sunni</text>
  <text start="2383.58" dur="3.72">extremists and they can keep changing</text>
  <text start="2385.74" dur="4.02">the title because it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="2387.3" dur="5.34">prove because these stories coming out</text>
  <text start="2389.76" dur="4.29">of Iraq kind of conflict with what the</text>

  <text start="2451.27" dur="6.45">here in the US so you can see how they</text>
  <text start="2454.72" dur="6.6">are pushing this agenda they definitely</text>
  <text start="2457.72" dur="4.47">want to bring some time of an event here</text>
  <text start="2461.32" dur="2.37">in the United States now I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2462.19" dur="3.99">saying this for quite a while they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2463.69" dur="4.98">been saying that Syria was the launch</text>
  <text start="2466.18" dur="3.99">pad for terrorists and here we have Isis</text>
  <text start="2468.67" dur="4.71">and ISIL but we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="2470.17" dur="5.1">United States train them they are also</text>
  <text start="2473.38" dur="4.23">going to use them of course the core</text>
  <text start="2475.27" dur="4.47">group that they can control which are</text>
  <text start="2477.61" dur="4.59">mostly Americans apartment part of CIA</text>
  <text start="2479.74" dur="4.29">and other organizations they have</text>
  <text start="2482.2" dur="3.12">passports to come back into the United</text>
  <text start="2484.03" dur="3">States and of course as we know they are</text>
  <text start="2485.32" dur="3.6">in lone wolf groups all around the</text>
  <text start="2487.03" dur="3.96">United States they have been planning</text>
  <text start="2488.92" dur="4.17">and already prepping what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2490.99" dur="4.2">to do here in the United States and we</text>
  <text start="2493.09" dur="4.62">will most likely see some type of power</text>
  <text start="2495.19" dur="4.98">grid hit that will bring the system down</text>
  <text start="2497.71" dur="3.9">maybe some type of dirty new chemical</text>
  <text start="2500.17" dur="3.03">weapon go off all around the country</text>
  <text start="2501.61" dur="4.59">because this is going to have to be a</text>
  <text start="2503.2" dur="5.43">lot bigger than 911 to get us back into</text>
  <text start="2506.2" dur="5.01">Iraq then into Syria and of course this</text>
  <text start="2508.63" dur="4.62">poses a huge huge problem because who is</text>
  <text start="2511.21" dur="3.66">waiting on the other side China and</text>
  <text start="2513.25" dur="4.65">Russia and this will definitely bring us</text>

  <text start="2526.57" dur="4.08">financial institutions some of the power</text>
  <text start="2528.52" dur="3.75">grid they will use physical attacks on</text>
  <text start="2530.65" dur="3.57">the power grid and a lot of cities are</text>
  <text start="2532.27" dur="3.51">going to lose power we&amp;#39;re also going to</text>

  <text start="2563.93" dur="6.27">times worse than 911 because let me say</text>
  <text start="2567.32" dur="4.86">this is the only way pretty much that</text>
  <text start="2570.2" dur="3.51">they can bring us back into Iraq unless</text>
