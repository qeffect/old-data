  <text start="37.45" dur="5.31">seventeenth 2016 and title the episode</text>
  <text start="40.54" dur="4.98">is the current economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="42.76" dur="5.549">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="45.52" dur="5.67">collapse news now at this point everyone</text>
  <text start="48.309" dur="4.471">is starting to realize that the Fed it</text>
  <text start="51.19" dur="3.36">does not work for the people it works</text>
  <text start="52.78" dur="3.81">from the selves it works for profit it</text>
  <text start="54.55" dur="5.189">works for debt it works for control of</text>
  <text start="56.59" dur="5.819">the people and it seems like the Federal</text>
  <text start="59.739" dur="6.451">Reserve in Dallas may be involved in</text>
  <text start="62.409" dur="6.151">some unethical activities in regards to</text>
  <text start="66.19" dur="5.04">banks now this shouldn&amp;#39;t come as a</text>
  <text start="68.56" dur="4.32">surprise to anyone that the Fed works</text>
  <text start="71.23" dur="4.89">with the banking system the banking</text>
  <text start="72.88" dur="5.34">system works with the Fed to help each</text>
  <text start="76.12" dur="4.32">other out and not help the people</text>
  <text start="78.22" dur="5.25">whatsoever but the story bat began back</text>
  <text start="80.44" dur="5.7">in January when the the website</text>
  <text start="83.47" dur="5.1">zerohedge which I know many of you know</text>
  <text start="86.14" dur="4.26">what zero hedges tweeted out an</text>
  <text start="88.57" dur="6.21">interesting note that they heard that</text>
  <text start="90.4" dur="6.9">the Houston office of the Dallas Fed met</text>
  <text start="94.78" dur="5.82">with some banks to push them on their</text>
  <text start="97.3" dur="5.49">dealings with energy industry and the</text>
  <text start="100.6" dur="4.71">Dallas Fed had met with these bangs and</text>
  <text start="102.79" dur="5.94">advised them to cover up major energy</text>
  <text start="105.31" dur="5.85">related losses now Dallas Fed refused to</text>
  <text start="108.73" dur="4.08">comment on the story they rejected all</text>
  <text start="111.16" dur="4.17">of this they said no this is not true</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="5.07">whatsoever and a couple days low it</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="4.5">later the story when all over the</text>
  <text start="117.88" dur="3.99">internet and the corporate media at this</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="4.8">point I had no choice but to start</text>
  <text start="121.87" dur="4.05">looking into it because it was gaining</text>
  <text start="124.63" dur="3.689">traction and looks like the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="125.92" dur="5.25">Journal Bloomberg started to look into</text>
  <text start="128.319" dur="6.511">it and everything that 0 heads has said</text>
  <text start="131.17" dur="8.37">has come true and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="8.46">that the Fed is manipulating banks</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="6.66">manipulating information on the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.29" dur="4.229">balance sheet manipulating pretty much</text>
  <text start="146.2" dur="5.039">everything now if we bring that all the</text>
  <text start="147.519" dur="5.791">way up to the Federal Reserve to the</text>
  <text start="151.239" dur="3.811">central banking system they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="3.929">doing this for a long time because we</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="4.53">see now that they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="157.239" dur="5.161">libor they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating gold and</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.5">silver which has just come out and they</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="4.07">pretty much</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="5.22">relate everything everything is a</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="6.01">product of the central bank all the</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="7.56">manipulation the illusion the bubbles</text>
  <text start="172.48" dur="8.67">and this is why it&amp;#39;s time to end the fed</text>
  <text start="176.86" dur="7.77">it does not serve the interest of the</text>
  <text start="181.15" dur="5.82">people it serves themselves and we could</text>
  <text start="184.63" dur="5.61">see right now that they need to do this</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="5.61">because their system that they depend on</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="5.31">that brings them a huge amount of wealth</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="4.92">is falling apart and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="4.35">all across the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="4.74">implementing zero percent interest rate</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="3.21">negative rates and of course the IMF is</text>
  <text start="202.24" dur="2.58">trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="3.84">negative interest rates is good for them</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="4.86">and whenever these people government</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="3.99">officials bankers central bankers come</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="3.3">out and tell us that this is good for</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="4.59">you we know it&amp;#39;s the opposite but we see</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="4.59">Denmark Belgium and now the Netherlands</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re pushing negative mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="217.57" dur="4.35">and it is spreading across Europe right</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="3.78">now because this is their only</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="5.94">alternative at this point because as the</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="6.36">system continually breaks apart they</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="5.43">can&amp;#39;t have interest rates moving up</text>
  <text start="230.89" dur="4.11">because the debt cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="3.66">everything is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="235" dur="3.39">at this time and we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="2.7">countries they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="3.629">this they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="4.95">the dollar is in its end game right now</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="4.261">and we see China right now making</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="3.54">bilateral trade agreements with many</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="3.929">many different countries we see do you</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="4.23">wan becoming a reserve currency the</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.621">one&amp;#39;s going to be backed by gold we see</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="6.48">hungry they announced that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="6.629">to be the first Eastern European country</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="5.25">to issue a you one denominated sovereign</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="6.151">bond we also see South Korea doing this</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="5.79">we see Nigeria which last week also said</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re going to do the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="269.89" dur="4.68">and this is starting to spread amongst</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="3.72">countries because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="274.57" dur="5.43">realize that we need to get away from</text>
  <text start="277" dur="6.479">the dollar and we see Russia&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="280" dur="5.13">China&amp;#39;s doing it India&amp;#39;s doing it Iran</text>
  <text start="283.479" dur="4.231">is going to be selling their oil not in</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="5.28">the dollar the other countries where the</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="5.61">people are rising up they are not going</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="4.11">to sell the oil reserves using the</text>
  <text start="293.32" dur="3.27">dollar they&amp;#39;re going to be using other</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="2.97">currencies gold silver whatever they are</text>
  <text start="296.59" dur="3.96">going to use</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="5.489">to barter or to sell their oil reserves</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="4.5">and this is really starting to spread</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="5.011">all over the world at this point because</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="4.709">we realize that the dollar is coming to</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="4.709">an end and the central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="309.759" dur="5.731">government know this at this point now</text>
  <text start="312.699" dur="6.631">we talked about Obamacare quite a bit</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="6.72">and companies now are looking at</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="4.83">Obamacare and a lot of them we saw</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="3.15">unitedhealthcare saying you know</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="2.849">something we&amp;#39;re going to need to get out</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="3.54">of this and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="327.009" dur="4.231">company saying that they might be</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="5.82">ditching their participation in the</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="5.76">marketplace and they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="4.169">increase prices dramatically because</text>
  <text start="337" dur="6.12">what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="338.889" dur="7.741">Obamacare once this was implemented they</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="7.019">are losing a lot of money rapidly and</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="4.77">this is a huge problem and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="3.18">starting to see that insurance companies</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="4.109">are saying we might have to invoke that</text>
  <text start="353.319" dur="4.261">bailout clause because this is not</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="3.84">working out and a lot of people are not</text>
  <text start="357.58" dur="3.57">joining up to Obamacare it is way too</text>
  <text start="359.349" dur="4.201">expensive the premiums are skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.31">and they&amp;#39;re looking at another increase</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="5.429">and also raising the deductibles once</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="5.13">again the CEO of insurance provider</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="4.861">Aetna continues to have serious concerns</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="5.699">about the sustainability of the public</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="5.46">exchanges a report issued by the Blue</text>
  <text start="377.289" dur="5.461">Cross Blue Shield found health insurers</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="7.26">gained a sicker more expensive patient</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="5.669">population once Obamacare went into</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="4.859">effect and what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this</text>
  <text start="388.419" dur="5.34">point is that Obamacare is a complete</text>
  <text start="391.419" dur="4.381">disaster it was never created for the</text>
  <text start="393.759" dur="3.991">people it was never created as a benefit</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="6.149">for the people it was created as a</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="5.94">revenue system to bring in tax dollars</text>
  <text start="401.949" dur="4.261">into the government to bring in revenue</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="3.96">into the insurance companies and if you</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="4.41">look how this thing whole thing was</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.319">structured they structured it where the</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="3.87">people would get the least amount of</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="7.2">benefit and the people would have to pay</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="6.69">the most into Obamacare and the</text>
  <text start="419.169" dur="5.161">insurance companies protected themselves</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="6.539">by having a bailout clause if it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.1">work out and this is how we can see that</text>
  <text start="427.719" dur="3.541">this was never never meant for the</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="4.86">people because as soon as it</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="6.12">was created and they said oh yes people</text>
  <text start="434.29" dur="6.99">have to start signing up we saw Congress</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="6.69">Obama the staffers all exempt from</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="4.92">Obamacare now if it&amp;#39;s so incredibly</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="4.89">great they should have been the first</text>
  <text start="446.2" dur="5.76">ones to say listen I&amp;#39;m signing up but</text>
  <text start="448.96" dur="5.61">guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen now we</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="6.15">understand that the FBI they were</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="5.73">pushing for months with this lawsuit</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="3.57">against apple to get the encryption key</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="3.78">so they can get into the San</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="5.43">Bernardino&amp;#39;s iphone which was a work</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="5.85">phone by the way so they finally dropped</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="5.88">the case against Apple they hacked into</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="5.67">the phone using an Israeli company and</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="4.71">of course John McAfee already proved</text>
  <text start="475.6" dur="3.42">that it&amp;#39;s very easy to hack into the</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="3.36">phone once you have the physical device</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="4.62">so they hacked into the phone and you</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6">know if they found so far after two</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="7.25">weeks of searching through it absolutely</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="7.34">nothing because we understand that this</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="6.85">operation was a complete false flag</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="5.35">operation and we knew that these two</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="4.53">people had nothing to do with it they</text>
  <text start="499.75" dur="5.28">were the patsies and this was a work</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="4.71">phone and if they can&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="3.6">within the last two weeks I mean how</text>
  <text start="506.98" dur="4.62">much data do you think is on this phone</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="5.4">I mean the iphones either come as you</text>
  <text start="511.6" dur="5.85">know eight gig i think this was a 5c an</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="5.85">eight gig 16 gig with 32 gig there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="517.45" dur="4.469">that much information on the phone in</text>
  <text start="519.88" dur="3.48">the first place because most of it is</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="4.321">the operating system a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="4.08">probably pictures or music and then you</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="2.91">have the rest of the space so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="3.36">really not that much information they</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="3.57">really have to go through so if they</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="3.3">haven&amp;#39;t found anything right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="2.79">never going to find anything unless they</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="3.12">make something up and they say oh yes</text>
  <text start="535.51" dur="3.99">this was on here but at this point it</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="3.6">looks like it&amp;#39;s a dead end which we all</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="4.5">knew from the beginning because we knew</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="6.36">their agenda was to get the keys to the</text>
  <text start="544" dur="6.63">kingdom to access all encryption that</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="5.16">was their agenda now out in Syria we see</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="3.9">the parliamentary elections their</text>
  <text start="552.34" dur="5.79">turnout was above fifty-seven percent</text>
  <text start="554.53" dur="6.18">which is very good in a war-torn country</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="5.73">and we see right now that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="560.71" dur="4.23">opposition they are rejecting the offer</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="3.54">oh</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="5.34">transitional period because what the</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="6.05">offer is from Assange government is that</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="5.37">Assad is going to say in power and</text>
  <text start="573.45" dur="3.64">during the transitional period the</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="3.99">opposition would choose three</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="4.53">vice-presidents and the opposition said</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="5.7">absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="5.61">this at all because we want Assad remove</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re not going to wait you know 18</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.53">months for the elections to come up to</text>
  <text start="589" dur="3.96">vote Assad in or out of power this is</text>
  <text start="591.76" dur="4.26">not going to work for us so the</text>
  <text start="592.96" dur="4.47">opposition right now is saying that even</text>
  <text start="596.02" dur="4.29">though we have a ceasefire and peace</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="6.12">talks right now we might start attacking</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="4.08">Assad forces so basically it looks like</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re going to be breaking the</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="4.08">ceasefire if they go ahead and do this</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="5.07">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about the</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="7.2">statements from Muhammad allouche who is</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="7.5">the opposition leader he is saying that</text>
  <text start="615.67" dur="6.75">Assad is going to leave office in four</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="5.1">months now this is very interesting for</text>
  <text start="622.42" dur="4.5">months because we&amp;#39;re in April right now</text>
  <text start="624.16" dur="6.62">four months brings us to August and we</text>
  <text start="626.92" dur="7.38">have seen in the last three years</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="7.48">something happened during the August</text>
  <text start="634.3" dur="7.71">month the sarin gas attack the Islamic</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="8.19">state coming into the Middle East in</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="6.33">Syria in Iraq the bombing of Syria just</text>
  <text start="646.45" dur="5.1">last year and now here we are again</text>
  <text start="648.34" dur="5.37">because we know Congress is in recess at</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="4.59">this time and this is when Obama the</text>
  <text start="653.71" dur="4.92">administration the neocons really work</text>
  <text start="656.14" dur="4.2">and it&amp;#39;s funny how they said for months</text>
  <text start="658.63" dur="6.9">because that leads us right up to the</text>
  <text start="660.34" dur="7.71">point where Congress goes on recess the</text>
  <text start="665.53" dur="5.01">everyone leaves and Obama pretty much</text>
  <text start="668.05" dur="4.289">has the reign of the entire situation</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="3.84">and he can do whatever he wants at that</text>
  <text start="672.339" dur="4.411">point because who&amp;#39;s going to question</text>
  <text start="674.38" dur="4.5">him because no one does anything until</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="5.31">after Labor Day so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.88" dur="5.67">preparing for that same scenario for</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="4.11">their plan to go active at that point</text>
  <text start="684.55" dur="4.89">and this is what we need to watch very</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="4.5">very carefully now we see it&amp;#39;s all over</text>
  <text start="689.44" dur="6.05">the internet all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="7.859">media that Congress is trying to push a</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="5.74">bill before the Senate</text>
  <text start="698.529" dur="5.16">and it&amp;#39;s to clarify that the immunity</text>
  <text start="701.23" dur="4.799">enjoyed by enjoyed by foreign nationals</text>
  <text start="703.689" dur="3.991">should not be applicable to cases where</text>
  <text start="706.029" dur="4.29">a nation is found responsible for a</text>
  <text start="707.68" dur="4.56">terrorist attack on American soil now</text>
  <text start="710.319" dur="3.991">the u.s. is out there saying that we</text>
  <text start="712.24" dur="3.93">have these 28 pages that Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="714.31" dur="3.629">did 911 and they&amp;#39;re continually saying</text>
  <text start="716.17" dur="2.76">this oh we&amp;#39;re not going to release them</text>
  <text start="717.939" dur="2.4">we are going to release some we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="2.909">going to release some and it looks like</text>
  <text start="720.339" dur="4.35">President Obama is going to say listen</text>
  <text start="721.839" dur="5.31">if this bill is passed I&amp;#39;m going to veto</text>
  <text start="724.689" dur="5.991">it and Saudi Arabia has come out and</text>
  <text start="727.149" dur="6.42">said okay if these 28 pages are released</text>
  <text start="730.68" dur="4.209">we&amp;#39;re going to destroy the economy of</text>
  <text start="733.569" dur="3.841">the United States we&amp;#39;re going to sell</text>
  <text start="734.889" dur="6.05">our assets and it&amp;#39;s in the billions</text>
  <text start="737.41" dur="5.64">actually probably in the trillions and</text>
  <text start="740.939" dur="5.56">because we don&amp;#39;t really know the full</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="6.149">accounting of what they have now this is</text>
  <text start="746.499" dur="4.38">all part of the brainwashing because</text>
  <text start="749.199" dur="6.091">really think about what they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="750.879" dur="6.33">us they&amp;#39;re telling us that for a very</text>
  <text start="755.29" dur="4.349">long time there&amp;#39;s 28 pages and it</text>
  <text start="757.209" dur="4.74">implicates Saudi Arabia brainwash</text>
  <text start="759.639" dur="5.791">brainwash you think it&amp;#39;s Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="761.949" dur="5.461">you think it&amp;#39;s Saudi Arabia now at this</text>
  <text start="765.43" dur="3.48">point they&amp;#39;ve already told you that it</text>
  <text start="767.41" dur="6.75">was Saudi Arabia and it&amp;#39;s in the 28</text>
  <text start="768.91" dur="6.869">pages then they keep going back and</text>
  <text start="774.16" dur="2.719">forth saying we&amp;#39;re going to release it</text>
  <text start="775.779" dur="3.631">we&amp;#39;re not going to release it now</text>
  <text start="776.879" dur="5.621">Congress is ready to pass some</text>
  <text start="779.41" dur="5.399">legislation that&amp;#39;s saying that we can go</text>
  <text start="782.5" dur="5.04">after these foreign nationals and go</text>
  <text start="784.809" dur="5.46">after different countries now Saudi</text>
  <text start="787.54" dur="6.18">Arabia just admitted their guilt if</text>
  <text start="790.269" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re going to counter with destroying</text>
  <text start="793.72" dur="5.07">the economy of the United States look</text>
  <text start="796.029" dur="7.201">what they&amp;#39;re doing here right now this</text>
  <text start="798.79" dur="6.69">is all an illusion to convince the</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="5.82">American people that it was Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="805.48" dur="4.89">now was Saudi Arabia involved in it they</text>
  <text start="809.05" dur="2.759">might have had a hand in it but it makes</text>
  <text start="810.37" dur="3.809">no sense why they would do this because</text>
  <text start="811.809" dur="4.171">all as they&amp;#39;re showing all they have to</text>
  <text start="814.179" dur="3.691">do is sell their assets and they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="4.919">able to destroy the United States they</text>
  <text start="817.87" dur="5.25">become very very wealthy with working</text>
  <text start="820.899" dur="5.1">with the United States at this point so</text>
  <text start="823.12" dur="4.38">what is the reason all of this is coming</text>
  <text start="825.999" dur="4.351">out while it&amp;#39;s to take all our eyes off</text>
  <text start="827.5" dur="4.47">of the real perpetrators of who really</text>
  <text start="830.35" dur="4.2">did this because</text>
  <text start="831.97" dur="6.27">if you think about it if this goes</text>
  <text start="834.55" dur="7.8">forward and congress passes the</text>
  <text start="838.24" dur="8.94">legislation the investigation is going</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="7.099">to lead to places where the US</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="5.969">government doesn&amp;#39;t want it to go and</text>
  <text start="849.449" dur="5.56">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been using these 28</text>
  <text start="853.149" dur="3.81">pages i think this is a complete hoax</text>
  <text start="855.009" dur="4.56">because once the corporate media jumps</text>
  <text start="856.959" dur="4.351">on it once saudi arabia is brought into</text>
  <text start="859.569" dur="4.231">it saying hey we&amp;#39;re going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="861.31" dur="4.92">economy if you do this i mean it makes</text>
  <text start="863.8" dur="6.05">no sense at this point to even release</text>
  <text start="866.23" dur="6">him because Saudi Arabia is out there</text>
  <text start="869.85" dur="4.179">telling you that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="4.109">destroy the economy if the pages are</text>
  <text start="874.029" dur="5.941">released so everything is already out in</text>
  <text start="876.339" dur="6.031">the open so what are they really afraid</text>
  <text start="879.97" dur="5.07">of they&amp;#39;re not afraid of releasing the</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="7.23">28 pages they&amp;#39;re afraid of a real</text>
  <text start="885.04" dur="9.049">investigation delving into what really</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="8.58">happened who is really responsible and</text>
  <text start="894.089" dur="7.021">bringing those individuals to trial</text>
  <text start="898.18" dur="6.389">because if the legislation is passed</text>
  <text start="901.11" dur="5.949">they can go after any foreign nation</text>
  <text start="904.569" dur="7.44">that might have been involved in this</text>
  <text start="907.059" dur="6.63">they can go internally and launch an</text>
  <text start="912.009" dur="5.221">investigation to find out who in the</text>
  <text start="913.689" dur="8.25">United States was involved in this crime</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="6.12">and we see at this point this is what</text>
  <text start="921.939" dur="3.57">they really don&amp;#39;t want to happen and</text>
  <text start="923.35" dur="4.229">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing the threats</text>
  <text start="925.509" dur="4.791">Saudi Arabia was instructed to make this</text>
  <text start="927.579" dur="5.221">threat because if this is passed and</text>
  <text start="930.3" dur="4.409">they have enough votes where the</text>
  <text start="932.8" dur="4.56">president can&amp;#39;t veto this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="934.709" dur="3.641">they will use an event to cover this up</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="3.75">because they don&amp;#39;t want this information</text>
  <text start="938.35" dur="4.83">coming out and at this point the economy</text>
  <text start="941.11" dur="5.31">might be destroyed at this point we</text>
  <text start="943.18" dur="5.699">might see an event to go to war anything</text>
  <text start="946.42" dur="4.83">they possibly can do to take all eyes</text>
  <text start="948.879" dur="6.241">off of this remember they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="951.25" dur="5.91">afraid of the threat to their authority</text>
  <text start="955.12" dur="3.659">to their power they don&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="957.16" dur="3.72">being brought down so they will use</text>
  <text start="958.779" dur="5.641">anything they possibly can to cover up</text>
  <text start="960.88" dur="4.59">what they&amp;#39;ve done and we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="964.42" dur="3.39">the past I mean this</text>
  <text start="965.47" dur="4.83">is nothing new but I believe these 28</text>
  <text start="967.81" dur="5.91">pages the threat from Saudi Arabia at</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="5.43">this time this is a complete hoax this</text>
  <text start="973.72" dur="5.28">is to take all eyes of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="975.73" dur="5.22">going on here and it&amp;#39;s being used to</text>
  <text start="979" dur="5.1">protect those who are really responsible</text>
  <text start="980.95" dur="4.86">for what happened in 911 listen everyone</text>
