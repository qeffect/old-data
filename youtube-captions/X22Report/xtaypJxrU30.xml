  <text start="70.63" dur="4.95">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.3" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the Fed in the</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="3.99">last couple of weeks and how Trump is</text>
  <text start="77.59" dur="4.56">coming out and criticizing the Fed</text>
  <text start="79.57" dur="4.86">saying that the Fed is raising rates too</text>
  <text start="82.15" dur="5.49">rapidly this is not a good thing now</text>
  <text start="84.43" dur="5.64">this is all part of the plan and we know</text>
  <text start="87.64" dur="5.79">that the Fed is the biggest threat to</text>
  <text start="90.07" dur="4.5">the American people a little bit later</text>
  <text start="93.43" dur="3.92">in this report we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="94.57" dur="6.27">about what Trump came out and said and</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="8.32">you can tell that he is going after the</text>
  <text start="100.84" dur="8.07">Fed that this entire plan has been set</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="6.18">up for a very long time and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.91" dur="6.72">pushing the agenda forward to remove the</text>
  <text start="111.85" dur="7.59">Fed remove the deep state and reset the</text>
  <text start="115.63" dur="6.54">entire economic system not just the</text>
  <text start="119.44" dur="7.319">economic system but reset the economic</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="8.61">system the government system the entire</text>
  <text start="126.759" dur="7.321">world system and we can see that we are</text>
  <text start="130.78" dur="6.9">headed in this direction and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="6.42">interesting is that the global economy</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="4.77">is breaking down very very rapidly I</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="3.72">mean we&amp;#39;re looking at many different</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="2.88">indicators yes if you go into the</text>
  <text start="144.22" dur="2.91">mainstream media they&amp;#39;re gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="145.33" dur="5.1">you know the economy&amp;#39;s back and</text>
  <text start="147.13" dur="5.28">everything is great this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="4.58">has been putting out there and this is</text>
  <text start="152.41" dur="5.61">what he wants everyone reporting on</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.809">except those mainstream media stations</text>
  <text start="158.02" dur="5.01">that don&amp;#39;t want to report on that but</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="6.301">he&amp;#39;s forcing everyone to say to look at</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="6.63">him and say the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="6.15">fantastically he needs everyone to</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="6.45">understand that this is what the economy</text>
  <text start="172.27" dur="6.99">is doing this way when the economy</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="6.42">breaks down and falls apart he can turn</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="6.33">around and point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="5.31">organization that did this because he</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="5.07">can say I palm</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.92">up the economy it&amp;#39;s fantastic look who</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="4.2">brought it down and this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="3.99">getting prepared to do but when we look</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="3.78">at the global economy and not just the</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="2.97">global economy but the economy in the US</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="3.15">and we look at all the different</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="5.31">indicators we can see that it is</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="5.279">breaking down in every different</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="4.349">economic sector now we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="207.069" dur="3.691">the economy for quite a while and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="209.379" dur="3.411">been looking at all different of</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="5.789">different sectors we&amp;#39;ve been analyzing</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="5.35">them ripping them apart showing how it</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="4.53">was manipulated and this was all on</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="3.99">purpose so later on when everything</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="3.091">started to fall apart we could</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="4.32">understand what was going on here so we</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="4.5">could prepare for what was about to</text>
  <text start="226.45" dur="4.31">happen and that is the entire system</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="4.679">being transitioned to a brand new system</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="3.61">and for those people who think well</text>
  <text start="233.349" dur="2.311">we&amp;#39;re never gonna go through a</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="3.53">transition we&amp;#39;ve gone through</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="5.34">transitions many many times before and</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="4.99">if you go back in history you can see</text>
  <text start="241" dur="4.379">those transitions some were a lot worse</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="5.159">than others most of them had some may be</text>
  <text start="245.379" dur="4.92">some type of war around it to cover it</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="4.741">up this time it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little</text>
  <text start="250.299" dur="4.41">different hopefully because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="5.129">have those individuals in power right</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="5.4">now to push a war and we can see that we</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="3.781">are definitely heading for a transition</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="3.93">but when we look at the different</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="4.14">economic indicators here in the US and</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="3.861">around the world we see things that are</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="6.99">definitely are definitely falling apart</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="7.48">look at the global car sales I mean this</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="5.58">is a global Carmageddon right now and</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="6.96">the wave is spreading across the world</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="8.25">and two weeks ago we talked about how</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="8.09">the US had terrible auto sales now we</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="7.229">see that China their passenger car</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="7.14">dealerships plunged by 12% and we see</text>
  <text start="293.889" dur="9.691">European car sales they have plunged by</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="7.659">23% now this is not a good sign and I</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="4.98">know there&amp;#39;s new tests in Europe and</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="5.071">things like that but once again it would</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.579">only happen in certain areas we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="7.41">seeing it everywhere it&amp;#39;s all happening</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="6.121">at once now if we look in the US and we</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="3.679">look at the housing market once again we</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="3.529">see housing star</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="7.08">they have collapsed in September they</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="8.18">slumped by 5.3% permit they also dropped</text>
  <text start="328.469" dur="6.561">for the fifth month of the last six and</text>
  <text start="331.969" dur="5.44">the situation in the housing market is</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="4.27">collapsing very very rapidly right now</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="3.63">and why is this happening well you have</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="4.139">to remember the Fed is raising interest</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="3.93">rates as you raise interest rates those</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.621">people who are making a certain income</text>
  <text start="344.969" dur="5.01">who wanted a certain price house they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="5.25">thrown out of the market they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="4.44">afford that house anymore and most of</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="2.46">the people say well you know something</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="2.641">I&amp;#39;m just gonna wait and they get</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="3.03">themselves out of the market and they</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="4.039">don&amp;#39;t want to shop around for a house</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="5.22">and as the rates continually move up</text>
  <text start="361.099" dur="5.651">well that&amp;#39;s a lot less people who want</text>
  <text start="364.02" dur="4.829">to buy if there&amp;#39;s a lot less people who</text>
  <text start="366.75" dur="5.25">want to buy then lending is gonna</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="5.13">decline and if lending is declining then</text>
  <text start="372" dur="3.389">those people who are selling they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.979" dur="2.821">gonna be taking those houses off the</text>
  <text start="375.389" dur="3.421">market because they don&amp;#39;t see traffic</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="4.139">and people are gonna ask for the price</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="4.74">of the house to come down so they can</text>
  <text start="380.939" dur="6.331">actually purchase it I mean the whole</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="7.47">thing is repeating what happened in 2006</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="5.459">2007 2008 and right now we can see that</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="2.94">single-family starts they drop by four</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="4.47">five point three percent</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="5.069">single units down are down negative</text>
  <text start="397.199" dur="3.93">point nine percent multifamily starts</text>
  <text start="399.029" dur="4.86">are crashing by negative twelve point</text>
  <text start="401.129" dur="4.32">nine percent and if we look at mortgage</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="3.9">applications and this all fits in</text>
  <text start="405.449" dur="4.44">together we can see that mortgage</text>
  <text start="407.789" dur="5.28">applications they collapse by seven</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="5.821">point one percent last week and mortgage</text>
  <text start="413.069" dur="5.671">rates topped around five percent and</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="8.819">when you look at this you can see over</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="9.229">time since 2011 2012 we are headed in a</text>
  <text start="424.529" dur="6.151">downward trajectory which means</text>
  <text start="427.969" dur="5.651">applications are declining right now</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="6.209">Bank of America sees at Wells Fargo sees</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="6.03">it and many other banks see it and what</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="5.631">this means is the economy is breaking</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="4.799">down because the housing industry</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="4.69">connects to many different other</text>
  <text start="444.449" dur="7.02">industries electrical plumbing copper</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="5.03">asphalt cement lumber you name it</text>
  <text start="451.469" dur="2.181">a</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="3.829">connects to all these different areas</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="4.98">and then it connects to home furnishing</text>
  <text start="456.069" dur="5.291">durable goods which is washers dryers</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="5.099">dishwashers refrigerators and things</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="5.82">like that so it&amp;#39;s all interconnected and</text>
  <text start="463.729" dur="6.87">you can see if one thing goes everything</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="6.78">starts to go and what has Trump been</text>
  <text start="470.599" dur="4.44">doing Trump has been transitioning the</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="3.44">u.s. right now</text>
  <text start="475.039" dur="5.341">and he&amp;#39;s been spending a lot of money</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="6.419">and he&amp;#39;s using the central bankers money</text>
  <text start="480.38" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s using their weapon against them</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="4.241">think about it</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s almost like what China did they</text>
  <text start="488.06" dur="6.079">used this free money that was out there</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="6.32">and they built cities they built</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="7.451">anything they could possibly build and</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="7.539">ran up debts Trump right now is doing</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="4.049">the same thing trying to build up the</text>
  <text start="504.349" dur="4.801">infrastructure trying to build up</text>
  <text start="505.639" dur="5.581">manufacturing pushing out the globalist</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="6.24">deals making bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="511.22" dur="6.449">and in the meantime the debt is moving</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="3.72">up very very quickly it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="517.669" dur="5.401">different than what Obama was doing</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="5.28">because Trump&amp;#39;s mission not just him but</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="4.95">other people that are working with him</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="6.48">is to bring down the central bank system</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="4.259">and you can see that the debt level is</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="4.529">around twenty one point six five</text>
  <text start="532.279" dur="3.781">trillion and it is moving up very very</text>
  <text start="535.399" dur="2.88">quickly</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="4.23">this whole debt ceiling thing that you</text>
  <text start="538.279" dur="4.381">know Congress put into place that is a</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.98">complete and utter joke right now the</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="4.89">Trump administration they&amp;#39;ve notifies</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="4.8">conte they notify Congress of their</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="6.83">intent to negotiate three separate</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="9.24">bilateral trade agreements this is with</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="7.6">Britain the European Union and Japan so</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="3.089">US Trade Representative Robert light</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="2.64">Houser</text>
  <text start="562.399" dur="4.56">said that the administration notified</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="4.55">Congress of its intent to negotiate the</text>
  <text start="566.959" dur="4.051">three separate trade agreements and</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="2.979">they&amp;#39;re going to do it just like they</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="4.73">did the north american free trade</text>
  <text start="572.149" dur="5.851">agreement with Canada and Mexico and</text>
  <text start="575.74" dur="5.2">basically what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="578" dur="6.57">is they&amp;#39;re setting up individual trade</text>
  <text start="580.94" dur="5.07">agreements where it&amp;#39;s not centralized in</text>
  <text start="584.57" dur="6.09">one place under</text>
  <text start="586.01" dur="8.1">a centralized system like TPP or NAFTA</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="5.49">or anything like that China actually is</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="3.72">doing the same exact thing Russia is</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="4.56">doing the same exact thing were they</text>
  <text start="597.83" dur="7.92">making bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="600.71" dur="8.22">each country completely decentralized so</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="6.06">you can see where they are headed right</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="5.64">now and we talked about how Trump has</text>
  <text start="611.81" dur="5.73">been contradicting the Fed over and over</text>
  <text start="614.57" dur="7.47">and over and he was doing an interview</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="7.26">on Fox Business and he said the</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="4.38">following my biggest threat is the Fed</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="4.86">because the Fed is raising rates too</text>
  <text start="626.42" dur="7.86">fast and it&amp;#39;s too independent</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="7.98">take a listen biggest threat is the Fed</text>
  <text start="634.28" dur="5.55">because the Fed is raising rates too</text>
  <text start="637.64" dur="4.29">fast and it&amp;#39;s independent so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="639.83" dur="3.87">speak to him but I&amp;#39;m not happy with what</text>
  <text start="641.93" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s doing because it&amp;#39;s going to fist</text>
  <text start="643.7" dur="4.08">because you looked at the last inflation</text>
  <text start="645.71" dur="2.49">numbers they&amp;#39;re very low but you put</text>
  <text start="647.78" dur="2.67">them there</text>
  <text start="648.2" dur="5.22">I mean think about Janet Yellen oh well</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="5.82">she&amp;#39;s gonna be honest I&amp;#39;m not blaming</text>
  <text start="653.42" dur="5.1">anybody I put him there and maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.27" dur="3.84">right maybe it&amp;#39;s wrong but everything I</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="3.3">put so a couple of other people there</text>
  <text start="660.11" dur="3.27">that I&amp;#39;m not so happy with too but for</text>
  <text start="661.82" dur="4.47">the most part I&amp;#39;m very happy with people</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="6.66">you can see he&amp;#39;s continually out there</text>
  <text start="666.29" dur="5.64">and he just signaled that the Fed is the</text>
  <text start="670.04" dur="4.95">biggest threat and he brought in the</text>
  <text start="671.93" dur="5.58">word independent they&amp;#39;re too independent</text>
  <text start="674.99" dur="7.58">so he doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="8.43">ah very interesting he&amp;#39;s laying</text>
  <text start="682.57" dur="6.72">breadcrumbs out there in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="685.94" dur="5.36">media letting the people know that</text>

  <text start="703.51" dur="6.45">the idea that the Fed is a problem these</text>
  <text start="707.14" dur="5.67">people have done something where you</text>

  <text start="727.54" dur="4.83">done the plan is to blame it on the Fed</text>
  <text start="730.03" dur="4.41">now he&amp;#39;s already said the Fed is a</text>
  <text start="732.37" dur="7.98">threat the Fed is too independent and</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="9.15">this is bread for the audit think about</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="6.39">it if the economy is doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="743.59" dur="4.77">and everything is going great and the</text>
  <text start="746.74" dur="3.6">Fed is raising rates and we know what</text>
  <text start="748.36" dur="4.62">happens when the Fed raised rates the</text>
  <text start="750.34" dur="5.04">economy breaks down and when the economy</text>
  <text start="752.98" dur="4.05">breaks down and it it&amp;#39;s already starting</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="3.99">to break down forget about the</text>
  <text start="757.03" dur="3.69">unemployment numbers forget about the</text>
  <text start="759.37" dur="3.39">stock the stock market has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="760.72" dur="4.47">with the economy by the way forget about</text>
  <text start="762.76" dur="4.26">the GDP numbers those are all</text>
  <text start="765.19" dur="4.71">manipulated to make everyone think the</text>
  <text start="767.02" dur="5.04">economy&amp;#39;s doing well and when you hear</text>
  <text start="769.9" dur="3.72">all these numbers they&amp;#39;re very easy to</text>
  <text start="772.06" dur="3.12">manipulate and make them look a lot</text>
  <text start="773.62" dur="4.35">better than they really are I mean all</text>
  <text start="775.18" dur="5.1">he did was GDP shifted a trillion</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="4.23">dollars and made each GDP look fantastic</text>
  <text start="780.28" dur="4.59">when Obama&amp;#39;s president they went all the</text>
  <text start="782.2" dur="5.04">way back to 1930 changed the calculation</text>
  <text start="784.87" dur="4.44">added in research and development and</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="4.2">then recalculated GDP all the way up to</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="4.81">the present day</text>
  <text start="791.44" dur="4.72">unemployment very easy those people who</text>
  <text start="794.12" dur="2.969">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview for what</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="2.64">four weeks</text>
  <text start="797.089" dur="4.381">you&amp;#39;re just not counted you don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="4.56">job of course they want a job so guess</text>
  <text start="801.47" dur="3.119">what you go into a bucket where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.36" dur="2.7">not looking you don&amp;#39;t want a job you</text>
  <text start="804.589" dur="2.641">don&amp;#39;t to support your family you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="806.06" dur="3.54">want to go on trips you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="807.23" dur="4.71">live a nice life you rather have no job</text>
  <text start="809.6" dur="4.38">whatsoever and recalculate the</text>
  <text start="811.94" dur="3.839">unemployment numbers without millions</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="3.99">and millions of people and guess what</text>
  <text start="815.779" dur="3.81">you get a nice unemployment number I</text>
  <text start="817.97" dur="3.36">mean that&amp;#39;s all it is</text>
  <text start="819.589" dur="5.281">so those numbers are absolutely</text>
  <text start="821.33" dur="5.94">meaningless I mean you go back to 2008</text>
  <text start="824.87" dur="4.83">unemployment was like the lowest we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="4.77">seen stock market was at like 14,000</text>
  <text start="829.7" dur="4.62">points all-time new highs and there were</text>
  <text start="832.04" dur="4.86">people looking at the subprime security</text>
  <text start="834.32" dur="4.74">saying we have a problem here these are</text>
  <text start="836.9" dur="5.34">garbage but no one wanted to believe</text>
  <text start="839.06" dur="5.01">because why the rating agency said</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re a triple-a so if they say</text>
  <text start="844.07" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re triple-a that must be the truth</text>
  <text start="847.31" dur="3.84">and those people looking at the subprime</text>
  <text start="849.35" dur="3.39">securities that must be a lie</text>
  <text start="851.15" dur="3.65">so everyone ignored it everyone laughed</text>
  <text start="852.74" dur="5.43">at them everyone said they&amp;#39;re fools</text>
  <text start="854.8" dur="5.5">until the system came crashing down they</text>
  <text start="858.17" dur="3.96">were proved right and they made billions</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="3.81">and billions of dollars off of it</text>
  <text start="862.13" dur="2.55">because they knew exactly what was going</text>
  <text start="864.11" dur="3.57">to happen</text>
  <text start="864.68" dur="6.81">did they know the timing no could they</text>
  <text start="867.68" dur="6.599">predict the timing no but they knew</text>
  <text start="871.49" dur="5.25">eventually it would all come tumbling</text>
  <text start="874.279" dur="5.821">down the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="5.43">now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the data</text>
  <text start="880.1" dur="4.859">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at what&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="5.31">on way before the mainstream media was</text>
  <text start="884.959" dur="5.161">out there now saying you know Real</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="4.95">Estate&amp;#39;s not doing well you know Trump&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="892.43" dur="3.69">numbers of the economy and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="894.08" dur="3.449">doing they&amp;#39;re doing that now because</text>
  <text start="896.12" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re trying to create a narrative</text>
  <text start="897.529" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re trying to build something which</text>
  <text start="899" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s a dead end for them right now</text>
  <text start="900.74" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re too late to the party here we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="903.23" dur="3.66">been looking at it for a very long time</text>
  <text start="904.55" dur="5.22">and we understand what the economy is</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="4.56">doing and what the Fed was trying to do</text>
  <text start="909.77" dur="3.36">what the deep state was trying to do and</text>
  <text start="911.45" dur="3.87">now everything has turned around since</text>
  <text start="913.13" dur="4.35">Trump came into office and we can see</text>

  <text start="922.28" dur="4.62">down the central bank</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="6.15">and here we are today and Trump is</text>
  <text start="926.9" dur="7.14">continually out there trying to educate</text>
  <text start="929.84" dur="7.11">the people about the fed why they are</text>
  <text start="934.04" dur="3.6">such a threat why he doesn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="936.95" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re doing because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.64" dur="6.02">independent this is all for a specific</text>
  <text start="940.43" dur="5.84">reason and the reason is the plan</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="4.71">so we are gonna go through this</text>
