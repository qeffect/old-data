  <text start="91.399" dur="6.181">Trump introduced into the economy is</text>
  <text start="94" dur="5.229">really taking effect and we all knew</text>
  <text start="97.58" dur="5.87">that this was going to happen we knew</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="8.341">that once the Fed started to cut rates</text>
  <text start="103.45" dur="7.06">they started to push stimulus what was</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="5.549">going to happen to the market the market</text>
  <text start="110.51" dur="6.08">was going to continually move up and up</text>
  <text start="113.119" dur="6.721">and up the mainstream media knew this</text>
  <text start="116.59" dur="5.56">the financial planners knew this but</text>
  <text start="119.84" dur="4.86">they spun it to make it think like to</text>
  <text start="122.15" dur="7.2">make everyone think like if the rates</text>
  <text start="124.7" dur="7.52">are cut and their stimulus we go into a</text>
  <text start="129.35" dur="6.09">recession because cutting the rates</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="6.13">causes a recession no that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="135.44" dur="5.549">happens raising the rates in a</text>
  <text start="138.35" dur="6.21">manipulated economy brings us to a</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="7.711">tipping point once we hit the tipping</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="6.51">point the Fed then drops the rate so it</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="4.89">looks like dropping the rates actually</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="5.79">caused it but in the beginning it was</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="6.81">actually the rates moving up that</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="5.42">brought the economy over the edge which</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="5.18">made the stock market come</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="7.26">down and we see this route history Trump</text>
  <text start="165.58" dur="7.14">and the Patriots they stopped everything</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="5.34">before we hit that tipping point the Fed</text>
  <text start="172.72" dur="7.56">was planning on hitting that tipping</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="7.8">point in 2019 and hopefully after they</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.47">hit the tipping point going into 2020</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="3.54">the entire thing would collapse why do</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="4.19">you think the mainstream media was out</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="7.86">there why do you think they were pushing</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="7.6">recession so hard that&amp;#39;s why and then</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="7.14">when it didn&amp;#39;t happen they were hoping</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="6.63">to create it before Trump was able to</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="4.91">get the Fed to cut rate and start</text>
  <text start="203.17" dur="6.63">stimulus it is all completely failed and</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="5.98">yes as we discussed many times before</text>
  <text start="209.8" dur="4.56">the stock market all that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="212.11" dur="5.49">today has nothing to do with the real</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="7.32">economy we&amp;#39;re in an illusionary economy</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="7.44">Trump is using the illusionary rules to</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="5.55">help what he needs to do he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="4.229">the following another record stock</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="4.17">market 21 times this year despite an</text>
  <text start="229.269" dur="4.321">ongoing and totally unfounded witch-hunt</text>
  <text start="231.4" dur="5.61">and a democratic party that would love</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="5.61">to see a nice big juicy recession in</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="3.36">actuality the potential for the United</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="4.289">States is unlimited</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="7.2">we will power through the do-nothing</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="6.121">Dems and they would like to receipt see</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="4.229">a recession they would like to have a</text>
  <text start="249.61" dur="4.23">recession because this would give them</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="4.141">the ability to remove Trump because they</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="4.35">would blame it on Trump and going into</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="2.88">the elections people would be very very</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="2.729">upset</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="6.15">Trump knew this the Patriots knew this</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="6.511">and they stopped it dead in its tracks</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="4.14">and now the mainstream media now the</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="3.9">financial pundants now the Dems now the</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="5.61">deep state now the central bank what are</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="3.87">they gonna do they can&amp;#39;t do anything at</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="3.259">this point</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="4.89">Trump controls the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="3.94">and guess what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to the</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="3.24">stock market guess what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="3.141">with peace with people&amp;#39;s pensions what</text>

  <text start="285.06" dur="6.72">statistically the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="7.77">look amazing and they can&amp;#39;t stop it and</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="6.13">this is what they&amp;#39;re pissed off about</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="3.6">and what else is Trump doing well the</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="3.8">Patriots</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="7.41">they are creating these new trade deals</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="6.06">they have allowed the poultry farmers to</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="6.27">regain access to China</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="8.16">USTR tweeted out the fallen American</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="5.73">poultry farmers regain access to China</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="4.81">let me just read a little bit part of</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="5.34">what they wrote here this is great news</text>
  <text start="320.74" dur="5.52">for both America&amp;#39;s farmers and China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="4.979">consumers China is an important export</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="4.83">market for America&amp;#39;s poultry farmers and</text>
  <text start="328.419" dur="5.131">we estimate they will now be able to</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="4.62">export more than 1 billion worth of</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="7.679">poultry and poultry products each year</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="7.44">to China helping the farmers and now</text>
  <text start="341.229" dur="6.931">we&amp;#39;re getting word that the China deal</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="6.48">is very close to being finalized Kudlow</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="3.72">told the audience at a Council of</text>
  <text start="349.63" dur="5.46">Foreign Relations event that the two</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="5.52">sides are getting close to a deal saying</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="6.42">that the countries have been recently</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="8.13">engaged in very constructive talks which</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="6.6">is good news because what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="4.83">happen at this point a deal is going to</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="5.4">be made phase 1 will be complete</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="5.279">some tariffs if Trump decides will be</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="5.49">removed most likely he will decide to do</text>
  <text start="375.639" dur="6.511">this what happens to the central bank at</text>
  <text start="379" dur="6.69">this point well their entire narrative</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="6.57">starts to fall apart doesn&amp;#39;t it Trump</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="6.12">the Patriots they have had all of this</text>
  <text start="388.72" dur="6.06">plan since the beginning and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="5.01">starting to play out now as we know</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="5.759">today we had the impeachment going on</text>
  <text start="396.82" dur="8.219">and Nancy Pelosi is holding the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="400.539" dur="7.861">in her back pocket and she&amp;#39;s waiting for</text>
  <text start="405.039" dur="5.761">the right moment to vote on it now she</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="6.51">doesn&amp;#39;t want to do it too early because</text>
  <text start="410.8" dur="7.29">if that was voted on too early and it</text>
  <text start="414.91" dur="6.21">allowed companies to prosper people to</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="6.44">get jobs and things to really flow it</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="5.76">would hurt the chances of the deep State</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="3.5">because the economy would look stronger</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="4.63">than ever but</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="5.61">NEADS the USMC a to show that even</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="5.52">though that were impeaching and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="433.64" dur="8.67">going well at least we can show that we</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="8.61">voted for a YES on the USMC a to try to</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="5.7">save whatever she can save and to show</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="5.88">the American people that look we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.01" dur="4.83">doing something very good here and I</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.03">think she&amp;#39;s holding this in her back</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="3.24">pocket and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="3.78">plays out because as we can see the</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="4.98">impeachment is not going very well now</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that we know</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="5.16">that the that the Patriots are gonna go</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="5.6">after the source of the problem the</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="6.63">source is the central bank the source</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="7.63">creates corruption it makes people</text>
  <text start="472.85" dur="6.78">greedy it allows certain individuals to</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="6.24">continually borrow and borrow and borrow</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="5.51">and have these funds distributed to</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="4.2">other places never to be seen again</text>
  <text start="485.14" dur="4.6">because there&amp;#39;s no checks and balances</text>
  <text start="487.28" dur="4.44">now of course this is the government</text>
  <text start="489.74" dur="3.93">this is those individuals within</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="4.5">government they become very greedy they</text>
  <text start="493.67" dur="4.17">start making these deals and they say</text>
  <text start="496.22" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t worry I can get the funds for that</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="6.78">and they say okay with this rider on</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="5.64">this amendment on this bill we can get</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="3.2">the money now of course the money</text>
  <text start="506.6" dur="4.92">doesn&amp;#39;t go to the project the project</text>
  <text start="507.82" dur="5.17">usually ends up failing and the money is</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="5.13">siphoned off someplace else and these</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="6.36">people become very very wealthy well it</text>
  <text start="516.65" dur="4.89">looks like the Federal Reserve chair</text>
  <text start="519.35" dur="7.59">when he was testifying in front of</text>
  <text start="521.54" dur="8.58">Congress told them that you need to get</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="4.94">everything under control because the</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="6.12">federal budget deficits are</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="7.9">unsustainable now think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="6.6">saying and why would he say this now is</text>
  <text start="539.78" dur="5.97">it him who&amp;#39;s saying this or is it Trump</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="6.41">who is saying this through the Federal</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="7.17">Reserve this is an economic warning</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="7.83">letting everyone know that what Congress</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="7.51">has been doing for all of these years</text>
  <text start="557.08" dur="5.69">cannot be sustained now</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="3.78">could trump just come out and say this</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="2.07">yeah but everyone would just yeah</text>
  <text start="564.21" dur="3.69">whatever</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="5.52">nope we&amp;#39;re not listening to him we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="4.32">trying to impeach him but if the Federal</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="4.55">Reserve comes out and says and remember</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="4.92">the mainstream media the deep state</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been praising the Federal</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="7.44">Reserve since its inception</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="9.16">they don&amp;#39;t counter it so if the Chairman</text>
  <text start="584.58" dur="8.37">is saying this to Congress they take it</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="5.25">seriously or people hear this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="4.26">reported in the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="5.45">people say oh well the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="5.37">just like they said there&amp;#39;s no recession</text>
  <text start="600.02" dur="5.35">you need to get things under control and</text>
  <text start="602.58" dur="6.66">remember everything is different right</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="5.67">now I know before when Obama was in</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="3.45">there Bush was in there Clinton was in</text>
  <text start="611.04" dur="5.91">there and we can go all the way back in</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="7.32">time we have an individual now in the</text>
  <text start="616.95" dur="5.91">office of the presidency that is</text>
  <text start="620.01" dur="6.51">completely undoing everything the</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="5.79">globalists have done Trump is looking to</text>
  <text start="626.52" dur="5.49">put those individuals that believe in</text>
  <text start="628.65" dur="5.97">gold and sound money on the board q has</text>
  <text start="632.01" dur="5.1">been telling us that the Fed is going to</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="5.52">be restructured gold will break debt</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="5.76">will bring down the Fed what we are</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="6.63">watching right now is a complete set up</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="8.37">of not just the central bank but those</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="9.93">individuals that have been borrowing and</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="8.04">borrowing siphoning hiding and becoming</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="6.12">very wealthy over a very long period of</text>
  <text start="659.28" dur="5.58">time I do believe that this warning was</text>
  <text start="662.82" dur="6">to let everyone know that this is coming</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="7.56">to an end and with this warning you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="7.71">gonna see a lot of people resign because</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="6.09">they know what&amp;#39;s coming now very</text>
  <text start="676.53" dur="4.59">interestingly we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="4.02">before we know that Trump understands</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="4.35">the consumer he understands how the</text>
  <text start="682.53" dur="5.04">system works he has the magic one yes he</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="5.21">knows about the manipulation he also</text>
  <text start="687.57" dur="6.459">knows that if he continually cuts taxes</text>
  <text start="690.68" dur="8.43">and allows people to have more funds</text>
  <text start="694.029" dur="9.31">since 70% is spending what happens to</text>
  <text start="699.11" dur="6.99">the GDP numbers well they go up and</text>
  <text start="703.339" dur="6.54">guess what he&amp;#39;s proposing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="8.94">proposing a cut for middle income tax</text>
  <text start="709.879" dur="8.671">rates to 15% what do you think this is</text>
  <text start="715.04" dur="5.039">going to do to the GDP now if he does</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="5.129">this by the end of this year or the</text>
  <text start="720.079" dur="5.37">beginning of next year 2020 is going to</text>
  <text start="723.679" dur="4.5">look amazing he&amp;#39;s going to have the</text>

  <text start="732.86" dur="8.849">does this do this creates a block</text>
