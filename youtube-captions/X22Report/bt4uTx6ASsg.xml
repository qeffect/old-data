  <text start="33.48" dur="4.829">and the title of this episode is gold</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="6.121">slammed down could lead to an horrific</text>
  <text start="38.309" dur="5.64">event days from now and the reason why i</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="4.32">say this is because we have to go back</text>
  <text start="43.949" dur="5.311">in time if we go back to April twelfth</text>
  <text start="46.5" dur="6.18">of this year gold was pushed down around</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="6.77">two hundred dollars or so and three days</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="6.93">later the false flag boston bombing</text>
  <text start="56.03" dur="6.66">happened and there is there was a bomb</text>
  <text start="59.61" dur="7.38">drill going on during that period and</text>
  <text start="62.69" dur="7.66">right now what we see today is that gold</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="5.58">was slammed down around what is it like</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="6.18">fifty dollars or so forty-nine fifty</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="7.35">dollars or so and it&amp;#39;s been pushed down</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="7.26">and there is a drill coming up two days</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="7.77">from now which is Friday and June twenty</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="10.08">eighth which is the cyberattack drill</text>
  <text start="87.69" dur="9.39">called a quantum dawn to and this is DHS</text>
  <text start="93.87" dur="6.45">is preparing this drill where it will</text>
  <text start="97.08" dur="8.97">include many many financial institutions</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="8.089">and companies and they will pretend that</text>
  <text start="106.05" dur="6.48">there is a cyberattack happening and</text>
  <text start="108.409" dur="9.671">this is a perfect setup for something to</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="8.449">happen something like having the banks</text>
  <text start="118.08" dur="6.6">shut down the computer systems</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="8.32">completely freeze up you can&amp;#39;t get here</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="7.4">bank nobody can withdraw money and there</text>
  <text start="129.299" dur="5.881">we have to remember the sis / bill is</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="7.48">pending in the Senate now during the</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="5.69">Boston bombing the gun at bill was being</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="4.25">voted on</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="7.759">and in the beginning of the Boston</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="9.48">bombing they were going and they were</text>
  <text start="148.629" dur="8.431">using the black powder in the bomb and I</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="7.41">believe they were trying to pin that on</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="8.08">gun owners at the time but what happened</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="6.209">was DHS killed the cell towers and made</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="3.2">it impossible for people to communicate</text>
  <text start="166.909" dur="4.89">with each other because they were afraid</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="6.64">another bomb would go off and they</text>
  <text start="171.799" dur="7.291">didn&amp;#39;t realize that even though you even</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="6.569">though you kill the cell towers people</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="4.709">can still take pictures and what</text>
  <text start="181.549" dur="5.461">happened was when the cell towers came</text>
  <text start="183.799" dur="6.06">back online all these pictures started</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="5.97">to circulate all over the internet and a</text>
  <text start="189.859" dur="5.94">lot of questions were coming up and</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="4.89">things weren&amp;#39;t making sense and then all</text>
  <text start="195.799" dur="6.451">of a sudden we had a distraction down in</text>
  <text start="197.87" dur="7.799">Texas and for one whole day all eyes</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="5.609">were on Texas not on the Boston bombing</text>
  <text start="205.669" dur="4.741">anymore and then after that day passed</text>
  <text start="207.859" dur="4.651">we went back to the Boston bombing they</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="5.22">asked everyone to turn in their phones</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="5.19">and their pictures and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="6.74">see what they had and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="217.7" dur="4.67">they came up with the suspects and</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="10.659">basically the gun bill was in the Senate</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="6.81">and it was shot down so instead of</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="4.741">removing it President Obama asked them</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="5.731">to keep it in the Senate in a pending</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="6.209">state so right now we also have sista</text>
  <text start="242" dur="3.93">pending in the Senate it&amp;#39;s funny how all</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="5.911">these things just sit there in the</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="8.459">Senate and now since we have this</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="6.359">quantum dawn to cyber attack drill</text>
  <text start="254.389" dur="5.011">coming up June twenty eighth gold has</text>
  <text start="256.789" dur="6.901">been slammed down the stock market has</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="7.68">been pushed up almost to 15,000 points</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="6.029">and we see things oo lies back on the</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="4.44">stock market don&amp;#39;t invest in gold keep</text>
  <text start="269.719" dur="3.57">pushing that down</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="3.989">this is the same thing that happened</text>
  <text start="273.289" dur="4.47">right before the Boston bombing three</text>
  <text start="275.509" dur="6.351">days before here we have two days so</text>
  <text start="277.759" dur="6.87">what can we expect we can expect</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="6.79">probably something to happen now hey it</text>
  <text start="284.629" dur="7.771">might not happen but all signs seem to</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="6.75">point to something might happen will it</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="6.18">be the main cyber attack now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="8.489">think so will affect will it affect</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="8.579">people will it will it might shut down</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="5.851">some banks or make it impossible for</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="5.091">people to withdraw money I find it very</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="5.54">odd that they&amp;#39;re doing this on a friday</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="5.65">starting at nine o&amp;#39;clock going to 230</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="7.169">which allows the banks to be closed all</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="6.84">weekend if something goes wrong and</text>
  <text start="322.449" dur="6.37">we&amp;#39;re just going to have to stay on top</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="6.329">of this and and keep a watch on this but</text>
  <text start="328.819" dur="4.35">this is something where it just seems</text>
  <text start="331.069" dur="3.72">like there are too many things happening</text>
  <text start="333.169" dur="4.62">all at once and it seems like something</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="4.891">is definitely going to happen and I mean</text>
  <text start="337.789" dur="3.87">the other things they can do is if this</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="4.289">cyber attack does turn into a false flag</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="5.611">it gives them the perfect opportunity to</text>
  <text start="343.969" dur="5.82">pass the spa to use the internet kill</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="4.769">switch to stop information because</text>
  <text start="349.789" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ll say we have to shut it off to</text>
  <text start="352.039" dur="5.551">stop the cyber attacks and so on and so</text>
  <text start="355.159" dur="4.62">forth and you have to remember back you</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="6.689">know the Boston bombing we had the drill</text>
  <text start="359.779" dur="7.771">there during the Sandy Hook shooting we</text>
  <text start="364.279" dur="6.871">had a drill going on at the same time</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="6.179">during 911 we had a FEMA drill going on</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="5.34">so every time we hear a drill going on</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="5.851">it always seems like these false flag</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="5.07">events happen at the same exact time and</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="10.23">this is why I&amp;#39;m saying this at this</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="14.06">point okay now let&amp;#39;s move on here there</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="5.81">was an article with the the European</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="9.62">banking system is plan</text>
  <text start="401.88" dur="7.71">a haircut lower than a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="6.48">euro limit and basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="4.68">saying is the major issue is to rescue</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="5.22">the banks in case of the bankers</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="6.39">bankruptcy and like all show the haircut</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="6.03">of deposit even below a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="420.66" dur="5.85">euros assumed according to this plan</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="3.99">that they&amp;#39;ve drawn up the EU money to</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="3.09">cover bank failure will come from</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="4.83">deposits of large companies and</text>
  <text start="429.6" dur="4.89">bondholders followed by deposits over a</text>
  <text start="432.66" dur="3.9">hundred thousand belonged belonging to</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="5.73">individuals and to businesses with fewer</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="6.03">than 250 employees and revenues under 50</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="6.87">million and we know we always know what</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="7.68">happens after that it never stops there</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="6.45">it will continue on to the everyday</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="5.37">person because they&amp;#39;ll always this</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="4.32">always happens they always say they</text>
  <text start="455.64" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t have enough and we need to take</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="3.75">more and it continually happens and you</text>
  <text start="460.29" dur="3.72">have to remember back in Cyprus right</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="5.22">now they are still under capital</text>
  <text start="464.01" dur="7.08">controls their money is still frozen</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="7.11">they can&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t have access to all</text>
  <text start="471.09" dur="4.95">of their money that they already took</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="4.62">the haircut a lot of it&amp;#39;s been changed</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="6.06">in for worthless bank stock and the</text>
  <text start="478.56" dur="6.06">other portion of it is frozen so they</text>
  <text start="482.1" dur="5.07">had nothing has changed there but</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="5.1">everyone has forgotten about it if this</text>
  <text start="487.17" dur="4.92">happens in the European nations and they</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="3.84">stay under capital controls basically</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="5.34">everyone&amp;#39;s running around with no money</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="6.51">and all your money is pretty much gone</text>
  <text start="497.43" dur="4.83">and in Cyprus there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="5.25">sleeping on the streets who can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="6.9">it because this was their life savings</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="5.79">and think about it if you had twenty</text>
  <text start="509.16" dur="4.05">thousand ten thousand and it was</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="3.809">completely frozen and you were only</text>
  <text start="513.21" dur="7.8">allowed to take out a small portion</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="9">every day how would you survive and this</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="11.32">happened back in March and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="13.971">almost july so think about that now</text>
  <text start="532.33" dur="8.02">Italy is basically saying that it denies</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="8.19">that it could lose up to ten for ten</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="7.95">point four billion euros and basically</text>
  <text start="546.08" dur="4.17">this article goes on to say the Italian</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="4.89">Treasury has denied reports in the</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="5.01">Financial Times that ill Italy risk</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="4.38">losing ten point four billion on</text>
  <text start="555.26" dur="5.1">derivatives contracts and called the</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="4.44">suggestion absolutely baseless and I</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="4.77">hate to say this but every time a</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="5.88">government comes out or a government</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="5.76">official or a central banker or a Fed</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="5.67">comes out and says this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s always the opposite that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="573.56" dur="8.46">happen I mean we can use examples in the</text>
  <text start="577.04" dur="10.02">United States back in 1929 the president</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="7.8">came out and said in 1930 that the the</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="6.9">worst is behind us and everything should</text>
  <text start="589.82" dur="8.15">start improving and in 1932 the large</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="9.18">part of the crash happened the Fed in</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="8.74">2006-2007 and even in 2008 the Fed Ben</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="7.05">Bernanke said the Federal Reserve does</text>
  <text start="606.71" dur="6.51">not forecast a recession in the near</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="6.36">future and that he said this in 2008 the</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="5.1">subprime problem has been contained he</text>
  <text start="616.55" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t see unemployment going any</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="6.36">higher and they said all this stuff back</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="6.87">then today they&amp;#39;re saying the same thing</text>
  <text start="624.68" dur="7.26">and i believe the french president also</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="5.79">said not to worry now italy&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="631.94" dur="4.769">telling you not to worry and this always</text>
  <text start="634.22" dur="4.71">leads me to believe there is something</text>
  <text start="636.709" dur="5.071">to worry about any time they tell you</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="6.779">don&amp;#39;t worry or trust me it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="641.78" dur="9.059">opposite all right let&amp;#39;s move on here</text>
  <text start="645.709" dur="7.681">and oh and a an anonymous government</text>
  <text start="650.839" dur="5.19">official came out and said we made many</text>
  <text start="653.39" dur="4.92">mistakes were made during the 90s to get</text>
  <text start="656.029" dur="5.461">Italy into the euro and today those are</text>
  <text start="658.31" dur="6.39">turning into more debt hidden in the</text>
  <text start="661.49" dur="3.99">official accounts so something is going</text>
  <text start="664.7" dur="3.6">on there</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="5.219">and believe me in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="4.68">weeks you&amp;#39;ll hear that they have lost</text>
  <text start="670.699" dur="4.861">probably about double of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="5.52">reporting because again whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="5.1">saying whatever they&amp;#39;re telling you</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="4.079">don&amp;#39;t worry about it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="680.66" dur="6.169">opposite and it&amp;#39;s probably a lot more</text>
  <text start="682.579" dur="4.25">than smitten than what&amp;#39;s being reported</text>
  <text start="687.01" dur="7.09">now another article come out saying the</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="4.909">next major crash is here gold is the</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="6.33">major indicator and I&amp;#39;ve said this to</text>
  <text start="696.699" dur="5.44">just something is strange happening and</text>
  <text start="700.43" dur="5.48">everything that I look at and everything</text>
  <text start="702.139" dur="8.221">that I see something just doesn&amp;#39;t add up</text>
  <text start="705.91" dur="6.76">major players about to fall cities can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="4.95">sell their muni bonds the world assembly</text>
  <text start="712.67" dur="5.49">on the brink of severe cash crunch more</text>
  <text start="715.31" dur="5.639">money printing on the way and basically</text>
  <text start="718.16" dur="8.94">people are getting out of the market</text>
  <text start="720.949" dur="8.791">they&amp;#39;re trying to the sellers are</text>
  <text start="727.1" dur="5.31">everywhere trying to raise cash they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="729.74" dur="4.11">basically liquidating the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="4.44">came to the conclusion that no matter</text>
  <text start="733.85" dur="7.62">how much money they printed to in rien</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="7.169">fait it is it&amp;#39;s impossible to make</text>
  <text start="741.47" dur="4.559">things better they would create such</text>
  <text start="744.019" dur="4.62">large bubble that it would end in a</text>
  <text start="746.029" dur="6.42">total destruction it&amp;#39;s a no-win scenario</text>
  <text start="748.639" dur="5.82">and it doesn&amp;#39;t work and the public</text>
  <text start="752.449" dur="5">opinion on all this is very negative and</text>
  <text start="754.459" dur="5.731">there&amp;#39;s a lot of fear out there and</text>
  <text start="757.449" dur="5.471">basic basically people are getting their</text>
  <text start="760.19" dur="6.389">money out trying to cash out before this</text>
  <text start="762.92" dur="5.669">market pretty much goes down and we saw</text>
  <text start="766.579" dur="4.2">this in a couple episodes back where</text>
  <text start="768.589" dur="5.401">billionaires are starting to leave and</text>
  <text start="770.779" dur="6.601">cash out hedge funds are trying to sell</text>
  <text start="773.99" dur="5.61">their real estate investment companies</text>
  <text start="777.38" dur="4.709">who bought the real estate trying to</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="5.479">pump up the bubble are getting out also</text>
  <text start="782.089" dur="6.451">when you see major people getting out</text>

  <text start="1808.96" dur="5.76">that category and there are other things</text>
  <text start="1812.38" dur="5.37">when we saw more military training like</text>
  <text start="1814.72" dur="6.87">we saw in Miami LA with live round</text>

  <text start="1831.64" dur="4.2">a whole list of these things but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1833.29" dur="5.31">go back to this under the immigration</text>
  <text start="1835.84" dur="5.28">legislation and it&amp;#39;s making its way</text>
  <text start="1838.6" dur="4.23">through Congress right now there exists</text>
  <text start="1841.12" dur="3.57">a provision that will allow illegal</text>
  <text start="1842.83" dur="4.46">immigrants resigning the United States</text>

  <text start="1851.47" dur="4.7">means they can work legally within the</text>
  <text start="1853.27" dur="6.72">United States and it sounds great right</text>
  <text start="1856.17" dur="6.76">you know but this is the problem under</text>
  <text start="1859.99" dur="4.89">Obamacare businesses with over 50</text>

  <text start="1868.12" dur="3.81">subject to find up to 3,000 per worker</text>
  <text start="1870.19" dur="3.78">so what a business is going to do</text>
  <text start="1871.93" dur="4.49">they&amp;#39;re not going to hire American</text>
  <text start="1873.97" dur="5.7">people they&amp;#39;re going to keep it under 50</text>
  <text start="1876.42" dur="7.71">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be fined but</text>
  <text start="1879.67" dur="9.99">what they can do because of the newly</text>
  <text start="1884.13" dur="9.37">legalized immigrant laws they would be</text>
  <text start="1889.66" dur="8.54">eligible to work but not penalized under</text>
  <text start="1893.5" dur="11.94">the registered provisional immigrant and</text>
  <text start="1898.2" dur="9.1">basically so businesses can hire these</text>
  <text start="1905.44" dur="5.73">immigrants and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1907.3" dur="6.3">setting it up so these people are hired</text>
  <text start="1911.17" dur="5.64">and the Americans are not who have been</text>
  <text start="1913.6" dur="7.01">living here and they can hire all these</text>
  <text start="1916.81" dur="6.36">immigrant workers pay them less money</text>
  <text start="1920.61" dur="4.93">don&amp;#39;t have to supply them health</text>

  <text start="1932.61" dur="5.29">that is where we&amp;#39;re having the problem</text>
  <text start="1935.86" dur="6.99">here and again these laws were put into</text>
  <text start="1937.9" dur="6.6">place to penalize and do tax and this is</text>
  <text start="1942.85" dur="4.98">what this is what&amp;#39;s happening as you</text>
  <text start="1944.5" dur="5.22">notice more and more taxing is coming</text>
  <text start="1947.83" dur="3.75">about this is what happened in the</text>
  <text start="1949.72" dur="4.44">revolution this wasn&amp;#39;t the cause of the</text>
  <text start="1951.58" dur="5.52">revolution but this was part of the</text>
  <text start="1954.16" dur="6.39">revolution where the king was starting</text>
  <text start="1957.1" dur="5.67">to tax and place more and more laws on</text>

  <text start="1962.77" dur="9.42">to live free let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="1969.24" dur="5.68">cyberattacks energy companies at risk</text>
  <text start="1972.19" dur="4.8">there was an article out saying that the</text>

  <text start="1987.04" dur="6.48">Wednesday and basically this is just</text>
  <text start="1990.88" dur="4.5">leading up to a cyberattack letting</text>
  <text start="1993.52" dur="4.59">everyone know and they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="1995.38" dur="4.95">case against cyber attacks but what I</text>
  <text start="1998.11" dur="4.86">found very interesting</text>
  <text start="2000.33" dur="6.74">is that a DHS report points to</text>
  <text start="2002.97" dur="7.199">Armageddon scenario and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="2007.07" dur="8.26">this report saying that you know if like</text>
  <text start="2010.169" dur="8.36">some type of EMP or some type of direct</text>
  <text start="2015.33" dur="6.42">hit from a flare or something like that</text>
  <text start="2018.529" dur="5.921">but what interests me in this report is</text>
  <text start="2021.75" dur="8.309">that it corresponds to a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2024.45" dur="9.03">and but they&amp;#39;re using a different form</text>
  <text start="2030.059" dur="7.411">of attack which i think is bogus but it</text>
  <text start="2033.48" dur="7.26">goes on to say that more than 300 eh v</text>
  <text start="2037.47" dur="4.589">transformers destroyed this is in the</text>
  <text start="2040.74" dur="4.289">document i have a link to this document</text>
  <text start="2042.059" dur="6.12">by the way i&amp;#39;m sorry it&amp;#39;s section 4.3 of</text>
  <text start="2045.029" dur="5.251">the document and it and it goes on to</text>
  <text start="2048.179" dur="5.041">say that a hundred and thirty million</text>

  <text start="2068.129" dur="5.97">County Minnesota and this is what this</text>
  <text start="2071.429" dur="4.591">part of the report says but again if we</text>
  <text start="2074.099" dur="4.02">go back to two thousand three I believe</text>
  <text start="2076.02" dur="3.96">they were doing a test on the power grid</text>
  <text start="2078.119" dur="3.54">in the North East to see if they could</text>
  <text start="2079.98" dur="6.54">bring it down which they were successful</text>
  <text start="2081.659" dur="7.26">in doing and now this report is coming</text>
  <text start="2086.52" dur="4.889">out it is unclassified so everybody can</text>
  <text start="2088.919" dur="4.47">read it but most of the people that read</text>
  <text start="2091.409" dur="5.101">it see it you know it&amp;#39;s based on I</text>
  <text start="2093.389" dur="6.45">honest furyk electrojet or Sun flares or</text>
  <text start="2096.51" dur="7.109">EMP so people kind of dismiss it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2099.839" dur="6.481">looking at this as this was the study to</text>
