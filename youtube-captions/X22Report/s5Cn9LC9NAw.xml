  <text start="107.66" dur="5.34">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="110.14" dur="5.44">now it looks like the deep state they</text>
  <text start="113" dur="5.369">pushed their agenda forward and we knew</text>
  <text start="115.58" dur="5.16">they were going to do something during</text>
  <text start="118.369" dur="5.431">the Trump Putin summit that was</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.82">happening today and we see hole they had</text>
  <text start="123.8" dur="4.349">was they came out with indictments we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.56" dur="3.96">going to be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="5.251">moment but I wanted to start off with</text>
  <text start="130.52" dur="5.42">Lisa page here where she wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="6.12">testify behind closed doors and</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="7.09">basically what happened here is she did</text>
  <text start="139.52" dur="4.76">testify behind closed doors and it seems</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="3.3">that she was very cooperative</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="4.48">informative and answered many more</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="5.04">questions than struck she&amp;#39;s been willing</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="4.08">to help in the spirit of transparency we</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="4.38">certainly learned additional things</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="6.3">today said Meadows who was questioning</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="5.43">Page and in the private testimony she</text>
  <text start="159.14" dur="3.929">prior she primarily answered questions</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="4.98">about text messages would struck that</text>
  <text start="163.069" dur="6.361">allegedly showed biased against Trump</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="8.52">which is very interesting now from all</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="7.529">of this it might be that Lisa page she</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="5.13">might have flipped and she might be</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.981">assisting the investigation at this</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="4.92">point because as we know it&amp;#39;s trucks</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="5.26">testimony he left a lot of things out</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="5.77">didn&amp;#39;t want to reveal certain things</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="6.48">and really he was being coached the</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="6.69">whole time and once again to really</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="7.2">question someone you need to have all</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="6.66">the information and there was no</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="5.04">information because the real report not</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="5.37">the rewritten report by Rosenstein that</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="5.94">was redacted classified and given to</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.43">certain individuals where it said</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="4.8">nothing the real report is with Trump</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.71">and the gang of eight really read it I</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="4.92">mean they know what it says but again</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s not given out to the rest so they</text>
  <text start="221.58" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t know what is really in it and to</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="6.08">question someone it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="7.53">difficult so let&amp;#39;s move on to these</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="6.16">twelve Russian indictments god this</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="6.72">reminds me of when Muller came out and</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="6.569">indicted Russians and also indicted a</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="5.39">Russian company and the Russian company</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="5.041">decided to show up and Muller is</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="5.08">struggling with that because there was</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="6.15">really no evidence now this was thrown</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="5.31">out at the perfect time because we know</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="4.319">there was a summit going on between</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="4.53">Putin and Trump they didn&amp;#39;t want them to</text>
  <text start="258.329" dur="6.511">speak they wanted to cover up the entire</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="6.63">story so rod Rosenstein came out with</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="4.68">the 12 Russian military intelligence</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="5.31">officers for allegedly hacking Hillary</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="6.72">emails and interfering in the US</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="7.71">election and they threw a monkey wrench</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="6.87">in the summit with Putin Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="5.43">where did they because if you read the</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="5.13">indictment you will see that it consists</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="5.13">of nothing but improbable accusations</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s no way on earth that the US</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="3.329">Justice Department would be able to</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="3.87">acquire the information in this</text>
  <text start="293.789" dur="5.101">fictional story that Rosenstein has</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.47">presented moreover there is no sign</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="3.81">whatsoever of any evidence in the</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="4.05">indictment of course the rezident</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="3.93">because they knew</text>
  <text start="304.95" dur="4.41">that these Russians and this why they</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="4.8">include a Russian company this time they</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.82">knew that these Russians weren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="6.36">to come over here and stand up to the</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="6.12">charges they&amp;#39;re betting on that because</text>
  <text start="317.79" dur="6.63">they need to use propaganda</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="5.34">so Rosenstein his throne red meat into</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="6.84">the mainstream media who are assets of</text>
  <text start="326.64" dur="8.55">the deep state and mainstream media will</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="7.98">pressure anyone they possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="335.19" dur="5.97">behind Rosenstein to say yes there was</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.62">Russian interference</text>
  <text start="341.16" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to try to use this again</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s no evidence just because you</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="3.72">have an indictment it means absolutely</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="5.22">nothing you can then pretty much indict</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="5.07">anyone but you need to have evidence to</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="6.69">back it up for the trial and everything</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="7.23">else so the first charge is for</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.16">conspiracy to commit an offense against</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="4.77">the United States by stealing emails and</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="5.64">leaking him the indictment claims that</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.22">the GRU units sent spear phishing emails</text>
  <text start="369.51" dur="5.28">to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="4.98">Democratic Party organization DN C and</text>
  <text start="374.79" dur="4.8">the D see see see</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="5.31">they use these to get access to email</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="4.62">boxes on John Podesta and other people</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="6.87">they also accused of installing spyware</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="7.52">X agent on DNC computers of the X fill</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="5.25">trading emails and other data from them</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="4.93">the emails were distributed and</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="5.67">published by the online persons DC leaks</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="5.43">lucifer ii and later through WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="6.27">the indictment claims that DC leaks and</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="7.53">gusoff ur the second were impersonations</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="5.82">by the GRU WikiLeaks organization one in</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="5.88">the indictment is implicated but so far</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="5.76">it not accused charged two to nine of</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="4.32">the indictment are about aggravated</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="4.44">identity theft for using usernames and</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="5.61">passwords for personal email accounts of</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="6.48">others charge ten is about conspiracy to</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="5.31">launder money this was allegedly done</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="4.62">through a web of transactions structured</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="4.709">to capitalize on the perceived</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="5.459">anonymity of crypto currencies such as</text>
  <text start="435.449" dur="5.25">Bitcoin it is alleged that the accused</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="4.951">mined bitcoins Channel these through</text>
  <text start="440.699" dur="4.981">dozens of accounts and transactions and</text>
  <text start="443.43" dur="4.65">then use them to rent servers virtually</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="5.549">private network access and domain names</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="4.98">used in the operation charge 11 on the</text>
  <text start="451.229" dur="3.991">indictment is a conspiracy to commit an</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="4.02">offense against the United States it</text>
  <text start="455.22" dur="3.99">claims that some of the accused hacked</text>
  <text start="457.08" dur="3.959">into state boards of election and into</text>
  <text start="459.21" dur="4.049">US companies providing elections related</text>
  <text start="461.039" dur="5.91">software the indictment describes a wide</text>
  <text start="463.259" dur="7.19">range operation but includes zero proof</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="6.21">of anything it led it alleges Mueller</text>
  <text start="470.449" dur="4.69">hopes that the indictment will never</text>
  <text start="473.159" dur="3.991">come in front of court this is of course</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="4.731">what they hope because this is why they</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="4.98">indicted the Russians that are not here</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="4.449">the alleged stuff would be extremely</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="4.98">difficult to prove any decent lawyer</text>
  <text start="484.319" dur="4.65">would ask how the claimed information</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="3.83">was gained and how much of it was based</text>
  <text start="488.969" dur="5.311">on the illegal snooping by the NSA</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="6.779">something the US would have to reveal it</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="6.479">is unlikely there will be a trial or</text>
  <text start="497.719" dur="4.991">maybe there will be because when he</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="3.96">indicted the Russian company and the</text>
  <text start="502.71" dur="5.489">other Russians he didn&amp;#39;t expect anyone</text>
  <text start="504.719" dur="5.13">to come here and challenge this so maybe</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="3.27">these individuals maybe this would be</text>
  <text start="509.849" dur="4.701">the best thing for these individuals to</text>
  <text start="511.469" dur="6.51">come to the US and challenge all of this</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="5.89">now as we take a closer look at all of</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.98">this we see something that&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="4.8">shocking and it&amp;#39;s in this paragraph and</text>
  <text start="522.959" dur="3.75">mueller&amp;#39;s indictment which mirrors the</text>
  <text start="525.24" dur="4.07">wording from a case against Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.709" dur="4.861">former campaign manager John Podesta an</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.17">occasion in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="4.29">Swigert versus Podesta which shows a</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="4.2">number of defendants represented by the</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="7.169">Democrat favorite law firm perkins coie</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.3">LLP there was wording very similar to</text>
  <text start="543.029" dur="4.351">the wording in friday&amp;#39;s Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="2.94">indictment in paragraph 44 of the</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="3.24">complaint</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="5.46">Swigert notes that DNC had created a</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="4.8">phishing scheme to divert donations away</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="4.079">from the Bernie Sanders campaign to a</text>
  <text start="555.42" dur="3.57">different account controlled by debbie</text>
  <text start="557.459" dur="5.221">Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="6.9">and or Imran a1 the account was labeled</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="7.05">act blue calm which was changed to act</text>
  <text start="565.89" dur="5.46">blues calm in Friday&amp;#39;s indictment</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="4.68">against the Russians the Mueller team</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="5.87">states basically the same thing so much</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="6.21">so that Friday&amp;#39;s indictment looks</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="5.88">plagiarized Mueller&amp;#39;s gang states that</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="5.79">the Russians did the same thing in</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="6.82">changing the Act blue dot-com account to</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="5.549">act Blues dot-com so we are supposed to</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="3.419">believe that the Russians lacking money</text>
  <text start="591.959" dur="3.781">were trying to steal from the DNC to</text>
  <text start="593.339" dur="4.951">fund one of their many national</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="5.36">initiatives this doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="598.29" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s as if the Mueller team copied a</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="5.89">paragraph from another case inserted it</text>
  <text start="603.69" dur="4.91">into Friday&amp;#39;s fake indictment and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="5.46">pretty much what really happened here</text>
  <text start="608.6" dur="6.429">now Rosenstein has confirmed that the</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="4.59">DNC server was not hacked emails were</text>
  <text start="615.029" dur="4.651">obtained through spearfishing</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="7.529">which we just mentioned</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="6.689">so when was the DNC server hacked well</text>
  <text start="624.569" dur="5.041">we know the FBI never looked into it</text>
  <text start="626.369" dur="4.91">we know that Clinton hired their own</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="5.49">team CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="631.279" dur="6.131">they looked into it and right now we</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="5.969">have no evidence now what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="637.41" dur="5.969">about this is that cue pretty much told</text>
  <text start="641.069" dur="6.3">us what was going to happen and we know</text>
  <text start="643.379" dur="7.2">from cue that the Patriots have the</text>
  <text start="647.369" dur="7.26">server we have the server we have the</text>
  <text start="650.579" dur="9.24">emails we have Assange we have all that</text>
  <text start="654.629" dur="8.43">information so Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="659.819" dur="5.13">issued his first public comment about</text>
  <text start="663.059" dur="4.95">the indictment of the 12 Russian</text>
  <text start="664.949" dur="5.64">military officers and what he said was</text>
  <text start="668.009" dur="4.531">the following the stories you heard</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="4.321">about the 12 Russians yesterday took</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="4.889">place during the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="674.91" dur="4.32">not the Trump administration why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="677.429" dur="3.241">they do something about it especially</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="3.63">when I was reported that President Obama</text>
  <text start="680.67" dur="5.219">was informed by the FBI in September</text>
  <text start="682.86" dur="6.089">before the elections now remember Q has</text>
  <text start="685.889" dur="4.831">told us that they have the server they</text>
  <text start="688.949" dur="4.38">have the server they have the emails</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="3.39">they know where Assange is they have his</text>
  <text start="693.329" dur="3.6">information</text>
  <text start="694.11" dur="6.93">so then Trump tweeted the next thing out</text>
  <text start="696.929" dur="6.96">where is the DNC server and why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="6.389">the FBI take possession of it deep state</text>

  <text start="773.759" dur="6.3">we may have to force this one so the</text>

  <text start="780.059" dur="4.44">Journal</text>
  <text start="781.429" dur="6.611">why doesn&amp;#39;t Trump declassify this to</text>

  <text start="832.89" dur="7.47">looks like the plan is on schedule now</text>
  <text start="837.27" dur="3.45">we know that Trump has been meeting with</text>
  <text start="840.36" dur="3.15">Putin</text>
  <text start="840.72" dur="5.1">we know that Trump has come out and said</text>

  <text start="866.55" dur="4.26">out they&amp;#39;re meaningless remember they</text>

  <text start="978.67" dur="6.27">have evidence of this that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="981.55" dur="6.69">using Afghanistan the poppy fields to</text>
  <text start="984.94" dur="6.48">create opium to distribute the drugs and</text>

  <text start="994" dur="5.19">out on it and we see they also recalled</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="4.139">out back in Syria for remember back in</text>
  <text start="999.19" dur="4.53">time when Russia started to get involved</text>
  <text start="1001.589" dur="5.071">in Obama was president and Russia found</text>
  <text start="1003.72" dur="5.52">the mysterious oil convoy and they</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="3.99">destroyed the oil convoy where the US</text>
  <text start="1009.24" dur="2.849">couldn&amp;#39;t find it they didn&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="1010.65" dur="3.21">was I mean which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1012.089" dur="4.081">ridiculous and we know back then Obama</text>
  <text start="1013.86" dur="3.87">was calling about the different targets</text>
  <text start="1016.17" dur="3.78">and he was never going to call out the</text>
  <text start="1017.73" dur="4.77">oil convoy because that was paying for</text>
  <text start="1019.95" dur="5.999">the Islamic state the same things</text>
  <text start="1022.5" dur="6.15">happening here Russia is calling out the</text>
  <text start="1025.949" dur="4.13">u.s. the deep state saying that we know</text>
  <text start="1028.65" dur="4.289">what you&amp;#39;ve been doing in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1030.079" dur="3.931">you&amp;#39;ve allowed the poppy fields to</text>
  <text start="1032.939" dur="2.991">flourish</text>
  <text start="1034.01" dur="3.56">you&amp;#39;ve been using this to pay for the</text>
  <text start="1035.93" dur="4.32">irk covert operation</text>
  <text start="1037.57" dur="6.28">Trump is out there once again saying</text>
  <text start="1040.25" dur="6.05">that Iran is going to call him and seek</text>
  <text start="1043.85" dur="5.27">a fresh deal</text>
  <text start="1046.3" dur="6.36">and this call is going to be coming very</text>
  <text start="1049.12" dur="5.91">very soon we see the corporate media we</text>
  <text start="1052.66" dur="5.37">see the coalition they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="1055.03" dur="5.55">saying that Trump needs to help the</text>
  <text start="1058.03" dur="4.56">white helmets get out of Syria right now</text>
  <text start="1060.58" dur="4.08">now we know the white helmets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1062.59" dur="6.87">really the terrorist groups they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1064.66" dur="7.62">put in there to create these false flags</text>
  <text start="1069.46" dur="4.35">to create the events to film them and to</text>
  <text start="1072.28" dur="4.14">make everyone believe that these are</text>
  <text start="1073.81" dur="4.86">real and we know that they are not and</text>
  <text start="1076.42" dur="3.63">we see right now that the white helmets</text>
  <text start="1078.67" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck right now and</text>
  <text start="1080.05" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re looking for a way to get the</text>
  <text start="1082.09" dur="7.2">white helmets out of Syria and we see</text>
  <text start="1084.37" dur="7.23">there&amp;#39;s a huge evacuation event going on</text>
  <text start="1089.29" dur="4.14">in Syria right now where the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1091.6" dur="2.97">are trying to leave the white helmets</text>
  <text start="1093.43" dur="3.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to get them out of there</text>
  <text start="1094.57" dur="6.75">because what&amp;#39;s happening is the entire</text>
  <text start="1096.9" dur="7.33">war is coming to an end and the winner</text>
  <text start="1101.32" dur="5.46">is Assad and Russia the loser is the</text>
  <text start="1104.23" dur="4.32">coalition forces the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="1106.78" dur="4.35">terrorist groups and they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="1108.55" dur="4.8">right now we see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1111.13" dur="6.3">democratic forces they had handed over</text>
  <text start="1113.35" dur="6.66">el amor oil fields to Damascus under a</text>
  <text start="1117.43" dur="4.38">secret deal and we could see that</text>
  <text start="1120.01" dur="3.93">everything is coming back to Syria</text>
  <text start="1121.81" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re giving up the oil fields they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1123.94" dur="6.75">giving up their weapons they are now on</text>
  <text start="1126.22" dur="6.84">the out we see why Bolton has been put</text>
  <text start="1130.69" dur="5.79">into the position that he is in because</text>
  <text start="1133.06" dur="5.43">we know that he&amp;#39;s a neocon we know that</text>
  <text start="1136.48" dur="4.68">when he says something and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1138.49" dur="4.98">instructed to say something like we will</text>
  <text start="1141.16" dur="4.83">only pull out if Iran pulls out and of</text>
  <text start="1143.47" dur="6.27">course he uses other words this was done</text>
  <text start="1145.99" dur="6.2">on purpose this is part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="1149.74" dur="6.71">put it out there to let everyone know if</text>
  <text start="1152.19" dur="8.08">Iran leaves the u.s. will leave Syria</text>
  <text start="1156.45" dur="6.43">this is the plan Iran is the cover and</text>
  <text start="1160.27" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re using this to get out and I said</text>
  <text start="1162.88" dur="6.21">once Trump and Putin meet this plan is</text>
  <text start="1166.39" dur="5.22">going to move forward so the amount the</text>
  <text start="1169.09" dur="4.65">American message is clear the US will</text>
  <text start="1171.61" dur="4.14">leave al tamped crossing and a band in</text>

  <text start="1182.34" dur="4.559">withdrawal of all Iranian forces from</text>
  <text start="1184.529" dur="5.58">that area and guess what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1186.899" dur="5.91">happen even no Iran is saying well Assad</text>

  <text start="1207.929" dur="4.59">Iran here the terrorists have been</text>
