  <text start="107.22" dur="3.36">start off with what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="4.47">what the mainstream media want you to</text>
  <text start="110.58" dur="5.67">believe now the Federal Reserve said</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="5.369">that consumer credit which measures</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.77">outstanding non mortgage debt climbed</text>

  <text start="121.02" dur="5.01">one trillion dollars isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.98">fantastic and they went on to say that</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="4.47">this healthy uptick in credit levels can</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="4.051">reflect upbeat outlooks for the economy</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="3.989">and the consumer spending which accounts</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="4.92">for more than two-thirds of business</text>
  <text start="134.489" dur="5.181">activities well let&amp;#39;s think about this</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="7.77">for a second they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="7.179">dead jumped does debt help the economy</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="4.35">know it helps a central bank economy</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="5.041">does it help the people well no it</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="5.76">doesn&amp;#39;t help the people why think about</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="6.45">this for a second when the entire</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="6.03">central bank system declines which it</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.849">has been what happened the value of the</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="3.66">dollar declines that means you need a</text>
  <text start="164.189" dur="4.081">lot more doll</text>
  <text start="165" dur="5.22">to pay for the same exact thing if you</text>
  <text start="168.27" dur="4.23">need a lot more dollars your dollars</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t go as far it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the</text>
  <text start="172.5" dur="5.76">products that are produced costs more it</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="6.48">means that the dollar is losing value if</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="6.15">the dollar is losing value what do you</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="5.43">need to supplement all of this credit</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="6.81">you need to borrow because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="6.3">have enough to survive on think about</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.88">this for a second in today&amp;#39;s economy if</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="8.79">we stripped away all credit cards all</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="9.21">auto loans mortgages student loans do</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="6.6">you think most Americans can actually</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="7.35">survive today on the cash they are</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="7.08">receiving most likely not so when the</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="6.81">central bank tells us that everything is</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="7.41">fantastic because debt is rising that is</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="4.41">not the case now remember now because</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="4.82">the debt is rising and more people are</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="5.07">putting making their purchases on credit</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="6.46">what happened</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="8.28">well those individuals who can&amp;#39;t pay it</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="6.06">they become delinquent and it looks like</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="5.82">there are a lot of credit card balances</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="6.089">that had been barreling towards serious</text>
  <text start="244.05" dur="5.46">delinquency there is auto loans that are</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="5.431">90 days past due now it&amp;#39;s record numbers</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="5.16">and this is what happens but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="5.61">care about that part all they care about</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="7.83">is telling everyone that the economy is</text>
  <text start="258" dur="6.84">doing very very well because the debt is</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="5.1">rising think about when they talk about</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="5.79">the holiday season they talk about</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="6.12">purchases on how much people have used</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="4.44">their credit cards and there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="4.53">for this because we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="5.19">to think that debt is good but this is</text>
  <text start="278.25" dur="4.86">all about to change and like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="5.25">saying to change all this Trump and the</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="6.09">Patriots how to go in and trade and</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="6.36">change the trade deals and we see Trump</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="4.44">doing this he got rid of the globalist</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.98">trade deals he made new trade deals with</text>
  <text start="293.64" dur="4.74">Japan Europe South Korea Mexico China is</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="4.74">in the works right now and</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="6.09">now he&amp;#39;s hinting that India is next he</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="5.25">tweeted out the following India has long</text>
  <text start="304.47" dur="5.7">had a field day putting tariffs on</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="5.94">American products no longer acceptable</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="5.67">and it looks like he is headed down the</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="5.91">road and he is getting ready to change</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="5.73">up the trade deal now this has to be</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="5.85">done all these globalist trade deals</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="4.86">have to be reworked to put the United</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="4.16">States on an even playing field because</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="4.71">when everything starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="328.7" dur="4.21">the entire system and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="331.14" dur="5.04">the central bank system starts to</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="6.09">implode the new system which trumpet the</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="5.19">Patriots are setting up that will take</text>
  <text start="339" dur="5.34">over and for that to be a winning</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="6.54">economy to benefit the people we have to</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="5.55">redo or reset everything the globalists</text>
  <text start="347.91" dur="3.89">and the central banks have been doing</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="4.47">Trump also tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="4.66">very good numbers on the economy much</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="3.51">potential for growth trade deals being</text>
  <text start="356.46" dur="3.63">negotiated or being set up for</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="4.2">negotiation we&amp;#39;ve been treated very</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="4.35">unfairly to put it mildly by other</text>
  <text start="362.07" dur="5.97">countries for many years but it is</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="6.87">changing and it has to change this is</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="5.82">all being done on purpose because the</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="4.62">plan of draining the swamp that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="4.59">only that&amp;#39;s only part of the plan the</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="6.39">other part of the plan is to reset the</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="6.18">entire economic system and to remove the</text>
  <text start="382.32" dur="3.81">funding to the deep state and that is</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="2.04">the source which comes from the central</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="2.79">bank</text>
  <text start="386.67" dur="5.79">now queue has been telling us that gold</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="6.12">will destroy the Fed let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="4.68">at how Trump is positioning certain</text>
  <text start="395.04" dur="5.97">individuals into place to push this plan</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="7.59">now we know Judy Shelton she is being</text>
  <text start="401.01" dur="7.82">nominated by Trump she is a gold</text>
  <text start="404.73" dur="7.44">standard supporter she likes gold</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="5.68">Shelton praised gold while comparing it</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="4.86">to cryptocurrencies in 2018 a piece</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="4.56">published by the Cato Institute she said</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="3.9">if the appeal of cryptocurrencies is</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="4.35">their capacity to provide a common</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="4.74">currency and to maintain a uniform value</text>
  <text start="423.42" dur="4.35">for every issued unit we need only</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="4.92">consulted historical experience to</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="3.31">ascertain that these same qualities were</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="1.96">achieved</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="4.739">the classical international gold</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="5.579">standard she continued in proposing a</text>
  <text start="435.819" dur="4.261">new international monetary system linked</text>
  <text start="438.129" dur="4.26">in some way to gold America has an</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="5.269">opportunity to secure continued</text>
  <text start="442.389" dur="6.06">prominence in global monetary affairs</text>
  <text start="445.349" dur="5.621">Shelton has indicated that should be in</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="4.951">favor of a Bretton Woods style</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="5.4">conference and she was referring to the</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.53">1944 United Nations gathering after</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="6.539">World War two that set up the new system</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="5.32">remember a lot of Europe was decimated</text>
  <text start="462.909" dur="5.671">these countries gave the United States</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="6.719">their gold and gold was used to</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="6.389">stabilize the system and remember Europe</text>
  <text start="471.969" dur="6.45">was decimated because of World War two</text>
  <text start="474.969" dur="5.85">so the governments of Europe didn&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="478.419" dur="4.831">it was safe to keep gold there and the</text>
  <text start="480.819" dur="4.231">United States held it for them so let me</text>
  <text start="483.25" dur="4.44">continue with the Bretton Woods style</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="4.649">conference she said it would be with the</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="4.77">purpose of establishing a convertible</text>
  <text start="489.699" dur="6.87">gold back bond as a neutral reference</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="6.389">point for currency now Shelton also</text>
  <text start="496.569" dur="5.371">favors low interest rates Mike</text>
  <text start="498.849" dur="4.56">Trump very interesting huh she has also</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="3.33">criticized the practice of paying</text>
  <text start="503.409" dur="4.281">interest on excess reserves stored at</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="4.829">the Fed arguing that it incentivizes</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="4.539">banks to do nothing with money instead</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="4.591">of lending it out to phase out the</text>
  <text start="512.229" dur="5.461">practice Shelton would cut interest</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="5.31">rates and counter any result inflation</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.38">by selling the feds holdings of Treasury</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.19">securities Shelton blame the federal</text>
  <text start="522.07" dur="5.07">reserve for worsening the 2008 crisis no</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="3.45">other government institution had more</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="3.21">influence over the creation of money and</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="4.41">credit in the lead-up to the devastating</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="4.47">2008 global meltdown she wrote in The</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="3.539">Wall Street Journal op-ed and the feds</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="4.32">response to the meltdown may have</text>
  <text start="536.589" dur="4.081">exacerbated the damage by lowering the</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="3.689">incentive for banks to fund private</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="5.07">sector growth now if Shelton was</text>
  <text start="542.829" dur="5.07">confirmed by the Senate will her</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="4.469">appointment to the Fed bring a</text>
  <text start="547.899" dur="6.151">restructuring of the Fed and uh sure in</text>
  <text start="550.209" dur="6.151">the gold standard and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="4.74">this would be the case and so does cue</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="5.46">now what I&amp;#39;m going to do is I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="5.73">take one of the posts that Q has been</text>

  <text start="566.89" dur="5.16">into this report because it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="6.86">important remember back in post 2619</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="7.13">where anon said do we have the gold and</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="8.2">q said yes gold shall destroy the Fed</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="8.77">well q gave us this new post and gave us</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="6.72">a link to CBS news.com and it says</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="6.21">Trump&amp;#39;s Fed picked Judy Shelton gold</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="8.7">standard explained Judy Shelton wants</text>

  <text start="599.65" dur="12.21">q is letting everyone know that yes we</text>
  <text start="603.76" dur="11.39">are interacting to the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="611.86" dur="6.21">to have sound money</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="4.51">remember Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="618.07" dur="5.7">been planning this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="5.67">they are positioning all players and if</text>
  <text start="623.77" dur="3.57">Judy Shelton doesn&amp;#39;t work out guess what</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="3.9">they have someone else in mind but</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re hoping that Judy Shelton gets in</text>
  <text start="629.23" dur="3.18">there just like they had the other two</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="4.05">now sometimes what they do is they put</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="5.67">two people up knowing that they will not</text>
  <text start="634.72" dur="5.58">be acceptable and they remove them and</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="4.2">then put the person they really want and</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="4.62">I do believe Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="642.28" dur="5.94">really want Judy Shelton in there</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="8.13">because I do believe that she is the one</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="7.8">that is going to push this agenda and Q</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="4.71">is confirming that yes we are on track</text>
