  <text start="183.78" dur="4.53">type of relationship with the staffroom</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.4">and right now she&amp;#39;s facing a house</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="3.81">investigation over allegations of being</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.05">romantically involved with a</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="6.3">congressional staffer now she finally</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="5.97">had to admit all of this she admitted to</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="5.58">an inappropriate relationship with her</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="5.669">aide she said in a letter to her</text>

  <text start="228.959" dur="5.431">denied denied denied and then finally</text>

  <text start="234.39" dur="5.61">really believed her anyhow it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="7.349">like everyone else in Congress in</text>
  <text start="240" dur="6.75">government they lie until they can&amp;#39;t lie</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="5.611">anymore but if they feel that they can</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="5.299">get away with it they continue to lie</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="6.66">now the Biden&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="252.049" dur="6.551">we now have a woman who says Biden is</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="6.629">the father of her child and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>

  <text start="273.24" dur="6.51">Biden said his client admits and agrees</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="7.88">that a paternity test is warranted now</text>

  <text start="285.9" dur="4.47">procedures for administering the</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="4.53">paternity test and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.38">this all plays out but very interesting</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="4.23">Li Paul Sperry tweeted something about</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="3.6">all of this</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="5.31">that might be the undoing of hunter</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="5.37">Biden breaking details about hunter</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="4.8">Biden&amp;#39;s murky finances from windfall</text>

  <text start="313.5" dur="7.62">to file affidavit of financial means in</text>
  <text start="316.83" dur="8.49">support of love child now this would be</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="6.87">hilarious if they start to discover his</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="3.38">financial dealings and it comes out this</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="3.03">way</text>
  <text start="328.7" dur="5.98">remember when Rudy Giuliani mentioned</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="6.42">Romania well the scandal has now</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="4.76">expanded to Romania just like Rudy</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="4.8">Giuliani said now the Biden family</text>
  <text start="339.44" dur="6.16">scandal started out in Ukraine went to</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="7.8">China and now here we are in Romania so</text>
  <text start="345.6" dur="6.83">in 2016 hunter Biden traveled to Romania</text>
  <text start="350.04" dur="4.68">to meet with a shady real estate tycoon</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.08">who was accused of orchestrating a</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="5.64">corrupt land deal now the Romanian</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="4.62">businessman was Gabriel men even I try</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="3.72">to pronounce his last name he was a</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="5.49">wealthy real estate individual and</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="7.68">hunter Biden was brought in to be his</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="8.01">lawyer think about it hunter Biden the</text>
  <text start="371.76" dur="8.91">drug addict was going to defend this</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="6.06">individual very interesting now Gabriel</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="4.41">became the target of a criminal</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="5.82">investigation back in 2005 when another</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="4.89">businessman filed a complaint against</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="4.56">him and the rector of Romanian</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="5.46">university for the sale of plot of land</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="4.89">near Bucharest Gabriel had reportedly</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.72">purchased the land for significantly</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="6">less money than it was actually worth</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="5.13">now according to these documents it was</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="3.48">alleged that the plot of land was</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="4.64">actually owned by the Romanian</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="6.09">government not the University of</text>
  <text start="408.92" dur="6.73">agronomy now Gabriel was hit with</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="5.76">bribery charge and convicted in 2016</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="6.42">however he filed an appeal this is when</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="6.69">Joe Biden&amp;#39;s drug-addicted son Hunter was</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="5.61">brought in as legal counsel does this</text>
  <text start="424.98" dur="4.68">all make sense it is important to note</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="6.9">that from 2009 to</text>
  <text start="429.66" dur="7.11">20:16 Joe Biden was very involved in</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="4.5">Romania and had many connections to the</text>

  <text start="498" dur="4.26">then the whistleblowers kind of</text>
  <text start="500.34" dur="4.62">disappeared because Trump released his</text>

  <text start="1103.649" dur="4.561">in control right no they&amp;#39;re not this is</text>
  <text start="1106.83" dur="2.76">why they&amp;#39;re putting out these stories</text>

  <text start="1131.25" dur="5.01">have an idea of what they have because</text>
  <text start="1134.13" dur="4.5">remember they never thought she was</text>
  <text start="1136.26" dur="5.43">going to lose so did they cover anything</text>
