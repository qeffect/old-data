  <text start="88.57" dur="6.28">basically the US jobless rate hit a six</text>
  <text start="92.63" dur="5.22">week high and they had to go back and</text>

  <text start="130.399" dur="4.831">right now compared to what the</text>
  <text start="133.1" dur="3.68">government&amp;#39;s telling us is what is 7.5</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="3.41">or something like that</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="4.74">and then they go ahead and they revise</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="5.76">it and they it&amp;#39;s worse and it&amp;#39;s at the</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="5.58">highest level that we&amp;#39;ve seen since last</text>

  <text start="495.31" dur="6.54">the Muslims they don&amp;#39;t like our freedoms</text>
  <text start="497.919" dur="5.851">really people die mean let&amp;#39;s just think</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="4.23">about this this is the excuse that they</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="7.29">give they don&amp;#39;t like us because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="8.28">too free does that make any sense and I</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="7.02">and I always said if that is the case in</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="9.51">all these countries why do people come</text>
  <text start="518.08" dur="7.92">here to live here even from those</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="3.69">countries why do they come to go to</text>
  <text start="526" dur="3.93">school here and then return to their</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="4.529">countries it&amp;#39;s not because of our</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="8.009">freedoms it&amp;#39;s because of the central</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="10.17">bank there&amp;#39;s no other reason</text>
  <text start="537.939" dur="6.6">why all this is happening all right</text>
  <text start="542.259" dur="4.14">let&amp;#39;s move on now there was an</text>
  <text start="544.539" dur="3.96">interesting article about cell phone</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="5.49">users have no legitimate expectations of</text>
  <text start="548.499" dur="6.45">privacy so basically if you have your</text>
  <text start="551.889" dur="4.5">cell phone the Fourth Amendment really</text>
  <text start="554.949" dur="3.3">doesn&amp;#39;t cover that at all because a</text>
  <text start="556.389" dur="3.47">federal judge recently ruled that if</text>
  <text start="558.249" dur="4.23">someone has their cell phone turned on</text>
  <text start="559.859" dur="4.27">their location data does not deserve</text>
  <text start="562.479" dur="3.6">protection under the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="564.129" dur="4.95">meaning law enforcement can track</text>
  <text start="566.079" dur="7.76">individuals without a search warrant now</text>
  <text start="569.079" dur="4.76">the III kind of have a problem with this</text>
  <text start="575.279" dur="11.67">because you mean if your phone is on who</text>
  <text start="584.499" dur="6.27">is giving them the right to track you</text>
  <text start="586.949" dur="6.64">just I mean they have your let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.769" dur="5.79">use a simpler example they have your</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="4.71">address where you live just because they</text>
  <text start="596.559" dur="4.5">have the address where you live doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="598.299" dur="4.8">mean they can come into your home just</text>
  <text start="601.059" dur="6.03">because the phone you can get</text>
  <text start="603.099" dur="6.75">information from the phone from cell</text>
  <text start="607.089" dur="6.06">towers which can triangulate where you</text>
  <text start="609.849" dur="8.01">are or from GPS doesn&amp;#39;t mean they have</text>
  <text start="613.149" dur="7.56">the right to access that data and I</text>
  <text start="617.859" dur="8.67">don&amp;#39;t understand how they can say this</text>
  <text start="620.709" dur="8.22">because you know if you have I mean it</text>
  <text start="626.529" dur="5.67">makes no sense to me what what this</text>
  <text start="628.929" dur="7.08">judge is trying to say and you know if</text>
  <text start="632.199" dur="7.71">you have your phone turned on it makes</text>
  <text start="636.009" dur="7.2">no sense but again they&amp;#39;re just taking</text>
  <text start="639.909" dur="5.52">away our rights they they don&amp;#39;t want us</text>
  <text start="643.209" dur="5.58">to have this right they don&amp;#39;t want their</text>
  <text start="645.429" dur="5.61">I mean if you really look at it the fact</text>
  <text start="648.789" dur="4.53">is they&amp;#39;re trying to take away the</text>
  <text start="651.039" dur="5.22">Second Amendment they&amp;#39;re trying to take</text>
  <text start="653.319" dur="4.95">away your First Amendment with freedom</text>
  <text start="656.259" dur="5.94">of speech they&amp;#39;re trying to take away</text>
  <text start="658.269" dur="6.72">your fourth your fifth your six all</text>
  <text start="662.199" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re doing this through all the laws</text>
  <text start="664.989" dur="6.271">that they&amp;#39;re passing the patriot act the</text>
  <text start="667.869" dur="7.761">NDAA the exception rule for the</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="6.45">and ur right and you can see this</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="5.53">throughout everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="677.71" dur="5.25">and all the executive orders and the</text>
  <text start="681.16" dur="3.36">executive orders for the internet the</text>
  <text start="682.96" dur="4.89">executive orders for the gun control the</text>
  <text start="684.52" dur="6.45">executive orders for everything that</text>
  <text start="687.85" dur="4.68">there is that has to do with your rights</text>
  <text start="690.97" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="692.53" dur="4.98">plus we&amp;#39;ve had harvard law professors</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="6.2">michael bloomberg all these peoples</text>
  <text start="697.51" dur="6.96">telling us that maybe the Constitution</text>
  <text start="701.4" dur="5.2">does not need to be around here anymore</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="4.29">because it&amp;#39;s kind of old fashioned and</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not really standing up to the test</text>
  <text start="708.76" dur="5.85">of time which they&amp;#39;re completely wrong</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="8.16">if we go through each amendment each</text>
  <text start="714.61" dur="7.56">ripe one by one each one stands up to</text>
  <text start="719.11" dur="5.51">the test of time it&amp;#39;s them who do not</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="5.49">stand up to the test of time because</text>
  <text start="724.62" dur="9.21">it&amp;#39;s easier for them if there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="727.66" dur="6.17">control you know to keep them controlled</text>
  <text start="735.18" dur="10.39">okay now in the the Financial Times was</text>
  <text start="740.92" dur="7.53">hacked by the Syrian electronic army so</text>

  <text start="969.339" dur="9.93">and people will be angry and upset and</text>
  <text start="975.399" dur="6.96">want revenge and this is how they can</text>
  <text start="979.269" dur="5.97">get us into war so this cyber attack is</text>
  <text start="982.359" dur="4.65">going to be the main event it is going</text>
  <text start="985.239" dur="4.44">to be the big one that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="987.009" dur="5.07">seeing multiple smaller ones here now</text>
  <text start="989.679" dur="5.37">before they get to this stage they are</text>
  <text start="992.079" dur="5.12">going to try other events and there are</text>
  <text start="995.049" dur="7.35">a couple things that have been happening</text>
  <text start="997.199" dur="7.72">around the country and I started to list</text>
  <text start="1002.399" dur="6.03">them on the x 22 report com site on the</text>
  <text start="1004.919" dur="6.27">right sidebar you can see potential</text>
  <text start="1008.429" dur="5.52">false flags and I add the matrix I just</text>
  <text start="1011.189" dur="6.06">want to keep track of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1013.949" dur="5.67">with the dates and the times and this</text>
  <text start="1017.249" dur="6.15">way we can see when something happens</text>
  <text start="1019.619" dur="7.47">that our methodology of distinguishing</text>
  <text start="1023.399" dur="6.54">what&amp;#39;s going on is correct and basically</text>
  <text start="1027.089" dur="5.07">what I&amp;#39;m seeing is there was in a couple</text>
  <text start="1029.939" dur="4.681">episodes ago there was a terrorist super</text>
