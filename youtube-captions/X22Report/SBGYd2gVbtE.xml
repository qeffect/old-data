  <text start="165.69" dur="5.519">already started and this will accelerate</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re already seeing that there are</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="4.291">certain number of states that have</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="4.86">entered a recession in 2016 at the</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="4.92">beginning of 2016 numerous states</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="5.64">entered a recession based on new</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.22">research by Kansas fed economist Jason</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="5.72">round several states suffered severe</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="5.849">downturns as a third quarter of 2016 and</text>

  <text start="199.5" dur="6.75">North Dakota Louisiana West Virginia and</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="5.28">this is spreading so when we take a look</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="3.93">at the overall picture and we step back</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.31">we can see that industrial production</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="5.07">well that is declining and has been</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="4.8">declining rapidly and every time this</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.56">declines we are in a recession we are</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="4.53">starting to see many other indicators</text>

  <text start="231.87" dur="5.58">can&amp;#39;t find financing we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="5.55">see everything start to move forward</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="5.97">here in an accelerated pace where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="5.099">heading into this depression collapse</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="4.83">scenario when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="4.771">economic indicators I&amp;#39;m looking at this</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="4.739">and I&amp;#39;m seeing so many signaling a</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="5.25">recession already we are already in a</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="4.171">recession just that no one is admitted</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="3.57">to it and if we go back to two thousand</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="3.69">eight well no one really admitted that</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="5.61">we were in a recession in that entire</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="5.22">year until later on in 2009 then all of</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="3.18">a sudden they went backwards and today</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.02">you know something we were already in a</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="4.02">recession in 2008 the economy was</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="4.47">already falling apart and people warned</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="4.529">us that this was coming that the whole</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="3.3">thing was going to crash and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="3.481">seeing the same thing right now it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="4.41">unfolding right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="4.65">right now everything&amp;#39;s starting to fall</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="5.04">apart now on Friday we mentioned that</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="5.61">the White House apologized to the</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="4.8">British government about spying claims</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="7.14">and the corporate media was out there</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="8.279">saying that oh the u.s. apologized for</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="5.67">these claims and they even mentioned</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="5.851">different name Sean Spicer he apologized</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="5.449">general McMaster he apologized and of</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="5.489">course this was coming from an anonymous</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="5.861">intelligence source now we come to find</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="3.531">out the White House has responded to</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="4.49">this</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="5.88">and denied that this ever even happened</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.92">Sean Spicer said I don&amp;#39;t think we regret</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="5.25">anything we were just passing on news</text>
  <text start="323.75" dur="5.16">reports there was no apology made</text>
  <text start="326.39" dur="4.26">whatsoever and what we see happening in</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="3.81">the corporate media is they have a</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="3.72">certain agenda they have a certain</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="4.83">narrative that they want to keep up and</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="5.52">no matter what it costs no matter what</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="4.56">happens they&amp;#39;re trying to go down that</text>
  <text start="339.89" dur="3.72">path and this is why we&amp;#39;re getting all</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="3.39">these different kind of mix-ups yes you</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="4.59">can call it fake news but you can see</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="5.19">that they&amp;#39;re really trying to shape the</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="4.77">narrative of the story they want the</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="3.96">administration to talk about things they</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="4.74">want them to talk about and this is why</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="4.41">you see the battle going on between the</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="3.21">administration and the cover media</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="4.02">because the corporate media they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="360.92" dur="3.81">going out and just trying to shape the</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="3.9">narrative and the administration</text>
  <text start="364.73" dur="4.65">continually has to call them out on it</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="4.11">and say no this is not what has been</text>
  <text start="369.38" dur="3.48">said this is not what has been done and</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="4.92">this is why they continually say this is</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="6.51">completely fake find the facts report on</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="5.82">the facts now we know that the deep</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="4.38">state the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="5.19">continually pushing the idea of</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="5.94">censoring everyone and it is gone way</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="5.73">past an idea they are putting it into</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="5.46">motion and we mentioned that Google well</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re starting to look at their search</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="4.56">results and now they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="6.51">shape what they believe is offensive</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="6.33">content now again offensive content is</text>
  <text start="403.28" dur="4.71">very subjective it can mean many</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="3.69">different things to many people what</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="4.35">Sally finds offensive may not be</text>
  <text start="409.73" dur="3.87">offensive to Joe and vice versa now</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="4.47">because of the terms lack of definition</text>
  <text start="413.6" dur="5.94">is it it is up to us to give it</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="5.13">definition now this is dangerous because</text>
  <text start="419.54" dur="4.8">it invites people to use the word in a</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="4.44">way that best suits their own biases or</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="3.81">agendas and this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="3.75">happen with Google because now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="4.35">looking at their search results and</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying okay we believe this is</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="3.33">offensive now they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="3.18">rid of the results they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="4.08">push them down so you don&amp;#39;t even see</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="5.07">them again the corporate media does this</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="5.16">they say well if we don&amp;#39;t report on this</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="4.68">and we will admit it guess what it just</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="3.74">didn&amp;#39;t happen and we&amp;#39;re not lying either</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.16">well</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="5.609">you&amp;#39;re only showing you one viewpoint of</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="5.61">what they want to show you and that is</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="4.531">their agenda that&amp;#39;s their narrative</text>
  <text start="456.88" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s what they want you to see they</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t want you to see anything else they</text>
  <text start="460.72" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t want to see you they want you to</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="3.81">see both sides so if you&amp;#39;re doing a</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="4.14">search on Google and they start</text>
  <text start="465.91" dur="4.29">suppressing all these different websites</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="3.48">that have different opinions because</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="3.84">they believe it&amp;#39;s offensive you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="472.03" dur="4.2">even know that you&amp;#39;re being censored</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="3.66">because they&amp;#39;re hiding it from you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.23" dur="3.03">not like they&amp;#39;re saying okay this</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="3.6">website its sensors and you get a big</text>
  <text start="479.26" dur="4.53">you know red block on there so censored</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="4.26">you just won&amp;#39;t see it and this is why</text>
  <text start="483.79" dur="3.48">you have to compare their search results</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="3.84">with other search results if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="4.44">using google I like using different</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="4.59">search engines like DuckDuckGo Yandex</text>
  <text start="491.71" dur="4.41">and others and I compare them and see</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="5.64">what&amp;#39;s really out there that&amp;#39;s how you</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="7.109">find out the truth now Russia they are</text>
  <text start="499.63" dur="5.759">looking into the US media inside their</text>

  <text start="508.81" dur="5.31">investigation into the US media</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="6.12">organizations that operate in Russia now</text>
  <text start="514.12" dur="6.599">this was all started because of the</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="5.55">initiative by jeanne Shaheen who has</text>
  <text start="520.719" dur="3.601">introduced a bill to empower the Justice</text>

  <text start="681.66" dur="5.07">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="5.91">there are no peace talks that are being</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="5.17">held right now between all of these</text>

  <text start="703.33" dur="5.85">to stop the drills in South Korea they</text>
  <text start="706.12" dur="5.79">made a suggestion to North Korea and</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="6.96">they said listen here&amp;#39;s your alternative</text>
  <text start="711.91" dur="6.36">stop your nuclear program period well</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="4.59">ultimatum and it feels like we&amp;#39;re going</text>

  <text start="736.39" dur="3.87">in the middle you have to give something</text>
  <text start="738.25" dur="3.57">the other the country has to give</text>
  <text start="740.26" dur="3.54">something and you have to work together</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="3.24">you can&amp;#39;t give someone an ultimatum</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="3.21">because you know what that country is</text>
  <text start="745.06" dur="4.59">going to do well why should we do this</text>
  <text start="747.01" dur="4.56">if you&amp;#39;re doing absolutely nothing and</text>
  <text start="749.65" dur="5.01">this is what the United States is doing</text>
  <text start="751.57" dur="5.28">right now Tillerson said that any talks</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="5.1">on North Korea could only take place</text>
  <text start="756.85" dur="5.94">after it began the process of unwinding</text>
  <text start="759.76" dur="5.76">the weapons program well that&amp;#39;s again</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s the ultimatum and North Korea is</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="3.69">not going to stop we know this from all</text>
  <text start="767.95" dur="3.18">the other countries that United States</text>
  <text start="769.21" dur="4.29">try this on and this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="4.68">because they know the country is not</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="4.02">going to stop so throughout the</text>
  <text start="775.81" dur="4.77">corporate media right now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="777.52" dur="7.71">signs once again that they&amp;#39;re ready for</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="7.35">some type of war because already we sing</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="4.74">headlines like North Korea is getting</text>
  <text start="787.93" dur="4.68">close to the red line and when they</text>
  <text start="789.97" dur="3.81">start using these type of phrases where</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re going to be crossing the red</text>
  <text start="793.78" dur="4.65">line like they did with Syria back in</text>
  <text start="795.7" dur="4.14">August of 2013 when they said Syria is</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="3.78">going to be crossing a red line and once</text>
  <text start="799.84" dur="4.98">they cross the red line that&amp;#39;s it we</text>
  <text start="802.21" dur="6.87">brought in aircraft carriers submarines</text>
  <text start="804.82" dur="7.17">we were minutes away from bombing Syria</text>
  <text start="809.08" dur="5.73">the deep state almost had their wish and</text>
  <text start="811.99" dur="6.12">what happened was the case of the sarin</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="5.46">gas that Assad allegedly used was</text>
  <text start="818.11" dur="3.81">falling apart and they knew this and</text>
  <text start="820.27" dur="4.26">they weren&amp;#39;t going to get the resolution</text>
  <text start="821.92" dur="5.64">in the UN and it was starting to really</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="5.28">fall apart and all of a sudden Putin</text>
  <text start="827.56" dur="4.29">came out and said listen if Assad got</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="4.59">rid of the chemical weapons would you be</text>
  <text start="831.85" dur="4.23">satisfied with that and the US said yes</text>
  <text start="834.4" dur="3.21">and of course we knew this wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="836.08" dur="3.69">end of it we knew they were going to</text>
  <text start="837.61" dur="5.28">push us even further later on which they</text>
  <text start="839.77" dur="5.63">have and at that point everything</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="5.88">started to calm down and that was in</text>
  <text start="845.4" dur="4.09">2013 and that was a red line we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="3.36">seeing this</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="4.349">same thing once again this time it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="852.13" dur="3.93">little different we&amp;#39;re coming up to a</text>
  <text start="853.839" dur="4.681">point where they&amp;#39;ve run out of time the</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="4.98">economy is completely falling apart we</text>
  <text start="858.52" dur="4.95">see that an American landing ship USS</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="4.44">carter hall with Marines on board well</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="3.51">they cross the Bosphorus Strait and they</text>
  <text start="865.48" dur="3.54">arrived in the Black Sea now we know</text>
  <text start="866.98" dur="4.14">NATO ships are there we know US ships</text>
  <text start="869.02" dur="4.68">are there and they&amp;#39;re having joined</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="5.43">trills with the Romanian Navy in the</text>
  <text start="873.7" dur="5.94">Black Sea right now and again this is</text>
  <text start="876.55" dur="5.25">all about provoking Russia this is all</text>
  <text start="879.64" dur="4.71">about pushing the buttons of different</text>
  <text start="881.8" dur="4.92">countries we can see that Isis defenses</text>
  <text start="884.35" dur="4.59">in Syria they are completely collapsing</text>
  <text start="886.72" dur="5.01">right now we see in the provinces of</text>
  <text start="888.94" dur="5.1">Aleppo the Syrian army tiger forces they</text>
  <text start="891.73" dur="4.47">liberated many villages in this area</text>
  <text start="894.04" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve taken control of many of the</text>
  <text start="896.2" dur="5.639">areas they&amp;#39;ve taken control of military</text>
  <text start="898.36" dur="5.64">Depot&amp;#39;s the Palmyra gas field and we can</text>
  <text start="901.839" dur="5.221">see at this time at the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="904" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re done for they they have lost the</text>
  <text start="907.06" dur="5.61">initiative the Syrian forces the Russian</text>
  <text start="909.94" dur="4.5">forces they have practically driven them</text>
  <text start="912.67" dur="6.3">out of the country and then you have to</text>
  <text start="914.44" dur="7.709">wonder why are u.s. troops being brought</text>
  <text start="918.97" dur="5.94">into Syria because it&amp;#39;s not to get the</text>
  <text start="922.149" dur="6.93">Islamic state it&amp;#39;s to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="924.91" dur="6.9">to get Assad or to split up Syria that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.079" dur="6.391">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now now Robert</text>
  <text start="931.81" dur="7.41">david steele ex-cia he was talking about</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="5.73">how Soros Obama they were going to push</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="4.17">their agenda in the spring when the</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="4.05">weather got warm he said they were going</text>
  <text start="943.39" dur="4.68">to start pushing their agenda to remove</text>
  <text start="945.25" dur="6.72">Trump and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="948.07" dur="6.48">that senators six US senators led by</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="4.92">mike-lee from the state of Utah called</text>
  <text start="954.55" dur="4.74">on secretary Rex Tillerson which were</text>
  <text start="956.89" dur="5.49">reported on before to start an</text>
  <text start="959.29" dur="4.739">investigation on Soros and the reason</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="5.04">why they want this done right now is</text>
  <text start="964.029" dur="6.721">because they realize that he is planning</text>
  <text start="967.42" dur="5.31">on something come the spring in the new</text>
  <text start="970.75" dur="6.72">york times already we can see that</text>

  <text start="980.35" dur="5">upholding basic immigration laws</text>
  <text start="982.78" dur="5.04">hate speak and many other things and</text>
  <text start="985.35" dur="5.95">basically what he&amp;#39;s doing right now is</text>
  <text start="987.82" dur="6.78">that he&amp;#39;s urging americans to fight back</text>
  <text start="991.3" dur="6.72">against Trump so what we&amp;#39;re seeing at</text>
  <text start="994.6" dur="6.63">this point is that he is now calling the</text>
  <text start="998.02" dur="6.21">troops to get ready and prepare for</text>
  <text start="1001.23" dur="4.23">something coming up to spring and he</text>
  <text start="1004.23" dur="4.2">announced that he&amp;#39;s going to be spending</text>
  <text start="1005.46" dur="5.25">ten million dollars to provide legal and</text>

  <text start="1021.9" dur="4.71">what he does with his money we know what</text>
  <text start="1024.57" dur="3.54">he tries to do I mean Russia kicked them</text>
  <text start="1026.61" dur="4.04">out of the country because they realized</text>
  <text start="1028.11" dur="5.6">these all these non-governmental</text>
  <text start="1030.65" dur="6.73">organizations they weren&amp;#39;t there to</text>
  <text start="1033.71" dur="6.97">spread peace and unity they were used to</text>
  <text start="1037.38" dur="6.03">create riots protests to overthrow the</text>
  <text start="1040.68" dur="6.35">government to cause chaos we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="1043.41" dur="7.29">across America and his whole entire</text>
  <text start="1047.03" dur="6.31">narrative right now is fighting against</text>
  <text start="1050.7" dur="6.81">hate crimes makes us grow stronger</text>
  <text start="1053.34" dur="8.01">together so he&amp;#39;s trying to create this</text>
  <text start="1057.51" dur="6.33">movement to bring everyone together who</text>
  <text start="1061.35" dur="5.01">believes that Trump is creating hate</text>
  <text start="1063.84" dur="5.25">crimes across America and we know that</text>
  <text start="1066.36" dur="5.1">Hillary right now well she&amp;#39;s saying</text>

  <text start="1071.46" dur="4.47">has her tagline rise up America and</text>
  <text start="1073.92" dur="4.47">fight those who disagree without with</text>
  <text start="1075.93" dur="5.25">your opinion so we can grow stronger</text>
  <text start="1078.39" dur="6.18">together so at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1081.18" dur="7.02">rallying the troops we know Obama has a</text>
  <text start="1084.57" dur="6.24">war room with Valerie Jarrett Eric</text>
