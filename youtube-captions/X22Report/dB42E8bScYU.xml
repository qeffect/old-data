  <text start="53.38" dur="6">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.34" dur="5.91">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="59.38" dur="6.84">episode 1356 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="63.25" dur="5.13">August 15 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="66.22" dur="3.69">episode is the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="68.38" dur="5.16">become desperate they&amp;#39;re asking people</text>
  <text start="69.91" dur="5.85">to do the following let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="73.54" dur="4.08">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="75.76" dur="5.219">we&amp;#39;re starting to see different</text>
  <text start="77.62" dur="5.85">countries pretty much do the same thing</text>
  <text start="80.979" dur="4.321">that the United States did as they were</text>
  <text start="83.47" dur="4.92">pumping up the illusion</text>
  <text start="85.3" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve gotten to the point where all</text>
  <text start="88.39" dur="6.24">these statistical numbers that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="91" dur="7.14">pushing out they&amp;#39;re countering what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.63" dur="6.27">really going on and it&amp;#39;s becoming harder</text>
  <text start="98.14" dur="6.3">and harder to explain why the economy</text>
  <text start="100.9" dur="6.12">isn&amp;#39;t doing as well as these numbers say</text>
  <text start="104.44" dur="3.6">the economy is doing because think about</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="4.62">it for a second here in the United</text>
  <text start="108.04" dur="5.4">States we have retail completely</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="3.81">crashing we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="113.44" dur="5.52">closing a lot of people are losing their</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="7.619">jobs but the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="6.51">government the Fed they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="123.069" dur="5.731">pushing out statistics that everything</text>
  <text start="125.47" dur="7.26">is a-okay and when you see stores</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="5.19">closing down in malls in strip malls you</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="3.839">scratch your head and you say what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.99" dur="4.68">going on here and there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="4.201">ways where they can manipulate all this</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="4.74">I mean if we go back in time where the</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="5.25">United States decided to give cash for</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="5.46">clunkers they were trying to boost the</text>
  <text start="146.02" dur="5.13">automobile industry now this was to</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="3.93">create the illusion that things were</text>
  <text start="151.15" dur="5.28">going well to get people to purchase</text>
  <text start="152.8" dur="6.96">cars and we see Europe they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="5.4">same exact thing now Volkswagen a German</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="5.67">car bram announced it will be paying up</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="6.69">to ten thousand euros per your old car</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="6.48">of any brand if you trade it in for a</text>
  <text start="168.52" dur="6.81">brand new Volkswagen in Germany and then</text>
  <text start="171.91" dur="4.86">just a few days later Opel which is</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="4.65">previously owned by General Motors</text>
  <text start="176.77" dur="6.26">but now owned by PSA the French brand</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re doing this same exact thing and</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re offering around 7,000 euros if</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="2.41">they trade in</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="3.21">their old car doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="4.35">Opel or not doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="4.92">brand is as long as you buy a new Opel</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="5.7">so they&amp;#39;re doing the same type of</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="5.67">incentive program that the u.s. did</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="6.21">which was called cash for clunkers and</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;re trying to boost car sales to</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="5.939">save the failing car industry because</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="4.289">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="5.67">automobile industry they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="213.319" dur="6.811">very tough time now of course does this</text>
  <text start="216.769" dur="5.19">really save the industry no it gives it</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="3.419">a little bump up for a little time being</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="4.11">and then everything completely falls</text>
  <text start="223.549" dur="4.561">apart afterwards and there&amp;#39;s other ways</text>
  <text start="226.069" dur="3.75">they can manipulate the numbers just</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="3.51">like here in the United States they like</text>
  <text start="229.819" dur="3.661">the channel stuff remember every time</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="4.11">they bring a car onto the lot it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="3.9">considered a set a sale it&amp;#39;s not when</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="3.06">they sell the car it&amp;#39;s when they bring</text>
  <text start="237.38" dur="4.68">it onto the lot so they can make the</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="7.02">numbers look fantastic and Ron used to</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="6.03">do incredible accounting tricks where</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="4.83">they made everything look fantastic and</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="5.64">look what happened to them Bernie Madoff</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="4.92">he had a whole Ponzi scheme going people</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="3.569">thought they were making tons of money</text>
  <text start="255.56" dur="4.679">but look what happened to him</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="5.641">all of these schemes always come to an</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.581">end now what&amp;#39;s very interesting the</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="5.01">corporate media the government they came</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="4.409">out and they&amp;#39;re telling you how great US</text>
  <text start="267.95" dur="3.81">retail sales are in July they just</text>
  <text start="270.229" dur="4.171">they&amp;#39;re just fantastic</text>
  <text start="271.76" dur="6.06">everything rebounded and everything is</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="7.079">going smoothly and very very well now</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="6.24">remember we&amp;#39;ve had declining two</text>
  <text start="281.479" dur="5.341">straight months of US retail sales and</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="4.35">then all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="4.05">about this point six percent</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="6.09">month-on-month game now this is the most</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="6.84">since December 2016 but this was driven</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="5.25">by a surge in Motor Vehicles because</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="4.709">remember the car companies are trying to</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="4.71">move the cars on the lot because they</text>
  <text start="302.419" dur="3.601">Channel stuffed all the lots and what</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re giving huge</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="6.09">incentives cash back zero percent</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="4.65">lowering the prices now they did this</text>
  <text start="312.11" dur="4.32">prior to 2008 and the car industry got</text>
  <text start="314.66" dur="4.68">into trouble they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="4.65">thing right now we also have to look at</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="4.56">the retail sales</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="6.42">and they had been revised away magically</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="7.259">and all of a sudden we see for the last</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="6.539">couple of months where retail sales have</text>
  <text start="331.159" dur="6.69">been improving now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="334.039" dur="5.91">that a lot of stores they already</text>
  <text start="337.849" dur="3.87">started to close there&amp;#39;s a lot more that</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="4.71">will be closing and we need to</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="6.361">understand how they calculate retail</text>
  <text start="344.659" dur="6.891">sales remember this is an estimate this</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="6.839">isn&amp;#39;t the actual numbers that the</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="6.28">retailers put out and from all these</text>
  <text start="354.919" dur="5.34">retailers that are closing what the</text>
  <text start="357.83" dur="5.61">government likes to do is they like to</text>
  <text start="360.259" dur="5.34">take all the declining sales and they</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="4.74">like to spread it out over many many</text>
  <text start="365.599" dur="4.801">months so if you have ten stores closing</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="3.78">and the stores just come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="3.419">halt and the sales just come to a</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="3.63">screeching halt they don&amp;#39;t say okay</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="4.32">sales are way down they take those</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="4.59">numbers out they massage them and bring</text>
  <text start="378.139" dur="3.99">them out over many many months so what</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="382.129" dur="4.621">manipulation of retail sales to make</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="3.539">everyone believe that retail is doing</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="3.539">much much better than it is now</text>
  <text start="388.279" dur="3.39">everything rose except for clothing</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="3.541">stores are down by negative point two</text>
  <text start="391.669" dur="3.36">percent electronics and appliance stores</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re down by negative point five</text>
  <text start="395.029" dur="4.56">percent and gasoline stations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="4.679">down by negative point four percent now</text>
  <text start="399.589" dur="4.561">was very interesting a research company</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="3.75">called South Bay Research they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="3.66">looking at the numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.949" dur="4.02">saying something just doesn&amp;#39;t sound</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="5.759">right because remember just like two</text>
  <text start="409.969" dur="6.42">weeks ago the auto industry their sales</text>
  <text start="413.569" dur="5.97">were absolutely awful think about GM</text>
  <text start="416.389" dur="5.43">they were down 15% year-on-year Ford was</text>
  <text start="419.539" dur="6.451">off by 7% Chrysler down by 11 per site</text>
  <text start="421.819" dur="7.02">11% now according to the retail sales</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="5.489">report from the Census Bureau sales for</text>
  <text start="428.839" dur="5.67">Motor Vehicles and part stores rose much</text>
  <text start="431.479" dur="7.231">more robust robustly than anyone had</text>
  <text start="434.509" dur="8.19">anticipated rising 1.2 percent the</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="5.699">fastest paints since December now these</text>
  <text start="442.699" dur="5.041">numbers are kind of strange and very</text>
  <text start="444.409" dur="6.031">bizarre because they&amp;#39;re completely out</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.459">of context with readings recent sales</text>
  <text start="450.44" dur="4.56">data and South Bay research while they</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="4.711">looked at the numbers and they said this</text>
  <text start="455" dur="5.22">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense and when you</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="2.61">look at it it really doesn&amp;#39;t think about</text>
  <text start="460.22" dur="3.81">it</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="8.1">consumer retail spending was actually</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="7.32">mild it didn&amp;#39;t improve and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="5.16">wondering where did these numbers come</text>
  <text start="471.35" dur="6.03">from and they&amp;#39;re saying don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="7.02">the auto sales data per the be ei unit</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="6.33">sales were completely flat so there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="5.82">rise in auto sales per the real world</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="5.61">and they ve a couple with a fall in debt</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="4.65">prices but in the fantasy land of the</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="5.01">Census Bureau they&amp;#39;re making it seem</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="5.82">like everything is fine now South Bay</text>
  <text start="494.33" dur="5.91">they have this index called the vise</text>
  <text start="497.09" dur="6">index and for those who are unfamiliar</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="4.28">with device index attracts US consumer</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="4.23">spending on alcohol marijuana</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="5.23">prostitution gambling vices are a</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="5.159">special form of discretionary spending</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="6.659">that is highly sensitive to near-term</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="6.571">economic conditions one its cash based</text>
  <text start="516.409" dur="5.13">depends on free cash flow to luxury</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.1">spending once not needs three</text>
  <text start="521.539" dur="4.681">significant dollar amount not pricy but</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="4.26">not cheap by spending is broadly</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="4.5">representative of the US consumer and</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="4.95">the reason why this index is a</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="5.01">particular interest is because vices</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="5.76">predict retail spending with a four</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="4.74">month lead luxury spending is the first</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="4.05">thing to be affected by changes in</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="6.18">household finances and when you look at</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="6.9">the index the index is down around</text>
  <text start="546.65" dur="5.99">negative two percent which shows that</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="5.43">people aren&amp;#39;t going out and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="5.26">purchasing so these numbers that the</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="6.44">Census Bureau is putting out is once</text>
  <text start="557.9" dur="7.439">again fake phony and false they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="5.77">backed up by any type of reality these</text>
  <text start="565.339" dur="4.231">are estimates and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="567.71" dur="4.02">it look like because this is what they</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="5.4">expected to happen they wanted everyone</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="6.09">to believe that the retail industry was</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="6.63">doing well but we can see from Dick&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="7.56">Sporting stores well they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="6.42">that well at all now Dick&amp;#39;s stocks they</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="3.47">crashed after reporting dreadful results</text>
  <text start="588.02" dur="3.739">this morning</text>
  <text start="588.85" dur="4.439">they&amp;#39;re both comp sales and EPS they</text>
  <text start="591.759" dur="3.66">missed as the company slashed its</text>
  <text start="593.289" dur="5.22">full-year guidance below even the lowest</text>
  <text start="595.419" dur="5.88">sell side forecast and the CEO was out</text>
  <text start="598.509" dur="6.211">there and the CEO ed stack he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="601.299" dur="5.43">that they looked at the consumer market</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="4.589">and the consumers have told them that</text>
  <text start="606.729" dur="5.25">their prices are not competitive in</text>
  <text start="609.309" dur="5.01">today&amp;#39;s environment and they need to</text>
  <text start="611.979" dur="3.78">lower the prices now what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="3.3">to have to do is they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="615.759" dur="3.36">to give deep discounts and this is what</text>
  <text start="617.619" dur="3.99">they started to do but we can see right</text>
  <text start="619.119" dur="4.77">now that people aren&amp;#39;t running out and</text>
  <text start="621.609" dur="4.95">purchasing people are looking for deals</text>
  <text start="623.889" dur="5.79">why because they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to</text>
  <text start="626.559" dur="5.73">pay for these expensive items they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="629.679" dur="4.981">rather go shopping and they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="632.289" dur="5.58">find deals when they need to purchase</text>
  <text start="634.66" dur="6.209">something so the time of the expensive</text>
  <text start="637.869" dur="5.94">stores where they&amp;#39;re charging the high</text>
  <text start="640.869" dur="5.22">prices that is coming to an end because</text>
  <text start="643.809" dur="4.11">as more and more people lose jobs more</text>
  <text start="646.089" dur="4.29">more people making less jobs as wages</text>
  <text start="647.919" dur="4.92">continually fall guess what happens</text>
  <text start="650.379" dur="5.1">people look at dick&amp;#39;s they look at maybe</text>
  <text start="652.839" dur="4.71">Amazon they look at other retailers and</text>
  <text start="655.479" dur="3.96">say you know something I don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="657.549" dur="4.26">spend that much there I can spend it</text>
  <text start="659.439" dur="4.44">someplace else and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.809" dur="4.05">happening in these stores are going to</text>
  <text start="663.879" dur="5.19">get hurt because their entire model is</text>
  <text start="665.859" dur="5.94">built on the cost structure of having</text>
  <text start="669.069" dur="5.34">these items at a certain price level and</text>
  <text start="671.799" dur="6.18">once they start reducing it guess what</text>
  <text start="674.409" dur="6.99">they lose profit and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="677.979" dur="6.3">happening across being the entire United</text>
  <text start="681.399" dur="5.1">States with the retail sector even with</text>
  <text start="684.279" dur="4.321">online because just because it&amp;#39;s online</text>
  <text start="686.499" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s cheap I mean I&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="688.6" dur="5.549">to Amazon before and I found a product</text>
  <text start="691.509" dur="4.62">and I&amp;#39;ve gone to a store or a</text>
  <text start="694.149" dur="4.26">brick-and-mortar store and I found that</text>
  <text start="696.129" dur="4.23">Amazon was more expensive than the</text>
  <text start="698.409" dur="4.2">brick-and-mortar store so these</text>
  <text start="700.359" dur="5.4">retailers today all of them even online</text>
  <text start="702.609" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;re going to have to change because</text>
  <text start="705.759" dur="6.841">the spending habits of people that is</text>
  <text start="710.079" dur="5.28">changing now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="712.6" dur="5.699">that the Fed now we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="715.359" dur="6.48">before there&amp;#39;s one thing the Fed can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.299" dur="4.361">make people do that is spend money now</text>
  <text start="721.839" dur="3.521">they can</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="5.15">people take loans out well you have to</text>
  <text start="725.36" dur="5.159">go to college college is too expensive</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="5.709">take a loan out you want to purchase a</text>
  <text start="730.519" dur="4.8">house well take a loan out because you</text>
  <text start="733.519" dur="6.06">can definitely not you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="735.319" dur="5.971">be putting down 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a million</text>
  <text start="739.579" dur="4.291">dollars on a house it&amp;#39;s just not going</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="4.77">to happen most of the people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="743.87" dur="4.38">that type of cash if you&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="746.06" dur="5.67">purchase a car you&amp;#39;re not going to shell</text>
  <text start="748.25" dur="5.55">out 20 30 40 50 thousand dollars for a</text>
  <text start="751.73" dur="3.63">new car so you&amp;#39;re not most likely not</text>
  <text start="753.8" dur="3.75">even going to finance it most people are</text>
  <text start="755.36" dur="5.159">leasing today because it&amp;#39;s just too</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="6">expensive the incomes the wages have not</text>
  <text start="760.519" dur="6.481">kept up with the inflation on</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="6.389">automobiles on houses on college tuition</text>
  <text start="767" dur="7.17">and that&amp;#39;s where we are seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="769.939" dur="7.65">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="774.17" dur="4.979">housing bubble right now well it is</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="4.35">started again now I&amp;#39;m going to bring</text>
  <text start="779.149" dur="5.011">this all in to what the Fed wants</text>
  <text start="781.939" dur="4.95">everyone to do now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="6.239">people that are purchasing homes with</text>
  <text start="786.889" dur="5.971">less than 10 percent down so what</text>
  <text start="790.399" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re looking at right now and this is</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="3.75">coming from Black Knight Black Knight</text>
  <text start="794.509" dur="4.44">financial services they&amp;#39;re pointing out</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="4.649">that down payments the fairy thing that</text>
  <text start="798.949" dur="6.721">is supposed to deter rampant housing</text>
  <text start="801.259" dur="6.39">speculation well it&amp;#39;s now much easier</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="4.68">for people to go purchase a house</text>
  <text start="807.649" dur="4.8">because what they&amp;#39;re seeing is about 1.5</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="3.9">million bars have purchased a home with</text>
  <text start="812.449" dur="4.711">less than 10 percent down this is a</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="6.329">seven-year high and with housing prices</text>
  <text start="817.16" dur="5.669">continually moving up people think wow I</text>
  <text start="820.579" dur="4.851">put less than 10 percent down I bought</text>
  <text start="822.829" dur="5.101">my house at 200,000 and now it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="825.43" dur="4.899">225,000 because the Fed has been blowing</text>
  <text start="827.93" dur="5.459">up the bubble why have they been doing</text>
  <text start="830.329" dur="6.12">this because what they want people to do</text>
  <text start="833.389" dur="5.341">is they want them to feel good about</text>
  <text start="836.449" dur="4.531">their purchase they want people to say</text>
  <text start="838.73" dur="6.39">you know something I&amp;#39;m doing well I have</text>
  <text start="840.98" dur="7.26">my job and I have my home and my home is</text>
  <text start="845.12" dur="5.55">going up in price that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="4.909">trying to do and when people feel good</text>
  <text start="850.67" dur="5.43">and they see their house you know</text>
  <text start="853.149" dur="7.091">appreciating it makes them feel</text>
  <text start="856.1" dur="7.59">confident now the Fed wants people to</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="8.339">take that money out of the house said</text>
  <text start="863.69" dur="7.23">Dudley well he is saying that listen we</text>
  <text start="868.579" dur="5.911">need everyone to tap their home equity</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="6.089">right now real estate has gone up we</text>
  <text start="874.49" dur="4.469">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s coming down and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="877.009" dur="5.461">made quite a bit of money on your homes</text>
  <text start="878.959" dur="8.731">it is now time to tap into the home</text>
  <text start="882.47" dur="9.359">equity and go out and purchase goods now</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="6.87">we saw this once before this was in 2008</text>
  <text start="891.829" dur="3.901">and a lot of people because of the</text>
  <text start="894.56" dur="2.82">appreciation in their homes they felt</text>
  <text start="895.73" dur="3.15">very comfortable where they went and</text>
  <text start="897.38" dur="3.899">they took a home equity line of credit</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="4.47">they took that money they bought a car</text>
  <text start="901.279" dur="4.411">they bought any other type of product a</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="4.56">high ticket item product because they</text>
  <text start="905.69" dur="4.53">were able to take the home equity line</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="4.02">out of their house and they were able to</text>
  <text start="910.22" dur="4.169">use this someplace else and what</text>
  <text start="911.93" dur="4.68">happened later on well everything was a</text>
  <text start="914.389" dur="4.591">complete disaster so basically what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.61" dur="6.06">saying is that your house once again is</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="5.19">an ATM and now is the time to do it why</text>
  <text start="922.67" dur="3.899">is he saying it right now because he</text>
  <text start="924.17" dur="5.159">knows that there&amp;#39;s only a small window</text>
  <text start="926.569" dur="4.801">because the housing market is not doing</text>
  <text start="929.329" dur="5.281">well and he knows that prices are</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="6.199">starting to fall and he wants people to</text>
  <text start="934.61" dur="6.659">go out and to spend to keep the system</text>
  <text start="937.569" dur="5.351">operational and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="941.269" dur="3.841">bankers do think about what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="942.92" dur="4.44">doing because they&amp;#39;re becoming so</text>
  <text start="945.11" dur="4.26">desperate that they need to do all these</text>
  <text start="947.36" dur="4.229">things they need to offer 0% interest</text>
  <text start="949.37" dur="4.26">they need to tell you to take your home</text>
  <text start="951.589" dur="4.141">equity line and go spend in retail</text>
  <text start="953.63" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re doing all of these things</text>
  <text start="955.73" dur="3.75">because this is the end game right here</text>
  <text start="958.22" dur="2.669">they have nothing else to do and the</text>
  <text start="959.48" dur="3.959">only way they can get people to spend is</text>
  <text start="960.889" dur="4.44">to give them funds and if they if you</text>
  <text start="963.439" dur="3.84">tell people you know listen</text>
  <text start="965.329" dur="3.841">0% interest go out and get a home equity</text>
  <text start="967.279" dur="3.11">line a credit go out and spend your</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="3.33">house is just going to go up in value</text>
  <text start="970.389" dur="4.541">everything&amp;#39;s going to be great people</text>
  <text start="972.5" dur="4.5">most people will say oh okay that sounds</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="4.829">great now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="977" dur="6.029">all of this is that the Fed also issued</text>
  <text start="979.759" dur="6.45">a warning that household debt has hit an</text>
  <text start="983.029" dur="6.241">all-time new high where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="986.209" dur="7.861">that the US credit card debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="6.45">above where it was in 2008 so on one</text>
  <text start="994.07" dur="3.87">side of the mouth of the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="995.72" dur="5.58">telling us that hey listen it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="997.94" dur="4.709">time to take out another loan on the</text>
  <text start="1001.3" dur="4.62">other side they&amp;#39;re issuing a warning</text>
  <text start="1002.649" dur="7.351">that US credit card debt is at an</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="6.18">all-time high and this is very</text>
  <text start="1010" dur="4.05">concerning to the Fed because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1012.1" dur="4.53">believe that this debt level can be</text>
  <text start="1014.05" dur="6.72">sustained well as we can see back in</text>
  <text start="1016.63" dur="7.11">2008 it couldn&amp;#39;t be sustained it was a</text>
  <text start="1020.77" dur="6.299">complete disaster so this is what it</text>
  <text start="1023.74" dur="6.51">looks like at the end stage of their</text>
  <text start="1027.069" dur="5.221">fire system they&amp;#39;re flip-flopping back</text>
  <text start="1030.25" dur="5.069">and forth they&amp;#39;re just trying to get</text>
  <text start="1032.29" dur="6.45">everyone to spend funds to take out more</text>
  <text start="1035.319" dur="5.971">loans then warning them that we might</text>
  <text start="1038.74" dur="5.88">have a problem but of course they keep</text>
  <text start="1041.29" dur="6.269">that part very very quiet and we can see</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="5.34">right now that we are headed toward a</text>
  <text start="1047.559" dur="5.131">complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="1049.96" dur="5.82">the indicators that we have been looking</text>
  <text start="1052.69" dur="6">at they&amp;#39;re all pointing to the same</text>
  <text start="1055.78" dur="6.17">thing and a lot of them are 10 times</text>
  <text start="1058.69" dur="7.2">worse than 2008 and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1061.95" dur="6.22">this these numbers that were looking at</text>
  <text start="1065.89" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re manipulated or massaged they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1068.17" dur="6.9">fake just like the triple-a rating on</text>
  <text start="1071.11" dur="8.88">the subprime securities back in 2006</text>
  <text start="1075.07" dur="9.66">2007 2008 it was fake it was an illusion</text>
  <text start="1079.99" dur="7.74">to draw people in we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="6.24">thing once again and they manipulated</text>
  <text start="1087.73" dur="4.77">the entire economy this time and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1090.97" dur="3.959">drawing as many people in as they</text>
  <text start="1092.5" dur="4.71">possibly can and it&amp;#39;s going to end in</text>
  <text start="1094.929" dur="4.801">the disaster this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="1097.21" dur="5.61">ready and prepared because sooner or</text>
  <text start="1099.73" dur="3.81">later the illusion always ends it always</text>
  <text start="1102.82" dur="3.27">does</text>
  <text start="1103.54" dur="4.32">people can say it&amp;#39;s not going to until</text>
  <text start="1106.09" dur="3.42">it does and then people just you know</text>
  <text start="1107.86" dur="3.54">scurry away and you never hear from</text>
  <text start="1109.51" dur="3.45">those people again and everyone who</text>
  <text start="1111.4" dur="3.029">listened to those people are sitting</text>
  <text start="1112.96" dur="4.59">there going oh I should have prepared</text>
  <text start="1114.429" dur="8.611">because all those times before the you</text>
  <text start="1117.55" dur="7.65">know 2001 2008 nothing was fixed the can</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="4.56">was kicked down the street they created</text>
  <text start="1125.2" dur="3.36">a lot more currency they made everything</text>
  <text start="1127.6" dur="3.84">worse</text>
  <text start="1128.56" dur="6.57">by pretending everything was better by</text>
  <text start="1131.44" dur="6.27">manipulating the entire economy and here</text>
  <text start="1135.13" dur="4.2">we sit today and from everything that</text>
  <text start="1137.71" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re looking at from all the different</text>
  <text start="1139.33" dur="5.19">indicators it&amp;#39;s all coming together it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1142.33" dur="3.95">almost like a perfect storm where all</text>
  <text start="1144.52" dur="5.28">these things are coming together and</text>
  <text start="1146.28" dur="5.53">eventually the Fed will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1149.8" dur="4.97">stop it the economy will start to</text>
  <text start="1151.81" dur="6.54">deteriorate it will start to crash and</text>
  <text start="1154.77" dur="4.99">it will continue on and the Fed the</text>
  <text start="1158.35" dur="2.43">government they won&amp;#39;t be able to do</text>
  <text start="1159.76" dur="4.35">anything the only thing we&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="1160.78" dur="5.49">do is to start the stimulus up once</text>
  <text start="1164.11" dur="4.95">again and is that going to fix the</text>
  <text start="1166.27" dur="5.43">problem no and that&amp;#39;s why you need to be</text>
