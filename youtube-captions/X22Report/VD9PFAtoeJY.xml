  <text start="90.79" dur="4.59">central bank the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="93.49" dur="4.169">going to make it very very difficult and</text>
  <text start="95.38" dur="5.64">we need to clear something up right off</text>
  <text start="97.659" dur="5.581">the bat here for this system to get out</text>
  <text start="101.02" dur="3.45">of this central bank system you just</text>
  <text start="103.24" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t say hey you know something</text>
  <text start="104.47" dur="6.57">we don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore the</text>
  <text start="106.96" dur="6.199">only way out is to destroy it now think</text>
  <text start="111.04" dur="5.49">about what is happening out in the UK</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="6.671">right now Teresa may put together this</text>
  <text start="116.53" dur="7.47">terrible deal pushing it on the people</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="6.45">that wanted to leave the EU and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124" dur="2.97">saying that this is going to be good for</text>
  <text start="126.28" dur="3.869">the country</text>
  <text start="126.97" dur="5.61">now look at the deal it&amp;#39;s weighted</text>
  <text start="130.149" dur="5.041">towards the central bank it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="5.549">weighted towards the people why because</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="5.939">the central bank will never let</text>
  <text start="138.129" dur="6.151">countries leave now the EU is</text>
  <text start="141.129" dur="5.94">threatening the UK access to security</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="5.489">database for terrorism and things like</text>
  <text start="147.069" dur="4.651">that if they don&amp;#39;t accept the plan this</text>
  <text start="149.769" dur="6.121">is what the central bank does they</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="8.52">threaten countries people groups if they</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t do what they want and we see at</text>
  <text start="160.24" dur="4.2">this point that the people are very</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="4.59">upset with this deal there</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="5.25">our leaders that are resigning because</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="6.6">of this deal and it&amp;#39;s not in the best</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="6.48">interest of the people now in Italy we</text>
  <text start="173.32" dur="5.67">see that 60% of Italians they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="5.85">thinking about you know maybe the EU is</text>
  <text start="178.99" dur="4.71">not good for our country maybe we need</text>
  <text start="182.02" dur="3.99">to leave also and I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="4.35">to happen here is as borer country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="3.78">catch on to what&amp;#39;s really going on here</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="3.69">and they see what is happening out in</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="3.9">the UK they&amp;#39;re gonna start to realize</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="4.59">well wait a minute this country wanted</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="5.31">to leave the EU block and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="196.33" dur="5.43">threatening them saying that they will</text>
  <text start="199" dur="7.11">make it very very difficult to ever</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="8.49">leave in the people&amp;#39;s favor and they are</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="6.84">stuck with the central bank dictating</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="3.93">what they should do and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="3.48">countries are gonna start to wake up</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="6.21">from this and I think there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="7.38">be a huge shift and this is what the</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="8.01">central banks are trying to stop now out</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="6.75">in Italy the European Commission they</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="4.92">want to levy billions of fines against</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="7.38">the Italian government and this is like</text>
  <text start="233.32" dur="9">a punishment to Italy and 60 million</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="6.09">Italians will rise up if this does</text>
  <text start="242.32" dur="4.68">happen now this is coming from the Prime</text>
  <text start="244.03" dur="6.09">Minister Matteo salvini saying listen if</text>
  <text start="247" dur="5">you place these fines on Italy of course</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s going to hurt the people there</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.769">people are going to rise up against you</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="7.11">and it&amp;#39;s not going to end up well for</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="5.761">the central bank system so we could see</text>
  <text start="262" dur="5.22">that countries they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="7.639">understand what is happening here so how</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="7.05">do you get rid of a central bank system</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="5.201">well you have to push it to the edge now</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="4.2">remember central bank systems they only</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.02">last 40 to 45 years maybe they can go a</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="3.51">little bit longer like this one because</text>
  <text start="280.39" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re continually creating currency</text>
  <text start="281.98" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re holding it together they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="3.12">manipulating the data but eventually</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="4.47">what happens everything just breaks down</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="4.83">and they can&amp;#39;t stop it so they know that</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re running out of time tick tock</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="3.63">tick tock they&amp;#39;re running out of time</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="4.96">this is why they wanted a war some type</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="5.17">of an event to cover up everything</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="5.51">in the mean time we see that Trump and</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="6.3">the Patriots they are preparing for the</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="5.77">total destruction of the central banking</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="5.73">economic system this is their currency</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="5.97">system now remember countries around the</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="5.19">world leaders around the world were part</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="4.47">of this system they were part of the</text>
  <text start="317.54" dur="4.14">deep state part of the central bank</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="4.38">system they wanted the central bank</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.56">system they made a huge amount of money</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="3.54">off of the central bank system they</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t want it to see it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="5.58">to see it gone they like it they like</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="4.92">having the central bank and they were</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="6.57">preparing for a completely different</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="8.1">plan now everything has changed and the</text>
  <text start="339.89" dur="5.4">push to destroy the system is still on</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="4.35">now the system was gonna go down no</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="4.77">matter which way you looked at it it all</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="4.38">depends on who had the narrative when</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="3.03">Obama was president they were hoping</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="3.12">Hillary Clinton would come in the</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="4.08">central bank would control the narrative</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="4.74">and they would still be in power even</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="4.95">other system was was gonna you know</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="5.79">collapse they were going to cover it up</text>
  <text start="362.12" dur="5.43">and blame its I know on the war on</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="6.48">another country and they were going to</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="8.1">restart it later on today their plan is</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="8.22">not working Trump&amp;#39;s plan the Patriots</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="6.48">plan this plan is working and the</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.56">central bank has no place to hide right</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="5.01">now they don&amp;#39;t have an event they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="5.58">have a war they don&amp;#39;t have a country to</text>
  <text start="387.14" dur="3.96">blame all of this on so all the blame is</text>
  <text start="390.02" dur="3.57">going to be coming back to them now</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="4.8">countries they were going to prepare for</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="4.86">this no matter what and we see that</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="4.86">countries are continually preparing for</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="5.4">this what are they doing well if you</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="5.34">know a system is going to crash what do</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="4.53">you get rid of you get rid of your paper</text>
  <text start="406.1" dur="4.53">assets from that country like Treasuries</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="4.53">China has been dumping we know Russia</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ve dumped almost all of it I mean</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;ve been dumping quite a bit Japan</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="8.34">right now they dropped two billion this</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="6.72">is the lowest since 2011 France they are</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="4.65">dropping Treasury Holdings they went</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="4.2">from a hundred and eighteen billion down</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="5.52">to 97</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="8.73">seven billion we see Ireland they sold</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="6.93">25 billion and if we continually look at</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="3.72">this we see country after country they</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="3.35">are getting rid of their Treasuries what</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="5.31">country&amp;#39;s purchasing right now</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="6.97">well the Saudis are remember the Saudis</text>

  <text start="451.88" dur="6.75">still control the Saudis and they are</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="5.55">purchasing a lot of Treasuries they hold</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="4.23">a lot of paper and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="460.94" dur="5.88">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.25">countries they are still doing what they</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="2.91">were going to do no matter what because</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="3">this was still part of the plan they</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="3.03">knew the economic system was going to</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="4.2">come down they knew it was going to be</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="7.2">covered up they knew that there was</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="7.44">going to be an event eventually and all</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.37">these players the elite the</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="5.88">establishment the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="6.08">bankers they all knew that this was</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="6.03">going to happen the problem now is that</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="6.13">the plan is up in the air for the</text>
  <text start="494.66" dur="5.7">central bankers their system is crashing</text>
  <text start="497.54" dur="7.35">they can&amp;#39;t stop it they can prolong it</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="7.61">they can&amp;#39;t stop it Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="504.89" dur="6.42">they are pushing this to the extreme</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="4.96">they know they need to destroy the</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="3.84">central bank system if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="6.989">destroy the central bank system the</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="10.44">central bank will return they will come</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="7.471">back restart the system and control the</text>
  <text start="525.59" dur="4.31">world once again they control it right</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="5.55">now they tell governments what to do</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="6.01">when you put a government into debt they</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="4.59">can dictate to that country and say</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="3.78">listen you need to implement these</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="4.98">austerity laws you need to cut these</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="4.83">programs and what happens the people pay</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="5.13">for it the people enslave with taxes</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="5.4">then people are out in the cold with no</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="4.05">programs and it just gets worse and</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="4.02">worse and worse as time goes on and we</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="5.34">could see exactly what happens if you</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="6.38">try to transition out of a central bank</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="7.05">system without destroying it in the UK</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="4.87">they are trying to get out of the EU the</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="4.14">central bankers won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="6.54">them the plan they came up with was</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="5.49">really not a plan it&amp;#39;s all weighted</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="4.83">towards the EU and not towards the</text>
  <text start="573.71" dur="4.65">people it&amp;#39;s really not a brexit they did</text>
  <text start="576.56" dur="3.09">this on purpose because the central</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="3.03">bankers they&amp;#39;re never gonna let a</text>
  <text start="579.65" dur="4.65">country go they&amp;#39;re never gonna let their</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="3.95">system die and let it be blamed on them</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="3.9">if they can help it</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="6.64">so Trump of the Patriots their only</text>
  <text start="588.2" dur="7.2">course of action is to destroy the</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="4.71">entire system and blame it on them this</text>
  <text start="595.4" dur="3.12">is why we see Trump out there</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="5.03">contradicting the Fed saying if this</text>
  <text start="598.52" dur="6.15">goes down guess what they&amp;#39;re to blame</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="4.54">and he kept on pushing the interest rate</text>
  <text start="604.67" dur="3.69">saying well I wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="3.99">right now the Fed knows that we have</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="3">debt coming up soon the Fed knows if</text>
  <text start="610.25" dur="3.96">they keep raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="611.36" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s going to destroy the economy guess</text>
  <text start="614.21" dur="3.54">what the mainstream media they already</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="3.81">knew this they already knew that if the</text>
  <text start="617.75" dur="3.66">Fed raised the rates the system will</text>
  <text start="619.49" dur="4.38">come down because remember the plan was</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="4.44">Trump was gonna have this awful economy</text>
  <text start="623.87" dur="3.96">the Fed was going to raise rates the</text>
  <text start="625.85" dur="3.03">economy was then gonna crash and the</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="3.24">mainstream media was gonna turn around</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="3.96">and blame it all on Trump this way he</text>
  <text start="631.07" dur="3.8">can&amp;#39;t he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get elected</text>
  <text start="632.84" dur="5.34">in 2020 or maybe he would been ousted</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="6.85">halfway through his presidency but he</text>
  <text start="638.18" dur="7.13">turned the tables on them he used their</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="5.91">manipulation against them and now look</text>
  <text start="645.31" dur="4.33">the mainstream media is saying whoa slow</text>
  <text start="647.63" dur="3.03">down fed slow it down because we know</text>
  <text start="649.64" dur="2.64">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen if you keep raising</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="5.19">the rates the system&amp;#39;s gonna come down</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="6.12">the problem is the person inside the Fed</text>
  <text start="655.85" dur="4.38">is working with Trump who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
