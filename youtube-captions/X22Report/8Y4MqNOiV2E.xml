  <text start="76.299" dur="4.621">a battle going on between two sides and</text>
  <text start="78.909" dur="4.051">we understand that the economy is being</text>
  <text start="80.92" dur="3.69">pushed to the edge this is why we see</text>
  <text start="82.96" dur="3.63">the manipulation of the GDP numbers this</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="3.39">is why we see unemployment numbers this</text>
  <text start="86.59" dur="4.68">is why we see all of this looking</text>
  <text start="88" dur="5.61">fantastic there&amp;#39;s a reason for it the</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="4.98">push is to make the economy look as best</text>
  <text start="93.61" dur="4.289">as it possibly can because on the other</text>
  <text start="96.25" dur="4.74">side the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="97.899" dur="5.851">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="100.99" dur="6.659">blame this entire system that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="103.75" dur="5.94">collapse on the Trump administration and</text>
  <text start="107.649" dur="3.121">we&amp;#39;ve already seen articles where</text>
  <text start="109.69" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="110.77" dur="4.379">recession in 2020 they were expecting</text>
  <text start="112.6" dur="4.439">the system to come down before this and</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="3.81">they keep talking about how the tariffs</text>
  <text start="117.039" dur="4.14">are going to ruin the economy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.959" dur="5.131">all doing this on purpose they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.179" dur="4.711">projecting right now and we&amp;#39;ve heard cue</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="4.44">say this before that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="5.19">media and the rest of the financial pun</text>
  <text start="128.53" dur="4.89">ins and others like to project before</text>
  <text start="131.08" dur="4.26">they go ahead and they do something and</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="4.5">of course what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="5.06">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re trying to get the</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="5.22">central bank to raise the rates even</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="4.39">faster and of course what the central</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="3.629">bank is doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="4.35">stepping back now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="146.769" dur="4.951">information come out we know that retail</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.98">stores they&amp;#39;re having a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="5.58">yes they all have online presence they</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="4.77">all use online for their sales but</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re still in trouble and these are</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="6.03">are a lot of the expensive stores or</text>
  <text start="161.319" dur="5.851">stores that were charging top dollar for</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="4.44">their items they&amp;#39;re not discounted as</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="5.16">much as many of the other stores and we</text>
  <text start="169.36" dur="4.98">see stores that are popping up and that</text>
  <text start="172.33" dur="4.439">are taking up the space within these</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.979">strip malls these are discounted stores</text>
  <text start="176.769" dur="5.161">where they get products in from those</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="3.961">main stores and they see they sell them</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="3.809">at a cheaper price</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="3.45">so stores like JC Penney&amp;#39;s Sears and the</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="3.121">rest the</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="4.44">are failing especially the more</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="3.9">expensive stores like BCBG and the rest</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="3.629">where they&amp;#39;re not really discounted</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="4.039">stores they are failing now remember a</text>
  <text start="194.799" dur="3.27">lot of the other stores like TJ Maxx</text>
  <text start="196.799" dur="4.151">Ross</text>
  <text start="198.069" dur="4.89">Simon Marshalls these are the discount</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="4.71">stores that receive the apparel from</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="4.801">these other stores and discount them</text>
  <text start="205.66" dur="4.409">quite a bit so a lot of people can go to</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="4.65">these stores and get those outfits but</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="4.651">the prices they&amp;#39;re paying are a lot</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.98">cheaper and a lot of people gonna be</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="4.56">shopping at stores that are a lot</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="5.22">cheaper than the normal everyday</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="6.209">supermarket or you know other department</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="5.489">stores today we see Walmart they are</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="6.661">saying that their sales are the</text>
  <text start="228.099" dur="6.39">strongest in ten years and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="6.209">saying that everything looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="7.771">now the company reported us comp sales X</text>
  <text start="238.359" dur="6.72">fueled up by 4.5% more than double the</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="5.28">estimate of 2.2 percent and the</text>
  <text start="245.079" dur="5.071">strongest Walmart us come in more than</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="4.47">10 years and this was led by groceries</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="4.649">because we know a lot of the Walmart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="4.68">have grocery stores within the entire</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="4.53">store and a lot of it was due to</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="5.37">groceries because they sell groceries at</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="5.251">a much cheaper price the other is</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="5.94">apparel yes their clothing is much</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="6.86">cheaper than many other places and a lot</text>
  <text start="268" dur="6.66">of people now are shopping at these</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="5.949">inexpensive stores because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="5.879">afford to go to the more expensive</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="6.541">stores and we see this with the dollar</text>
  <text start="280.539" dur="6.541">store we also see five below popping up</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="5.7">in many areas now yes they said their</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="4.41">online sales they have increased and if</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="3.96">we look at their online sales we say</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re up by 40 percent year-on-year an</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="4.56">improvement to the first quarter which</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="6.06">was up 33% and the fourth quarter which</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="5.639">was up 23% yes online sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="5.19">going to gain overtime does it mean that</text>
  <text start="303.789" dur="5.551">it&amp;#39;s up 40% and all their businesses</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="4.709">going to online no it doesn&amp;#39;t so what</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now people are</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="3.87">shifting in where they&amp;#39;re spending their</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="2.759">money now remember they also had stores</text>
  <text start="315.039" dur="3.241">closed down</text>
  <text start="315.849" dur="4.381">we have many other stores closed down so</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.11">it there get there there are a few</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="4.11">fewer stores where people go shopping so</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s going to happen the sales at</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="4.5">these stores they&amp;#39;re going to increase</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="5.28">and this is really what we see happening</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="4.41">here and stores like Marshalls and</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="3.75">t.j.maxx and the rest you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="3.03">sales there increased because people</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="3.63">aren&amp;#39;t going to the more expensive</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.56">places they&amp;#39;re going to the discount</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="4.92">area and they&amp;#39;re getting the same exact</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="5.22">clothing we also see the Philly Fed</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="4.97">their survey has crashed</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="6">- Priya let pre-election Lowe&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="6.82">their headline crashed - 11.9 now this</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="7.35">is the lowest since November 2016 this</text>
  <text start="355.42" dur="6.6">missed expectations of 22 and it is</text>
  <text start="359.41" dur="4.2">completely completely the opposite of</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="4.29">what they thought was going to happen</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="6.18">same thing with housing starts they</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="6.9">collapsed 12.9% in June and they only</text>
  <text start="369.79" dur="5.88">rebounded in July - 0.9 percent now they</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="4.65">were expecting a balance of 7.4 percent</text>
  <text start="375.67" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re not seeing this happen now</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="8.43">remember June startup May May June July</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="7.23">August these are the strong months for</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="5.64">real estate and when you look at this it</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.28">looks like it is the weakest months for</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="6.21">real estate so this is a second month in</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="6.21">a row with a massive miss - economist</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="5.31">expectations housing starts are now down</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="4.59">year in year for the second month in a</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="3.78">row we see us home builder stocks</text>
  <text start="405.73" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve been tracking fundamentals</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="5.84">dramatically lower all year and we know</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="7.44">from existing home sales new home sales</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="6.58">real estate is not doing well u.s.</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="4.41">mortgage refinancing dropped to the</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="5.13">lowest since the turn of the century and</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="3.96">of course what we know and what we know</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="3.63">right now is that interest rates are</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="4.32">moving up and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="3.72">Mortgage Bankers Association so when we</text>
  <text start="430.45" dur="3.69">look at this we can see that the real</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="4.8">estate bubbles they are starting to pop</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="6.12">and it&amp;#39;s not just here in the US it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="5.81">around the world and we see the</text>
  <text start="440.26" dur="6.42">mainstream media they are out there and</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="9.1">they&amp;#39;re trying to put a spin on why the</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="6.5">Fed might lower rates now this is very</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="4.13">interesting</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="5.459">this is coming out of CNBC and it says</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="6.08">Trump might get his slowdown in rate</text>
  <text start="458.639" dur="6.631">hikes but for the wrong reasons</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="5.92">Trump&amp;#39;s trade wars could slow the</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="5.31">economy and thus caused the Federal</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="6.63">Reserve to pause in its current rate</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="5.52">hike cycle so already the corporate</text>
  <text start="474.6" dur="3.45">media and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and</text>
  <text start="476.1" dur="4.379">many other articles they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="5.399">projecting out there that the tariffs</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="5.97">and what Trump is doing with trade wars</text>
  <text start="483.449" dur="5.25">is going to slow the economy now of</text>
  <text start="486.449" dur="3.69">course as we know the economy is being</text>
  <text start="488.699" dur="3.301">manipulated right now to make it look</text>
  <text start="490.139" dur="3.9">like it&amp;#39;s doing fantastically the</text>
  <text start="492" dur="4.32">mainstream media they don&amp;#39;t have control</text>
  <text start="494.039" dur="4.56">over what is happening here neither</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="3.81">really does the Fed yes they can raise</text>
  <text start="498.599" dur="4.171">interest rates they can low interest</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="6">rates they can create currency they can</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="6.269">prop up the banks but the data is coming</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="4.68">from the government and it looks like</text>
  <text start="509.039" dur="4.771">what Trump is trying to do he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="5.07">to force the Federal Reserve to raise</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="3.81">the interest rates even though he said</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s not a good time to raise the</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="4.56">interest rates because we have debt</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="6.45">coming too but you do what you feel is</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="5.4">best now the Fed right now through the</text>
  <text start="525.81" dur="5.61">mainstream media is saying that they</text>
  <text start="527.58" dur="6.39">might slow the rate hikes because of</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="5.19">what Trump is doing with the trade wars</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="4.65">with tariffs so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to set it up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="5.909">trying to figure out a way where this</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="7.08">economy will break down while Trump is</text>
  <text start="544.529" dur="7.051">in as in office and this way they can</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="5.16">use the excuse of why they can stop</text>
  <text start="551.58" dur="4.08">raising the rates because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="4.53">want to raise the rates anymore right</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="4.799">now because what&amp;#39;s going to happen here</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="5.22">is the Fed is going to lose a narrative</text>
  <text start="560.459" dur="4.951">as they raise the rates the economy is</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="4.26">going to continually break down as they</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="4.53">unwind it&amp;#39;s going to continually break</text>
  <text start="567.42" dur="4.74">down Trump and the Patriots are going to</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="3.63">point the finger at the Fed as they keep</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="3.51">doing this because they&amp;#39;re gonna say hey</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="3.84">look the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="5.22">here look at our GDP numbers look at our</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="7.32">unemployment numbers incredible and we</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="5.6">have tariffs going right now and the Fed</text>
  <text start="584.73" dur="4.22">is raising rates and</text>
  <text start="586.49" dur="4.5">during the economy I said it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="588.95" dur="4.65">good time to do this you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.99" dur="5.099">coming from Trump and when the economy</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="3.84">starts to break down they can point the</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="4.771">finger right at the Fed and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="597.44" dur="6.68">want this to happen now we see that many</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="6.36">countries are dumping the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="5.77">Russia they have dumped a lot of</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="5.46">Treasuries but it&amp;#39;s not the only country</text>
  <text start="609.89" dur="7.94">we see China&amp;#39;s holdings of US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="612.68" dur="10.74">drop by 4.4 billion from 1183 billion to</text>
