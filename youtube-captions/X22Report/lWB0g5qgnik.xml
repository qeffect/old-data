  <text start="33.66" dur="4.56">title of this episode is governments are</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="5.119">strategically positioning themselves for</text>
  <text start="38.22" dur="7.62">the economic collapse and on friday</text>
  <text start="40.969" dur="8.261">reported on something that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="5.91">happen this fall or early winter where I</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="5.849">call it part 1 of the collapse and I</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="6.149">laid that out Saturday I talked about</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="6.901">the power grid drill that is going to</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="8.041">happen in November and now there is even</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="6.69">more news and more warnings that are</text>
  <text start="65.94" dur="7.2">coming out and certain things that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="6.96">make sense and this will just add to</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="6">what I&amp;#39;ve been saying and we will go</text>
  <text start="75.63" dur="5.73">through everything in this report but</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="4.979">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="7.439">news first and then we&amp;#39;ll get into what</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="8.341">I believe will happen during this fall</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="7.951">or early winter now spanish banks their</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="7.019">bad loan ratios are edging higher and it</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="6">really is not a surprise because when</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="6.17">you have people out of work people who</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="6.149">can&amp;#39;t make payments we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="5.47">more bad loans I mean it just all makes</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="5.15">sense and the more people who are</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="6.091">unemployed the worse it gets the more</text>
  <text start="114.049" dur="5.381">that you know governments and banks have</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="4.699">to try to borrow or do whatever they</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="6.329">have to do to survive and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="6.791">unsustainable it just cannot be done and</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="6.061">we see this as a perfect example of</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="5.61">Greece because that was test one let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.82" dur="4.919">try bailouts okay we did the first</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="4.83">bailout the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="4.261">government said everything&amp;#39;s fine but it</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="4.74">really wasn&amp;#39;t they needed</text>
  <text start="141" dur="5.55">multiple bailouts and every time they</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="5.85">get a bailout things get worse more</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="5.97">people get laid off more unemployment</text>
  <text start="149.73" dur="5.22">numbers go up and is just getting worse</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="5.49">and worse and worse so then they did</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="6.57">test number two let&amp;#39;s try let&amp;#39;s try this</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="6.75">in Cyprus instead of bail out let&amp;#39;s try</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="5.28">bail-ins well they froze everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="3.449">account they put everyone in capital</text>
  <text start="166.8" dur="3.48">controls where they can&amp;#39;t touch any of</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="3.331">their money for just two weeks they said</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="4.17">and we&amp;#39;re only going to take eight to</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="5.13">ten percent but of course as</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="4.68">government&amp;#39;s always do they lied and</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="4.98">they took forty seven percent and guess</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="4.829">what people are still under capital</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="6.72">controls over a hundred and twenty days</text>
  <text start="183.959" dur="9.271">now so bailout didn&amp;#39;t work Baylen didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="7.14">work so it these two tests they realize</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="4.56">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter where they take the</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="5.13">money because if you don&amp;#39;t have revenue</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.84">coming in you can&amp;#39;t support the system</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="7.68">and as more and more people lose work it</text>
  <text start="204.63" dur="6.53">gets worse and worse and worse and I</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="5.639">mean we&amp;#39;re seeing this here in the US</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="5.56">now Sachs is reporting weak</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="5.941">second-quarter sales they have deeper</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="4.799">losses and this says Saks Inc on monday</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="3.96">reported a deeper than expected</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="4.621">second-quarter loss after disappointing</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="4.11">sales on shoes and handbags and it</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.08">forced them it forced the luxury</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="4.98">retailer to mark down their prices</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="4.859">because even the wealthier people are</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="5.039">having a tough time affording these</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="4.801">expensive shoes and bags and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="3.151">seeing this not just happen in the</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="3.329">wealthy sector we&amp;#39;re seeing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="5.87">starting to happen all over the place</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="8.941">we&amp;#39;re seeing in macys Nordstrom&amp;#39;s Cole&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="8.43">Walmart Costco office masks or officemax</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="8.25">and we&amp;#39;re seeing all of these stores</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="8.11">report slower sales we&amp;#39;re even seeing</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="7.639">more sales stores report that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="7.679">actually closing stores best best buy</text>
  <text start="268.039" dur="6.281">barnes and noble radioshack well JC</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="3.631">Penney we know that just a disaster that</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="2.189">just</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="5.04">that store is just going bye-bye and</text>
  <text start="276.509" dur="7.771">we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen all over the</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="7.049">place and from all of this I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="5.699">seeing it&amp;#39;s the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="286.949" dur="6.541">entire country and especially the middle</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="6.06">class and just some statistics about</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="4.109">this is seventy percent seventy-six</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="4.081">percent of Americans live paycheck to</text>
  <text start="297.599" dur="4.731">paycheck twenty-seven percent of</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="4.59">American have no savings at all</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="4.72">forty-six percent of Americans have less</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="6.54">than eight hundred dollars in savings</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="9">right now and most Americans right now</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="7.889">are working as temps and or have more</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="6.26">than one job just to make ends meet</text>
  <text start="319.139" dur="5.37">especially with food getting pricier</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="4.329">products shrinking down so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="4.201">getting less for your money and this way</text>
  <text start="326.639" dur="4.08">the manufacturers don&amp;#39;t have to show</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="3.569">that the prices are actually going up so</text>
  <text start="330.719" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re just making things smaller and</text>
  <text start="332.279" dur="4.741">but for those things that they you know</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="5.881">like milk they can&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s a gallon</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="4.319">because you know and try to shrink it</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="2.639">and still say it&amp;#39;s a gallon so they</text>
  <text start="341.339" dur="3.931">leave it as a gamble but see the price</text>
  <text start="342.719" dur="5.13">of milk going up I mean it&amp;#39;s already up</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="3.959">where I am at three dots 89 cents I know</text>
  <text start="347.849" dur="5.401">you can get a cheaper in other places</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="7.5">but the place I&amp;#39;m tracking it has it at</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="6.15">389 last month it was 385 before that I</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="7.261">think I had a 379 so the price is</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="8.639">continually going up up up okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="7.53">move on here now the US military depends</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="6.66">on Egypt and a lot of congressmen are</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="5.85">saying let&amp;#39;s cut aid to Egypt and do I</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="6.18">believe that&amp;#39;s going to happen no they</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.579">need Egypt they control Egypt they</text>
  <text start="380.879" dur="4.051">control Saudi Arabia that control most</text>
  <text start="382.949" dur="4.261">of the Middle East countries they are</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="4.65">there in place to protect the US dollar</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="4.53">as a reserve currency and the private</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.989">western central banks and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="6.57">not going to cut off aid to Egypt and</text>
  <text start="395.569" dur="5.171">this report says the US military is</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="4.77">heavily dependent on Egypt to move</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="4.969">personnel and equipment to Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="4.649">and around volatile parts of Middle East</text>
  <text start="405.709" dur="2.871">complicating US efforts to place</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="2.951">pressure on</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.1">in military in the wake of its violent</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="5.94">crackdown on protesters Egypt has been a</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="7.62">cornerstone for the US military presence</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="7.259">in the middle east and about 35 to 45</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="5.209">u.s. Fifth Fleet naval ships pass</text>
  <text start="423.879" dur="6.271">through passed through the Suez Canal</text>
  <text start="426.509" dur="7.75">annually including Carrier Strike groups</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="7.229">and most of the time Egypt has allowed</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="6.03">us warships to be expedited which</text>
  <text start="437.379" dur="4.59">orphans means they get ahead of other</text>
  <text start="440.289" dur="4.261">ships and they&amp;#39;re allowed to pass</text>
  <text start="441.969" dur="6.45">through why because the US government</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.03">controls Egypt when you give a country</text>
  <text start="448.419" dur="4.62">billions of dollars they&amp;#39;ll do whatever</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="6.63">you want them to do just like Saudi</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="6.451">Arabia and this goes on to say if Egypt</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="5.28">cut off its airspace and canal access</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="7.139">the US military would face heavier costs</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="6.69">and not just that they control the</text>
  <text start="466.629" dur="6.241">military they give them aid and they</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="7.41">protect the US dollar the oil the</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="7.409">private western central bank from being</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="6.09">overrun and being done to it like what</text>
  <text start="480.279" dur="7.32">Iran and Syria has done where they do</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="9.269">not trade in the u.s. dollar now Syria</text>
  <text start="487.599" dur="7.31">warns of new advances by al-qaeda and</text>
  <text start="491.949" dur="7.381">we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot about al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="494.909" dur="7.091">pushing and going into other areas like</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="6.139">Beirut and bombing there to bring the</text>
  <text start="502" dur="8.58">fight back to Syria and we see that</text>
  <text start="505.469" dur="8.32">al-qaeda is moving into Syria it seems</text>
  <text start="510.58" dur="6.089">like it&amp;#39;s trying to get things going</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="8.16">inside Syria with more people coming in</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="7.441">and many of the camp&amp;#39;s residents that</text>
  <text start="521.949" dur="4.621">where al-qaeda is coming in we&amp;#39;re forced</text>
  <text start="524.11" dur="7.8">to flee to a neighboring Palestine camp</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="7.65">when hostilities took place and some of</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="5.1">these al-qaeda are starting to preach</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="6.3">their versions of the Quran and at some</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="5.1">point they&amp;#39;re gentle teachings become</text>
  <text start="540.52" dur="3.72">more aggressive</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="4.59">it gets out of hand and it seems like</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="4.74">this al Qaeda presence all throughout</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="4.65">the Middle East of course we know that</text>
  <text start="548.98" dur="5.31">the US government had a terrorist threat</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="8.549">about al-qaeda and as we know al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="8.43">is a CIA paid group and so we pay al</text>
  <text start="559.899" dur="4.68">Qaeda to be terrorists well I should say</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="5.7">the US government central bankers CIA</text>
  <text start="564.579" dur="6.301">pay al Qaeda to be terrorists and then</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="3.84">we put a report up there that we need to</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="5.1">be afraid of these people that were</text>
  <text start="572.26" dur="5.639">paying to do this does it make sense no</text>
  <text start="575.98" dur="3.27">of course it doesn&amp;#39;t but for those</text>
  <text start="577.899" dur="4.141">people who don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="6.839">on they think al Qaeda are real</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="6.799">terrorists now what is happening all</text>

  <text start="989.11" dur="4.649">it is the reason why the oversight is</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="4.199">inadequate because we have to think</text>

  <text start="1075.299" dur="7.091">the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="1078.06" dur="7.42">now way back when the Boston bombing</text>
  <text start="1082.39" dur="5.67">happened the DHS had a kill switch which</text>
  <text start="1085.48" dur="4.59">killed the cell towers and didn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="1088.06" dur="5.58">people to communicate with each other</text>
  <text start="1090.07" dur="8.4">and back then there was an article about</text>
  <text start="1093.64" dur="7.38">a a kill switch and what the DHS didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1098.47" dur="4.35">realize is that people could still take</text>
  <text start="1101.02" dur="5.04">pictures with their phone and when the</text>
  <text start="1102.82" dur="5.97">cell towers turned on they were able to</text>
  <text start="1106.06" dur="6.57">transmit these pictures which kind of</text>
  <text start="1108.79" dur="6.99">messed up their entire false flag event</text>
  <text start="1112.63" dur="5.43">and just to bring this up recently there</text>
  <text start="1115.78" dur="7.4">was an article that talked about the</text>
  <text start="1118.06" dur="7.95">Texas fertilizer plant and the the</text>
  <text start="1123.18" dur="5.65">explosion that caused the fertilizer</text>
  <text start="1126.01" dur="5.22">plant to go up was external that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1128.83" dur="5.79">the new report says and I had a video</text>
  <text start="1131.23" dur="5.73">that actually you heard a missile hit</text>
  <text start="1134.62" dur="4.47">the fertilizer plant because what was</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="4.05">happening is everyone was taking</text>
  <text start="1139.09" dur="4.83">pictures at the time of the Boston</text>
  <text start="1141.01" dur="8.9">bombing transmitting it all around it</text>
  <text start="1143.92" dur="9.42">messed up their original story of a gun</text>
  <text start="1149.91" dur="6.79">extremist gun-loving extremists because</text>
  <text start="1153.34" dur="5.91">the gun bill was being voted on at the</text>
  <text start="1156.7" dur="6.18">same exact time that&amp;#39;s why it was a</text>

  <text start="1162.88" dur="4.65">distraction for one day fertilizer plant</text>
  <text start="1165.52" dur="4.71">blew up that was plastered all over the</text>
  <text start="1167.53" dur="4.59">news for one day the next day it was</text>
  <text start="1170.23" dur="5.79">back to the Boston bombing they had a</text>
  <text start="1172.12" dur="7.92">whole new story about Muslims al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1176.02" dur="7.59">and everything else to bring that story</text>
  <text start="1180.04" dur="6.81">back in and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="1183.61" dur="6.89">Apple has just filed a patent that will</text>
  <text start="1186.85" dur="8.85">allow the phone to be turned off</text>
  <text start="1190.5" dur="7.45">completely if the DHS needs to do it it</text>
  <text start="1195.7" dur="4.62">will not only be Apple phones it will be</text>
  <text start="1197.95" dur="4.22">every single phone this way they will</text>
  <text start="1200.32" dur="5.22">stop everyone from not just</text>
  <text start="1202.17" dur="7.81">communicating but taking pictures and</text>
  <text start="1205.54" dur="8.46">having these problems I said this before</text>
  <text start="1209.98" dur="7.74">central bankers government need to do</text>
  <text start="1214" dur="5.79">two things they need to have the control</text>
  <text start="1217.72" dur="5.19">of the creation of money which they do</text>
  <text start="1219.79" dur="5.7">and they need the control of the flow of</text>
  <text start="1222.91" dur="5.22">information which they do on the</text>
  <text start="1225.49" dur="6.12">mainstream media level but the internet</text>
  <text start="1228.13" dur="5.7">and these smartphones they do not and</text>
  <text start="1231.61" dur="4.17">they are trying to crack down on this</text>
  <text start="1233.83" dur="4.08">and that&amp;#39;s why you see sista still</text>
  <text start="1235.78" dur="6.08">pending in the Senate you see other laws</text>
  <text start="1237.91" dur="8.43">that are pending to all crack down and</text>
  <text start="1241.86" dur="7.93">eventually remove the alternative media</text>
  <text start="1246.34" dur="6.27">remove the people&amp;#39;s ability to take</text>
  <text start="1249.79" dur="4.68">pictures and this is why this is</text>
  <text start="1252.61" dur="4.68">happening because they need control of</text>
  <text start="1254.47" dur="7.02">the internet and your smartphone to</text>
  <text start="1257.29" dur="8.4">complete the full control of everything</text>
  <text start="1261.49" dur="7.439">and right now they do not have it now I</text>
  <text start="1265.69" dur="6.57">wanted to get into what is going to</text>
  <text start="1268.929" dur="8.041">happen again in this fall early winter</text>
  <text start="1272.26" dur="8.09">now we understand the Fed has just</text>
  <text start="1276.97" dur="8.85">reached the two trillion dollars of</text>

  <text start="1285.82" dur="8.82">this says here is that they in was it</text>
  <text start="1291.01" dur="6.87">August seventh they own 1.99 trillion</text>
