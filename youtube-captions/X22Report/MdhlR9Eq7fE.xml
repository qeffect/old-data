  <text start="128.209" dur="4.621">it&amp;#39;s gonna cost a lot more money but we</text>
  <text start="131.239" dur="3.931">need to go backwards in time a little</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="5.94">bit to understand where net neutrality</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="6.36">came from and who created it and who</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="5.579">coined the term and brought us down this</text>
  <text start="141.53" dur="5.58">path to make us think they were the way</text>
  <text start="144.349" dur="6.451">they wanted us to think now back in 2015</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="7.11">when a cheap I was writing his dissent</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="5.84">opinion against the FCC to 1524 formerly</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="5.159">known as the report in order on remand</text>
  <text start="156.64" dur="4.66">decla Tory ruling an order in the matter</text>
  <text start="159.379" dur="4.951">of protecting and promoting the open</text>
  <text start="161.3" dur="7.17">Internet but it&amp;#39;s referred to referred</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="5.909">to as net neutrality we need to</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="6">understand what was happening at that</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="6.631">time and 8 pi said something very</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="4.439">interesting back then he said this is</text>
  <text start="176.87" dur="5.16">not only a radical departure from the</text>
  <text start="178.909" dur="4.801">bipartisan market-oriented policies that</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="2.34">have served us so well for the last two</text>
  <text start="183.71" dur="2.73">decades</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="4.35">it is also an about-face</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="5.76">the proposals the FCC made just last May</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="6">so why is the FCC changing course why is</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="4.74">the FCC turning its back on Internet</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="4.8">freedom is it because we now have</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="5.73">evidence that the Internet is not open</text>
  <text start="199.52" dur="5.31">no is it because we have discovered some</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="5.25">problem with our prior interpretation of</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="5.97">the law no we are flip-flopping from one</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="7.92">reason and one reason alone President</text>
  <text start="210.8" dur="8.4">Obama told us to do so now let&amp;#39;s dig a</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="8.31">little bit deeper here the main reason</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="10.97">why this is called net neutrality it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="11.91">because Obama ordered it who funded this</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="9.94">well George Soros George Soros put up</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="6.29">billions of dollars to push this what</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="6.12">other organizations push this Google</text>
  <text start="242.35" dur="7.84">Microsoft Facebook Twitter Amazon now</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="8.31">why did they push it why did they say we</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="6.99">need net neutrality because it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="254.54" dur="9.75">affect them had nothing to do with them</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="11.28">it affected the ISP providers now why in</text>
  <text start="264.29" dur="4.92">the world would they care about this why</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="3.9">would Obama</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="7.29">why would Soros push all of this well</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="6.33">Google has a vested interest the tech</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="4.53">giant helped write the 2015 net</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="3.78">neutrality rules and Google employees</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="4.77">had more access to the White House</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="8.4">during Obama&amp;#39;s term than did anyone else</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="8.52">and this was all crafted by Obama Soros</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="6.09">and these companies to regulate the</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="6.02">internet under title 2 specifications</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="6.84">that defined Internet service providers</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="6.28">companies like Comcast Verizon AT&amp;amp;T that</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="4.59">plug you into the Internet to be bound</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="5.31">by net neutrality</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="4.95">the rules of net neutrality demanding</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="4.35">that the Internet service providers</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="4.8">treat all edge providers equally but</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="3.689">since the giant providers companies like</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="4.829">Google Facebook and Twitter are</text>
  <text start="319.969" dur="6.48">content providers they are exempt from</text>
  <text start="322.969" dur="5.31">net neutrality rules free to restrain</text>
  <text start="326.449" dur="4.47">content by censoring out all</text>
  <text start="328.279" dur="4.02">conservative or libertarian views at</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="3.6">will or anyone else that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.299" dur="5.64">agree with just by changing the Terms of</text>
  <text start="334.519" dur="6.06">Service and they don&amp;#39;t have to explain</text>
  <text start="337.939" dur="5.61">why they&amp;#39;re doing this they just go</text>
  <text start="340.579" dur="6.63">ahead and they ban net neutrality rules</text>
  <text start="343.549" dur="6.63">was written by the Soros funded tech</text>
  <text start="347.209" dur="5.91">left coalition and it would only apply</text>
  <text start="350.179" dur="5.91">to Internet services providers because</text>
  <text start="353.119" dur="4.86">under title 2 only these ISPs not the</text>
  <text start="356.089" dur="4.11">giant edge providers are considered</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.44">common carriers defined under the</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="4.98">Federal Communications Act that was</text>
  <text start="362.419" dur="6.691">passed about like eighty-three years ago</text>
  <text start="365.179" dur="6.87">or so so the giant edge providers under</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="5.039">net neutrality elevate themselves to the</text>
  <text start="372.049" dur="4.68">new dimension of Internet in ferment</text>
  <text start="374.149" dur="8.1">information providers that live in a</text>
  <text start="376.729" dur="8.9">realm above the ISP common carrier so</text>
  <text start="382.249" dur="7.861">what they&amp;#39;ve done is they use their</text>
  <text start="385.629" dur="7.75">neuro-linguistic language wordplay to</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="6.839">convince you that and they used the term</text>
  <text start="393.379" dur="6.35">net neutrality is free internet and it</text>
  <text start="396.949" dur="5.25">keeps all the lanes open for everyone</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="5.05">where else have they done this before</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="5.46">where they use terms where they actually</text>
  <text start="404.779" dur="6.39">mean the opposite the Affordable Care</text>
  <text start="407.659" dur="5.04">Act which makes health care less</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="5.57">affordable that&amp;#39;s why they put the word</text>
  <text start="412.699" dur="7.26">affordable in there has it done that no</text>
  <text start="416.739" dur="8.47">common core which is the common core of</text>
  <text start="419.959" dur="6.69">learning did that help the education of</text>
  <text start="425.209" dur="4.68">our children</text>
  <text start="426.649" dur="7.64">no it lowers the education to the lowest</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="7.65">common denominator global food security</text>
  <text start="434.289" dur="8.34">which ironically increased world hunger</text>
  <text start="437.539" dur="7.92">the USA Freedom Act which basically</text>
  <text start="442.629" dur="6.94">removes our freedom and liberty for all</text>
  <text start="445.459" dur="6.781">Americans the Patriot Act all of these</text>
  <text start="449.569" dur="3.861">things do the opposite of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="3.59">telling us</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="5.549">and net neutrality gives the US federal</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="7.5">government the power to choose winners</text>
  <text start="458.979" dur="7.741">and losers the power to control the</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="7.47">internet because think about it before</text>
  <text start="466.72" dur="5.4">net neutrality were there problems no</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;ve already discussed that there were</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="7.019">no problems whatsoever they made these</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="6.24">things up to convince you they made up</text>
  <text start="479.139" dur="5.431">the term they sat around a table how can</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="5.07">we convince the people that we need to</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="5.58">do this and what they do is they tell</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="5.609">you one thing while in the background</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="4.26">these laws were being placed for</text>
  <text start="492.669" dur="4.861">something else and that was censorship</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s really what it&amp;#39;s all about we see</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="7.35">nikki Haley out there and she is</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="7.8">attempting to deceive the world into</text>
  <text start="504.88" dur="7.11">thinking that the Iranians have violated</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="7.89">their nuclear deal that there are</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="6.39">funding the Hootie&amp;#39;s in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="516.07" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re firing missiles into Saudi</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="4.14">Arabia now of course the missile came</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="4.98">from Saudi Arabia and she&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="4.74">presenting it showing the evidence of</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="5.6">this rusted old missile system and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="6.15">saying that yes we have the evidence</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="6.549">well she kind of left out a couple of</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="5.1">things because the panel found out that</text>
  <text start="536.709" dur="3.061">the missile was a modification of type</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="3.78">that came from North Korea</text>
  <text start="539.77" dur="4.89">both Yemen and Iran have bought and</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.79">modified the same missile type which has</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.61">been conveniently ignored by the</text>
  <text start="547.08" dur="5.35">corporate media and they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="5.4">tell you that part of it so do you</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="5.76">really think that the US and the weapon</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="6.18">systems of the US are not in the hands</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="6.21">of other groups they didn&amp;#39;t make their</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="6.6">way components and things like that into</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="6.48">other areas of course they have and Iran</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="4.35">is out there saying well this is kind of</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="4.32">very difficult for us to continually</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="6.09">supply these weapons because Saudi</text>
  <text start="575.2" dur="7.74">Arabia has has had a two-year blockade</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="8.28">on Yemen make me impossible for Iran to</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="7.32">even get anything into a into Yemen</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="5.46">they forgot to mention that part two so</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="5.879">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="7.86">making a last-ditch effort to convince</text>
  <text start="596.139" dur="7.291">everyone that Iran is a huge threat Iran</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="5.7">is breaking the nuclear deal Iran is</text>
  <text start="603.43" dur="4.68">supplying weaponry actually the opposite</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="3.839">is actually happening the Cabal is a</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="4.589">threat to the world the Cabal has been</text>
  <text start="610.029" dur="5.401">supplying weapons to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="612.699" dur="5.07">al-qaeda the moderate rebels supplying</text>

  <text start="638.56" dur="5.37">supplying weapons to all of these</text>
  <text start="640.63" dur="8.28">different groups and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="8.13">is they&amp;#39;re trying to create chaos in the</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="5.369">corporate media in the world to try to</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="5.31">distract everyone from what is really</text>
  <text start="654.279" dur="5.49">going on here and the truth is coming</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="3.839">out and they don&amp;#39;t like it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="659.769" dur="3.591">running out of time and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="661.209" dur="6.63">more chaos it&amp;#39;s gonna get a lot worse</text>
  <text start="663.36" dur="6.909">because they realize they are stuck here</text>
  <text start="667.839" dur="5.641">and they need to do something very very</text>
  <text start="670.269" dur="6.121">fast before the whole thing comes down</text>
  <text start="673.48" dur="5.64">around them we see there was an incident</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="4.37">involving a Russian and US aircraft that</text>
  <text start="679.12" dur="4.709">was taking place in the Syrian airspace</text>
  <text start="680.76" dur="8.05">east of the Euphrates River now it was</text>
  <text start="683.829" dur="7.801">two f-22s and two su-25s and they were</text>
  <text start="688.81" dur="4.56">flying very close to each other and all</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="3.99">of a sudden you have 22 fighter aircraft</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="4.35">fired warning flares to chase the</text>
  <text start="695.62" dur="3.87">Russian su-25 jets away from the Aires</text>
  <text start="697.72" dur="4.859">airspace over the so-called</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="6.12">deconfliction zone that was agreed upon</text>
  <text start="702.579" dur="4.981">by Washington and Moscow and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.61" dur="4.289">saying that this happens quite often</text>
  <text start="707.56" dur="4.8">where sometimes this happens and they</text>
  <text start="709.899" dur="4.17">use the deconfliction channels and they</text>
  <text start="712.36" dur="3.81">talk to each other to talk about what is</text>
  <text start="714.069" dur="3.781">happening now the Russian Defense</text>

  <text start="725.829" dur="4.92">humanitarian aid convoy now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="729.609" dur="4.41">about this for a second</text>
  <text start="730.749" dur="7.41">the United States is flying around</text>
