  <text start="47.82" dur="5.46">Greece and the ECB there&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="4.86">having meetings discussing the debt</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.5">problem and we can see that Greece does</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="4.11">not want to pay all of the stet they</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="3.57">want to write some of it off to help the</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="3.48">people in the country now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="6.33">dealing with Russia they&amp;#39;re meeting with</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="8.1">Russia and they&amp;#39;re looking to maybe exit</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="6.75">the eurozone at this point and Greek</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="4.739">Prime Minister Alexis tsipras warned</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="4.65">German Chancellor Angela Merkel on</text>

  <text start="94.89" dur="4.89">of economic reforms given that Greece</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.261">has no access to money markets and also</text>

  <text start="101.31" dur="4.53">repayment obligations during the spring</text>

  <text start="105.84" dur="4.889">ECB special restrictions when combined</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="5.851">with the disbursement delays would make</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="6.691">it impossible for any government to</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="6.57">service its debt and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="6.809">tsipras and I have to agree the ECB is</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.82">making it very very difficult and as we</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="5.7">can see throughout the eurozone with</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="4.889">France and Italy Portugal Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="3.511">are continually making it very difficult</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="3.811">from every for every soon</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.25">one of these countries because these</text>
  <text start="135.27" dur="6.6">countries are placing or imposing</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="6.09">austerity on their people and every time</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="5.79">they get a tranche of more and more debt</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="5.13">none of this money goes to the people</text>
  <text start="147.66" dur="4.83">whatsoever it goes directly to the</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="5.91">banking system and it bypasses the</text>
  <text start="152.49" dur="6.75">people so all this debt and all these</text>
  <text start="155.82" dur="5.45">additional loans don&amp;#39;t help the people</text>
  <text start="159.24" dur="5.55">whatsoever actually the people are</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="6.13">suffering from all of this and it is</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.74">impossible to sustain this debt and to</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="2.97">pay it back I mean the United States has</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="2.52">a little something a little bit</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.8">different here they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="172.05" dur="5.79">continually create money but again all</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.22">this creation of all this money is not</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="4.74">helping the people whatsoever look at</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="3.36">Detroit look at the many cities here in</text>

  <text start="186.24" dur="3.45">on there is no money coming back into</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="5.34">the United States most of the money is</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="8.46">now going out to other nations or to pay</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="9.24">for war and to order new military assets</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="6.96">to help push the next war to cover up</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="6.029">this entire collapse now here in the</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="7.11">United States we see that the entire</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="5.971">economy is imploding and each day we</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="4.95">report on this things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="4.32">and worse they&amp;#39;re not improving like</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="5.33">they continually say I remember back in</text>
  <text start="219" dur="6.12">August of 2013 when they told us the</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="5.19">real estate industry was completely</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="5.76">recovering we&amp;#39;re on the road to a</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="6.18">fantastic recovery I mean Obama was even</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="7.92">out there giving a speech in Phoenix and</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="7.24">since that time we have seen absolutely</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="5.1">no recovery no we&amp;#39;ve seen we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="5.55">bubbles being inflated we see an</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="5.27">illusionary real estate market which</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="7.049">cannot be sustained we have seen</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="6.7">draconian programs being implemented to</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="5.011">bring more and more of the subprime</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="6.33">people in to continually push this</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="6.93">bubble larger and larger but we have not</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="4.939">seen an improvement actually all we see</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="5.169">are things that</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="8.971">are getting worse in real estate in</text>
  <text start="270.819" dur="8.68">retail in the unemployment situation and</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="6.089">we can see as we go forward even with</text>
  <text start="279.499" dur="6.23">these new programs it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="6.291">getting worse I mean following January&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.729" dur="5.68">disasters dive in existing home sales</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="5.5">februari saw a four-month of missed</text>
  <text start="291.409" dur="6.171">expectations with about four point eight</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="6.329">eight million print against a 4.9</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="5.28">perhaps more worrisome is the national</text>
  <text start="300.319" dur="5.641">association of realtors larry uh noting</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="6.51">unsuitable price levels as a reason for</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.699">weak sales due to low inventories well</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="4.84">inventories have been going up in</text>
  <text start="311.659" dur="5.97">February they increased by one point six</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.31">percent well of course what they do is</text>
  <text start="317.629" dur="4.111">they blame it on the weather they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="5.479">blame it on many other things and when I</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="6.69">look around the country I definitely see</text>
  <text start="324.999" dur="5.41">prices continually coming down I see</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="4.409">many people who have their homes on the</text>
  <text start="330.409" dur="3.93">market reducing their prices they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="332.839" dur="4.621">getting the traffic that they used to</text>
  <text start="334.339" dur="6.061">get to and we saw this back in 2007</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="4.709">going into 2008 where traffic all of a</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="3.09">sudden dried up all these people were</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="2.881">selling their homes a lot of people</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="3.51">decided to take their homes off the</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="3.78">market but other people decided to</text>
  <text start="347" dur="3.81">continually try to sell it and they had</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="4.5">to continually reduce and reduce and</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="4.829">reduce define that area where people</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="3.899">would actually pay for that house and</text>
  <text start="355.639" dur="4.411">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing happen right</text>
  <text start="357.229" dur="5.731">now and again we have to remember all of</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="4.709">this was built up on the fed giving easy</text>
  <text start="362.96" dur="4.139">money to investment companies hedge</text>
  <text start="364.759" dur="5.94">funds and they&amp;#39;re the ones who paid cash</text>
  <text start="367.099" dur="7.011">for all these homes to push and to pump</text>
  <text start="370.699" dur="8.25">up this bubble their plan was to</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="5.919">basically pump up the bubble make people</text>
  <text start="378.949" dur="3.27">believe that the real estate market</text>
  <text start="380.029" dur="4.41">wasn&amp;#39;t proven that we were in this</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="4.2">recovery prices were going up because of</text>
  <text start="384.439" dur="4.2">course the banks were told to hold back</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="4.411">on all the clip foreclosures those</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="4.411">investment companies hedge funds that</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="5.04">were purchasing the houses in cash were</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="4.26">set we&amp;#39;re told not to sell them but to</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="3.479">keep them try to rent them out if they</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="3.18">could and they&amp;#39;re hoping that people</text>
  <text start="399.349" dur="3.201">would just fly</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="4.89">to the real estate market once again and</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="4.959">purchase these homes but this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="4.68">happen whatsoever and now we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="407.509" dur="5.88">to see that this cannot be sustained it</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="4.71">cannot be maintained for much much</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="3.721">longer and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="4.88">these new programs with zero percent</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="5.61">down will pay for your closing costs and</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="4.989">again it is not working out at this</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="4.11">point the American people are tapped out</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="3.661">the unemployment rate is much much worse</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="3.929">than they&amp;#39;re talking about it is not</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="5.269">five point five percent we&amp;#39;re closer to</text>
  <text start="430.759" dur="6.301">thirty percent and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="433.569" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re doing this to keep everyone in</text>
  <text start="437.06" dur="5.97">the dark and keep everyone convinced</text>
  <text start="439.009" dur="6.331">that everything is fine until the very</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="4.59">last minute where they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="445.34" dur="4.38">another country or group and they can</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="4.769">say see we brought you in this week we</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="4.89">brought you we brought this recovery to</text>
  <text start="452.389" dur="5.31">every single one of you we did what we</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="5.67">had to do and this ugh this country this</text>
  <text start="457.699" dur="4.381">other group or whoever brought the</text>
  <text start="460.28" dur="4.229">system down of course it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="4.769">Russia China the Islamic state Syria</text>
  <text start="464.509" dur="5.19">Iran Brazil Venezuela you name it the</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="5.31">players are always the same and we can</text>
  <text start="469.699" dur="4.051">see through manufacturing and from</text>
  <text start="472.159" dur="3.211">retail that things are not getting</text>
  <text start="473.75" dur="4.169">better i mean the Baltic Dry Index is</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="5.639">around 594 points right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.919" dur="4.68">creeping up a little bit but we have to</text>
  <text start="481.009" dur="5.4">remember if we look back one year ago</text>
  <text start="482.599" dur="7.681">when unemployment was higher where that</text>
  <text start="486.409" dur="6.391">means um people were out of work because</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re telling us now that Oh most of</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="3.119">America is back to work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.479" dur="3.481">working fine this is why all these</text>
  <text start="495.919" dur="5.731">stores are closing this is why people</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="8.48">being laid off the Baltic Dry Index back</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="7.44">in that time March 23rd 2014 was at 1578</text>
  <text start="506.44" dur="5.379">does this make any sense to anybody</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="4.41">because if it was true that everything</text>
  <text start="511.819" dur="3.66">was fine and we&amp;#39;re really at five point</text>
  <text start="513.5" dur="3.899">five percent we would see retail</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="5.19">expanding we would see people saying aha</text>
  <text start="517.399" dur="6.51">I feel secure my job I can go out and I</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="6.031">can purchase a home a car I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="523.909" dur="4.201">get that HDTV I&amp;#39;m gonna go get that</text>

  <text start="528.11" dur="4.469">computer but we&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="3.63">whatsoever and since people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.579" dur="5.281">purchasing</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="5.849">the factory orders are not there they</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t need the raw materials to create</text>
  <text start="539.959" dur="5.091">the products to sell in the stores and</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="6.33">this is why a lot of retail outlets are</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="6.25">closing or limiting the amount of stores</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="5.61">and laying off thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="5.219">of people I mean we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="5.4">and this is coming from the Chicago Fed</text>

  <text start="1067.08" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a success but when we take a</text>
  <text start="1069.659" dur="5.87">closer look it reveals that it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1071.73" dur="6.09">nearly as successful as anticipated</text>
  <text start="1075.529" dur="4.63">according to the survey fifty-seven</text>
  <text start="1077.82" dur="5.55">percent of the uninsured said the</text>
  <text start="1080.159" dur="6.27">penalty is less expensive for them than</text>

  <text start="1093.21" dur="5.88">because it&amp;#39;s cheaper so when we look at</text>
  <text start="1096.33" dur="6.809">this we see that you know what the</text>
  <text start="1099.09" dur="8.939">Affordable Care Act is too expensive for</text>
  <text start="1103.139" dur="6.931">people to get into it and right now</text>
  <text start="1108.029" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re saying listen it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1110.07" dur="4.349">matter at this point because I&amp;#39;m stuck</text>
  <text start="1111.659" dur="5.37">in the same situation if I truly wanted</text>
  <text start="1114.419" dur="4.681">health insurance I didn&amp;#39;t need Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1117.029" dur="4.711">I would have gotten it on my own but it</text>
  <text start="1119.1" dur="4.35">was expensive now that there&amp;#39;s Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1121.74" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s still expensive but now I have to</text>
  <text start="1123.45" dur="4.56">pay a penalty so it really didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="1125.61" dur="4.62">all those people stuck in the middle</text>
  <text start="1128.01" dur="6.149">here who weren&amp;#39;t getting the subsidies</text>
  <text start="1130.23" dur="8.37">and we can see right now that all of</text>
  <text start="1134.159" dur="6.331">these people who are our of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1138.6" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re just taking the tax penalty</text>
  <text start="1140.49" dur="4.439">because it&amp;#39;s a lot less money than</text>
  <text start="1142.59" dur="7.77">paying five six seven hundred dollars a</text>
