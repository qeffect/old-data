  <text start="82.78" dur="6.659">that ISIL and Isis they were funded by</text>

  <text start="118.75" dur="6.45">is about to occur and we already see</text>
  <text start="121.63" dur="6.81">that they&amp;#39;re linking Syria with Iraq</text>

  <text start="135.31" dur="4.79">get this terrorist group and of course</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="5.12">they&amp;#39;re using the propaganda of Seoul</text>
  <text start="140.1" dur="4.56">Media to sell the entire thing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="4.47">trying to convince us that this</text>

  <text start="155.19" dur="4.56">something like this this is a propaganda</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="4.02">stunt from the United States government</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="5.46">to convince the American people that</text>
  <text start="161.82" dur="5.4">this group is a danger too here in the</text>
  <text start="165.21" dur="3.51">United States and in England and in</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="4.44">Europe and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="5.34">doing and they&amp;#39;re doing this for one</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="4.88">reason and one reason only they realize</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="4.98">the economy&amp;#39;s coming down they realize</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="4.99">they need to get into Syria to</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="4.29">continually prop up this dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="2.37">having major major problems in the</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="3.06">Middle East</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="6.03">Yemen is falling apart Libya is falling</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="5.73">apart and now Iraq is completely falling</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="3.39">apart they did not expect this they</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="3.81">thought this was going to go smoothly</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="6.21">just like Ukraine and it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="6.51">everything is crashing down around them</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="5.94">and now they&amp;#39;re looking to create this</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="5.37">event to convince everyone that we need</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="4.2">to go to war that we need to send troops</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.16">in that it&amp;#39;s time for the American</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="4.95">people to go to World War 3 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="3.33">doing this because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="3.39">cover up the economic collapse because</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="5.1">they realize it&amp;#39;s coming and they</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="5.13">realize they have no alternative but to</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="3.81">do this and this is why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="5.28">this at this time and we can see right</text>
  <text start="225.21" dur="6.15">now that they will not stop they are</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="4.89">pushing this agenda forward and we are</text>
  <text start="231.36" dur="3.42">definitely going to see something occur</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.49">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="7.2">news and of course we know the economy</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="4.83">is really going down the toilet here and</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="3.75">of course the United States government</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.2">and other agencies are out there telling</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="4.23">us that the first quarter was terrible</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="5.25">because the bad weather but thank god</text>
  <text start="249.96" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s a point five percent positive range</text>
  <text start="253.08" dur="5.64">in GDP then of course they came back and</text>
  <text start="255.6" dur="4.8">they revised it to you know negative one</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="4.38">percent and they revised it again to</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="4.95">negative 1.8 percent and then now today</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re saying well it&amp;#39;s really like a</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="4.89">negative two point nine percent and you</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="4.71">have to remember they recalculated GDP</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="3.67">they threw in research and development</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="3.31">they went all the way back to 1929</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="4.74">calculated all the way up to the present</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="6.51">time to keep GDP in the positive range</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="4.71">and now it is falling apart this has</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="4.26">nothing to do with the winter weather</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="6.06">this has to do with people do not have</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="6.39">work people are not spending there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="289.42" dur="6.99">manufacturing and the entire economy is</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="6.09">a complete illusion and of course we</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="4.02">understand that they created Obamacare</text>
  <text start="298.6" dur="4.56">to raise revenue and they thought this</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="4.65">was going to help the economy well what</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re finding out is that the real</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.54">reason GDP completely collapsed upon</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="5.43">itself was because of Obamacare the</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="5.24">second and final revision of the first</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="6.12">quarter GDP what happened was instead of</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="5.68">Obamacare contributing 40 billion to</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="6.03">real GDP in the first quarter Obamacare</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="6.18">magically ended up subtracting 6.4</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="5.58">billion from GDP and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="6.03">came tumbling down Obamacare is a</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="4.8">complete failure it did not do what it</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="4.02">was supposed to do it is not giving</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="5.01">health benefits to pretty much anyone</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="4.5">but don&amp;#39;t worry Goldman Sachs is out</text>
  <text start="341.35" dur="3.72">there and they&amp;#39;re saying well we have</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="3.3">some bad weather and yeah we revised it</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="4.14">down a little bit but now we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="5.49">at all the statistics and all the</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.79">illusion based information and we see</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="6.03">that GDP is going to grow to four</text>
  <text start="355" dur="6.21">percent in the second quarter of this</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="4.26">year it really looks good I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="3.45">going to really have a fantastic</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="4.35">recovery now why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re doing this to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="4.35">that we are headed to this amazing</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="5.06">recovery and everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="8.22">fine but we know this is not the truth</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="7.6">now durable goods they have also tumbled</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="4.95">durable goods orders tumbled to one</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="7.44">point zero percent this is the biggest</text>

  <text start="692.76" dur="4.41">we can see this is being used for many</text>
  <text start="695.01" dur="4.62">different reasons and this was</text>
  <text start="697.17" dur="4.41">completely set up by the Obama</text>
  <text start="699.63" dur="4.71">administration we know back in January</text>

  <text start="730.32" dur="3.48">difference it is your personal</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="3.63">information and we really don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="3.75">Supreme Court to tell us this that we</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="3.63">know that yes this is my personal</text>
  <text start="737.55" dur="3.51">information you can&amp;#39;t read it just like</text>

  <text start="753.78" dur="4.32">finally that they need a warrant well</text>
  <text start="756.72" dur="3.93">they pretty much need a warrant for</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="5.07">everything and also the federal judge</text>
  <text start="760.65" dur="5.52">says the no-fly list rules are</text>
  <text start="763.17" dur="4.38">unconstitutional really putting people</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="3.81">on a list saying that they can&amp;#39;t fly</text>
  <text start="767.55" dur="3.99">because there says there&amp;#39;s a suspected</text>

  <text start="774.75" dur="5.13">it well of course it&amp;#39;s unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="776.72" dur="6.7">they have to give a reason you have to</text>
  <text start="779.88" dur="5.13">prove why you&amp;#39;re on this list and right</text>
  <text start="783.42" dur="3.51">now a federal judge in Oregon said</text>
  <text start="785.01" dur="3.9">Tuesday that the rules surrounding the</text>
  <text start="786.93" dur="3.6">use of a no-fly list managed by the</text>

  <text start="812.4" dur="6.84">you&amp;#39;re on the list and why do we have</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="6.6">secret lists very interesting now the</text>
  <text start="819.24" dur="6.57">ACLU is out there and they are saying</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="8.91">that the police forces around the</text>

  <text start="830.76" dur="5.67">is not a good sign of things to come</text>
  <text start="833.34" dur="5.7">because they&amp;#39;re treating citizens like</text>

  <text start="854.58" dur="4.14">militarization of American policing</text>
  <text start="856.25" dur="5.11">warns that police departments across the</text>

  <text start="866.22" dur="5.99">of heavy-handed raids wait we see this</text>
  <text start="870.14" dur="4.63">completely across the United States</text>
  <text start="872.21" dur="6.07">every single local law enforcement is</text>

  <text start="895.32" dur="4.83">when the economy comes tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="898.14" dur="2.97">they need to control the American people</text>
  <text start="900.15" dur="2.37">because most of the people will be</text>
  <text start="901.11" dur="1.86">rioting because it will take them by</text>
  <text start="902.52" dur="3.72">surprise</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="5.31">they will be really shocked to see what</text>
  <text start="906.24" dur="3.78">is going to happen that their money will</text>

  <text start="910.02" dur="5.16">the markets people will be ransacking</text>
  <text start="912.24" dur="5.64">all different areas and the government</text>
  <text start="915.18" dur="4.77">is afraid that these people might rise</text>
  <text start="917.88" dur="4.26">up and try to remove them from power and</text>
  <text start="919.95" dur="4.62">this is why they needed to implement</text>
  <text start="922.14" dur="4.62">this strategy to control the American</text>
  <text start="924.57" dur="5.22">people and of course take those people</text>
  <text start="926.76" dur="5.1">from the streets who are a threat to the</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="3.99">government and remove them from the</text>

  <text start="942.06" dur="2.25">course there</text>
  <text start="942.96" dur="3.15">doing this because no one&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="944.31" dur="4.62">paying attention and of course whatever</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="4.71">is happening in Nigeria should be the</text>
  <text start="948.93" dur="3.39">focus of the Nigerian government and</text>

  <text start="952.32" dur="3.75">nothing to do with the United States I</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t know why the United States needs</text>
  <text start="956.07" dur="4.08">to get involved in all this well of</text>
  <text start="957.57" dur="4.35">course I do because wherever China is</text>
  <text start="960.15" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s where the United States has to be</text>
  <text start="961.92" dur="3.9">they cannot let China get the natural</text>

  <text start="972.96" dur="4.5">RAM this is the story they&amp;#39;re using to</text>
  <text start="975.45" dur="3.72">create the illusion of why the United</text>

  <text start="998.28" dur="3.87">decided to do this and they are really</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="4.95">intensifying this because they really</text>
  <text start="1002.15" dur="4.74">want US troops inside Nigeria the</text>

  <text start="1047.54" dur="6.3">House for the Chinese you want and</text>
  <text start="1050.24" dur="6.21">remember now Putin right now is saying</text>
  <text start="1053.84" dur="4.17">that Russia is considering banning state</text>
  <text start="1056.45" dur="3.3">companies and other strategically</text>
  <text start="1058.01" dur="4.14">important firms from holding accounts at</text>
  <text start="1059.75" dur="5.43">foreign owned banks Russia is</text>
  <text start="1062.15" dur="4.74">considering banning these companies</text>
  <text start="1065.18" dur="5.81">because they&amp;#39;re afraid of more sanctions</text>
  <text start="1066.89" dur="7.32">that are coming yesterday I reported on</text>
  <text start="1070.99" dur="6.26">Russia saying where President Putin was</text>
  <text start="1074.21" dur="7.24">asking the Russian parliament to</text>
  <text start="1077.25" dur="6.51">pretty much repeal the military usage in</text>
  <text start="1081.45" dur="4.14">Ukraine and right now the Russian</text>
  <text start="1083.76" dur="3.75">Federation Council has voted to repeal</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="3.81">the legislation which allows the use of</text>
  <text start="1087.51" dur="4.47">Russian Armed Forces on the territory of</text>
  <text start="1089.4" dur="6.06">Ukraine so they remove that right now</text>
  <text start="1091.98" dur="6.48">and right now Putin and Russia are</text>
  <text start="1095.46" dur="6.24">completely saying listen we remove this</text>
  <text start="1098.46" dur="6.599">we never had any intentions whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1101.7" dur="6.39">of invading Ukraine we left it up to the</text>
  <text start="1105.059" dur="4.441">people that people are deciding now of</text>
  <text start="1108.09" dur="4.29">course the United States is out there</text>
  <text start="1109.5" dur="8.25">saying well since Russia has done this</text>
  <text start="1112.38" dur="8.91">we&amp;#39;re going to maybe not place sanctions</text>
  <text start="1117.75" dur="4.65">on the Russian country itself because we</text>
  <text start="1121.29" dur="3.18">were just about to do that</text>
  <text start="1122.4" dur="4.29">we were about to play sanctions on many</text>
  <text start="1124.47" dur="4.829">of the different sectors and on Russia</text>
  <text start="1126.69" dur="4.38">and right now since Russia made this</text>
  <text start="1129.299" dur="4.62">move we&amp;#39;re going to back off a little</text>
  <text start="1131.07" dur="5.609">bit but continually and continually work</text>
  <text start="1133.919" dur="5.01">with these sanctions and put them into</text>
  <text start="1136.679" dur="5.281">place and get them and have them ready</text>
  <text start="1138.929" dur="3.87">just in case Russia decides to change</text>
  <text start="1141.96" dur="3.78">their mind</text>
  <text start="1142.799" dur="4.051">and of course we know for a fact they</text>
  <text start="1145.74" dur="3.36">were never going to place these</text>
  <text start="1146.85" dur="5.19">sanctions on different Russian sectors</text>
  <text start="1149.1" dur="5.64">and on the Russian government itself in</text>
  <text start="1152.04" dur="6.21">the country because they understand that</text>
  <text start="1154.74" dur="5.819">the US economy the European nations are</text>
  <text start="1158.25" dur="3.87">completely falling apart and if they did</text>
  <text start="1160.559" dur="5.521">this it would have a boomerang effect</text>
  <text start="1162.12" dur="5.46">and it would bring the European economy</text>
  <text start="1166.08" dur="3.96">and the United States economy to its</text>
  <text start="1167.58" dur="4.65">knees the people would look at this and</text>
  <text start="1170.04" dur="5.58">say you just place sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="1172.23" dur="4.65">and our economy is collapsing we blame</text>
  <text start="1175.62" dur="2.91">the central bankers in the US government</text>
  <text start="1176.88" dur="4.2">and they knew this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="1178.53" dur="5.55">and this is why they didn&amp;#39;t do it at all</text>
  <text start="1181.08" dur="6.18">but don&amp;#39;t worry NATO is still out there</text>
  <text start="1184.08" dur="5.28">and NATO is saying that they are not</text>
  <text start="1187.26" dur="4.08">going to cooperate with Russia NATO had</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="3.99">decided to extend its suspension on</text>
  <text start="1191.34" dur="5.04">practical cooperation with Russia</text>
  <text start="1193.35" dur="5.25">because it sees noes change in Moscow&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1196.38" dur="4.85">behavior right now and this is coming</text>
  <text start="1198.6" dur="6.449">from nato secretary general Rasmussen</text>

  <text start="1557.7" dur="5.16">approach Baghdad now of course what</text>
  <text start="1559.98" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>

  <text start="1570.54" dur="4.26">like they&amp;#39;re doing it because if we have</text>
  <text start="1573.09" dur="3.87">to remember the president said it</text>

  <text start="1580.08" dur="4.32">we have to to get them and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1582.48" dur="4.32">seeing is something a little differently</text>
  <text start="1584.4" dur="5.13">than when other people are reporting we</text>
  <text start="1586.8" dur="5.16">hear that Syrian warplanes and this is</text>
  <text start="1589.53" dur="4.44">coming out of the United States press</text>
  <text start="1591.96" dur="4.98">and they are saying that Syrian</text>

  <text start="1600.84" dur="4.17">Iraqi towns this week is further</text>
  <text start="1602.79" dur="4.56">evidence of the blurring between the two</text>
  <text start="1605.01" dur="4.97">countries borders as they face an</text>
  <text start="1607.35" dur="5.48">offensive by Islamic extreme</text>
  <text start="1609.98" dur="4.319">at least 57 Iraqi civilians were killed</text>
  <text start="1612.83" dur="3.329">and more than a hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="1614.299" dur="4.26">others were wounded by what local</text>
  <text start="1616.159" dur="4.89">officials say were Syrian warplanes that</text>
  <text start="1618.559" dur="4.71">struck several border areas of the Anbar</text>
  <text start="1621.049" dur="4.291">province Tuesday the reports of the</text>
  <text start="1623.269" dur="4.051">Syrian incursion into Iraq is a reminder</text>
  <text start="1625.34" dur="5.16">that the civil war in Syria and the</text>
  <text start="1627.32" dur="5.069">unrest in Iraq are not isolated but</text>
  <text start="1630.5" dur="2.94">linked in ways that threaten the</text>
  <text start="1632.389" dur="3.42">security of both</text>
  <text start="1633.44" dur="5.099">unfortunately the Syrian regime carried</text>

  <text start="1638.539" dur="6.061">in Anbar province and they are out there</text>
  <text start="1641.389" dur="4.741">telling everyone that yes it was Syria</text>
  <text start="1644.6" dur="4.02">they just flew in</text>
  <text start="1646.13" dur="3.72">they killed civilians and this is</text>
  <text start="1648.62" dur="4.14">uncalled for</text>
  <text start="1649.85" dur="6.539">of course serious out there saying we</text>
  <text start="1652.76" dur="5.639">did not fly into Iraq whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="1656.389" dur="3.211">didn&amp;#39;t do it and this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="1658.399" dur="2.49">the United States president what I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1659.6" dur="3.539">think what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="1660.889" dur="5.611">they&amp;#39;re trying to link and show that</text>
  <text start="1663.139" dur="7.441">Syria is killing people in Iraq right</text>
  <text start="1666.5" dur="7.649">now and the United States government is</text>
  <text start="1670.58" dur="8.099">is going after ISIL and Isis which is</text>
  <text start="1674.149" dur="7.051">between Syria and Iraq and we can see</text>
  <text start="1678.679" dur="5.191">that it&amp;#39;s blurring the line and we might</text>
  <text start="1681.2" dur="4.65">have to go into Syria to stop this and</text>
  <text start="1683.87" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re making it seem like Syria now</text>
  <text start="1685.85" dur="5.97">might be invading Iraq and where all</text>
  <text start="1688.85" dur="6.27">this is being used to create the</text>
  <text start="1691.82" dur="5.16">illusion that they have to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="1695.12" dur="3.72">and they&amp;#39;re going to continually do this</text>
  <text start="1696.98" dur="4.35">and there are many different ways they</text>
  <text start="1698.84" dur="7.13">can do this one way to do this of course</text>
  <text start="1701.33" dur="7.709">is to say that Isis attacked Turkey and</text>
  <text start="1705.97" dur="5.53">NATO needs to come in NATO treaty</text>
  <text start="1709.039" dur="4.801">requires members to come to defense of</text>
  <text start="1711.5" dur="5.01">partners the Islamic State of Iraq and</text>
  <text start="1713.84" dur="4.77">Syria or Isis has recap has captured a</text>
  <text start="1716.51" dur="4.35">number of small towns along the Iraq</text>
  <text start="1718.61" dur="5.429">turkey border and is threatening to take</text>
  <text start="1720.86" dur="6">territories inside Turkey itself which</text>
  <text start="1724.039" dur="4.74">could force fellow NATO members to come</text>
  <text start="1726.86" dur="3.75">to the nation&amp;#39;s defense now you have to</text>
  <text start="1728.779" dur="4.411">remember John Kerry is now meeting with</text>
  <text start="1730.61" dur="4.799">NATO if we look at this article 5 of the</text>
  <text start="1733.19" dur="4.53">North Atlantic Treaty States the parties</text>
  <text start="1735.409" dur="3.811">agree that an armed attack against one</text>
  <text start="1737.72" dur="3.72">or more of them in Europe or North</text>
  <text start="1739.22" dur="4.62">America shall be considered an attack</text>
  <text start="1741.44" dur="4.68">against them all and consequently</text>
  <text start="1743.84" dur="5.13">they agree that if such an armed attack</text>
  <text start="1746.12" dur="4.47">occurs each of them in exercise of the</text>
  <text start="1748.97" dur="3.93">right of individual or collective</text>
  <text start="1750.59" dur="4.05">self-defense recognized by article 51 of</text>
  <text start="1752.9" dur="4.35">the chart of the United Nations will</text>
  <text start="1754.64" dur="5.37">assist the party or parties so attacked</text>
  <text start="1757.25" dur="5.25">by taking forthwith individually and in</text>
  <text start="1760.01" dur="5.37">concert with other parties such actions</text>
  <text start="1762.5" dur="5.58">as it deems necessary including the use</text>

  <text start="1768.08" dur="5.16">the security of the North Atlantic area</text>
  <text start="1770.15" dur="5.25">so we can see right now they might show</text>
  <text start="1773.24" dur="3.6">that Isis and ISIL have attacked Turkey</text>
  <text start="1775.4" dur="4.83">of course this would be a false flag</text>
  <text start="1776.84" dur="5.67">event to bring the NATO forces into the</text>
  <text start="1780.23" dur="5.4">picture and of course we have to</text>
  <text start="1782.51" dur="6.69">remember Turkey was trying to use a</text>
  <text start="1785.63" dur="5.7">false flag and they took their military</text>
  <text start="1789.2" dur="7.41">personnel snuck them into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1791.33" dur="7.709">fired missiles from Syria into Turkey</text>
  <text start="1796.61" dur="4.559">and the turkey government was going to</text>
  <text start="1799.039" dur="4.02">say Syria was attacking so they can</text>
  <text start="1801.169" dur="3.99">bring NATO in so we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1803.059" dur="5.311">still up to their same old tricks and</text>
  <text start="1805.159" dur="6.061">they are trying to get NATO involved and</text>
  <text start="1808.37" dur="6.72">we might see that happen they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1811.22" dur="6.87">to blur the lines between Syria ISIL</text>
  <text start="1815.09" dur="6.78">Isis and Iraq right now and all of this</text>
  <text start="1818.09" dur="6.51">is being created for what the main event</text>
  <text start="1821.87" dur="5.25">and of course the main event will bring</text>
  <text start="1824.6" dur="4.86">this whole thing home where the people</text>
  <text start="1827.12" dur="5.46">of the United States the UK the European</text>
  <text start="1829.46" dur="5.91">nations will say enough s&amp;#39;en up let&amp;#39;s go</text>

  <text start="1835.37" dur="7.08">and Syria and get this done right now</text>
  <text start="1839.38" dur="4.63">Dick Cheney is out there and I mentioned</text>

  <text start="2072.5" dur="4.77">falls apart the financial institution</text>
  <text start="2075.05" dur="4.77">hit with some type of cyber attack so</text>

  <text start="2088.159" dur="3.601">would have nothing to do with the other</text>
  <text start="2089.78" dur="4.26">country that was hitting us this is</text>
  <text start="2091.76" dur="3.96">really a false flag event to make us</text>
  <text start="2094.04" dur="3.27">believe that they brought the economy</text>
  <text start="2095.72" dur="4.29">down but we already know the economy is</text>
  <text start="2097.31" dur="5.13">failing all of a sudden then they will</text>
  <text start="2100.01" dur="3.99">say we&amp;#39;ll need to do balance in the</text>
  <text start="2102.44" dur="3.51">bank&amp;#39;s you will not be able to get your</text>
  <text start="2104" dur="4.11">money out so any money that&amp;#39;s stuck in</text>

  <text start="2108.11" dur="4.56">not be able to access it at this point</text>
  <text start="2110.36" dur="5.48">we will see this happen in the UK and</text>
  <text start="2112.67" dur="6.03">the European nations Australia</text>
  <text start="2115.84" dur="4.81">Switzerland Canada all have balon</text>

  <text start="2145.82" dur="4.86">cyberattacks and physical attacks all of</text>
  <text start="2148.64" dur="5.67">this is going to happen at once because</text>
  <text start="2150.68" dur="6.33">they need to make this look incredible</text>
  <text start="2154.31" dur="5.82">to show the American people why we need</text>

  <text start="2160.13" dur="5.31">need to send your children to this next</text>
  <text start="2162.41" dur="5.19">war and they will push this as hard as</text>
  <text start="2165.44" dur="4.44">they can the president will come out</text>
  <text start="2167.6" dur="4.32">there the Fed will come out there saying</text>

  <text start="2174.47" dur="4.8">in a recovery as they kept telling us</text>
  <text start="2176.57" dur="5.34">all throughout this time period they</text>
  <text start="2179.27" dur="5.82">destroyed America and now it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="2181.91" dur="5.04">Americans to rise up and go to war and</text>
  <text start="2185.09" dur="4.65">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2193.1" dur="4.29">they will pump more money into the</text>
  <text start="2195.47" dur="4.11">system because what will be happening at</text>
  <text start="2197.39" dur="5.25">that time is countries around the world</text>
  <text start="2199.58" dur="5.25">will start dropping Treasury bonds</text>
