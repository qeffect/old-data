  <text start="229.38" dur="6.21">report but what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="8.359">worldwide is that the entire economic</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="8.52">system is coming down on itself and</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="6.521">imploding and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in many</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="5.61">different parts of the economy now we</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="4.5">see it in autos we see it in housing we</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="3.63">know the statistical numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="3.12">completely manipulated you can&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="253.35" dur="4.08">buy them they&amp;#39;d be manipulated for a</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="4.62">very long time and when we start to look</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="4.08">to see how companies are doing and what</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;ve been doing and we start to see</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.529">you know businesses like retail we start</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="4.201">to understand what is happening around</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="5.181">the world now remember to push</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="5.76">automobiles to push houses to push</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="6.31">education everyone pretty much has to</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="4.979">take out a loan I mean in today&amp;#39;s market</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="5.819">very few can just go out and pay cash</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="7.681">for a car for a house or for an</text>
  <text start="283.349" dur="6.661">education and they have to go and take</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="4.97">out a loan and become indebted to</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="5.159">whatever they&amp;#39;re trying to do here and</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="5.08">when people start to realize that they</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="4.021">can&amp;#39;t take out anymore debt it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="4.92">too much they can&amp;#39;t pay it off they</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="4.289">don&amp;#39;t do these things anymore and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.17">starting to see this in the immoral</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="4.951">automobile industry now in the past</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ve been covering this and we&amp;#39;ve known</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="4.14">and we&amp;#39;ve been following it and we seen</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="5.73">that the automobile industry they have</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="6.48">been channel stuffing dealerships which</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="4.53">means they just fill up the lots with as</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="5.25">many cars as possible they</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="5.7">count those as sales and then they give</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="4.82">incentives to the dealers to try to move</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="5.55">the cars so when you do this</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="5.02">manufacturing of course is up sales look</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="4.5">up but all the cars are just sitting</text>
  <text start="334.14" dur="4.74">there we&amp;#39;re running into a problem right</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="5.13">now and actually before I start this to</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="5.31">move the cars they also bring in the</text>
  <text start="341.67" dur="5.01">subprime sub subprime and anyone that</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="3.48">has a heartbeat to move these cars out</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="2.37">of the Lots and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="347.67" dur="4.35">delinquencies move up because people</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.22">really can&amp;#39;t afford them well those days</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="5.64">are over because we&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="5.1">people this is the problem and they</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="3.84">already went through the sub sub sub</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="4.8">prime and anyone with a heartbeat and</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="4.5">around the world people are losing their</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="4.23">jobs we see austerity being pushed all</text>
  <text start="366" dur="5.34">over the place and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="5.19">automobile sales in Europe and in the</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="5.25">United States they are declining very</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="5.13">very rapidly BMW their stock is tumble</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="4.95">Mercedes the same thing is happening and</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.85">we also see it here in the US car sales</text>
  <text start="381.54" dur="4.8">are horrific right now we also see that</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="5.91">existing home sales they have dropped</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="6.66">for the seventh straight month in a row</text>
  <text start="390.48" dur="4.8">now think about this for a second during</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.16">the spring and the summer this is the</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="5.82">best time to sell a home it&amp;#39;s warm out</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="3.6">the grass is green people say hey you</text>

  <text start="406.11" dur="4.05">to school get settled in it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="3.12">easier to move in the warm weather than</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="4.71">it is in winter when you have snow and</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="6.24">ice and during this spring and summer</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="6.03">season what have we seen we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="417.93" dur="6.03">housing market decline now u.s.</text>
  <text start="420.9" dur="7.14">homebuilder stocks they&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="7.5">worst time ever since 2007 August data</text>
  <text start="428.04" dur="5.94">that was revised lower September plunged</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="6.39">down by 3.4 percent this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="6.39">drop since February of 2016 and when we</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.53">look back in time we can see that 7</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="7.11">months in a row existing home sales is</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="4.72">just terrible</text>
  <text start="447.48" dur="4.2">I mean there&amp;#39;s no other way to explain</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="4.77">this it&amp;#39;s just awful I mean when was the</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="3.109">last time we saw this we got to go all</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="4.799">the way back to</text>
  <text start="454.789" dur="6.821">2013 and then before that during the</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="5.97">Great Recession when we were coming into</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="5.19">it and here we are once again remember</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="4.821">what the central bankers have done they</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="4.95">have propped up the housing industry</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="4.03">with the government&amp;#39;s help they propped</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="3.53">up the auto industry with the</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="5.85">government&amp;#39;s help they propped up the</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="5.56">college industry where people have to</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="5.01">take out student loans to go to college</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="6.06">and what are we finding out from all</text>
  <text start="484.35" dur="4.52">these different areas well it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="5.22">starting to fall apart think about it</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="5.769">kids are going to school they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="4.29">out with all this debt they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="494.639" dur="3.96">the jobs the high-paying jobs that are</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="4.59">promised to them so they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="498.599" dur="4.261">these part-time low-paying jobs they</text>
  <text start="501" dur="4.199">can&amp;#39;t pay back their student loans and</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="5.04">then the government has to offer these</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="4.831">programs to help them pay the loans off</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="4.53">so they don&amp;#39;t default on them which you</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="4.379">still have to pay them but they want</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="4.859">people to continually pay on these loans</text>
  <text start="514.409" dur="3.99">and what happens is they say okay how</text>
  <text start="517.289" dur="3.031">much you&amp;#39;re making all right you&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="518.399" dur="3.421">part-time job what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;re we</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="3.48">calculate it and you&amp;#39;ll have 30 years to</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="5.07">pay this off for 25 years whatever it is</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="7.02">and this is because they cannot find</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="6.449">good jobs yes they&amp;#39;re telling us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="5.61">all these jobs out there and again if</text>
  <text start="533.339" dur="6.091">this is the case we would see supply and</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="5.21">demand kick in we would say okay there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.74">a huge demand but the supply</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="6.699">non-existent and what do they do they</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="7.35">raise the salary to attract individuals</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="5.881">to make people become educated in that</text>
  <text start="551.52" dur="5.48">job and then pay them a really good</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="6.059">salary we&amp;#39;re not seeing this at all</text>
  <text start="557" dur="5.05">so where all these drops may be in the</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="4.68">service industry maybe in restaurants</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="5.01">but those are declining too so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="564.959" dur="2.761">seeing these great jobs that everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="3.75">talking about</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="4.38">and once again I do have to mention if</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="2.969">you ever worked in a corporation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="4.44">something they called open wrecks where</text>
  <text start="573.779" dur="5.25">you in a department you have open wrecks</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="4.169">where you&amp;#39;re going to hire someone but</text>
  <text start="579.029" dur="3.06">you never want to give them up you</text>
  <text start="580.709" dur="3.661">always want to hold on to them and</text>
  <text start="582.089" dur="5.971">sometimes a department has you know 10</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="5.16">15 or so open wrecks</text>
  <text start="588.06" dur="3.39">and you don&amp;#39;t want to say hey listen we</text>
  <text start="589.53" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t need anyone in this position so we</text>
  <text start="591.45" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t need these open wrecks they always</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="4.11">keep them and they interview people even</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="3.86">though they don&amp;#39;t hire actually</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="4.65">sometimes management says continue to</text>
  <text start="599.96" dur="4.51">interview people but we&amp;#39;re in a hiring</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="5.55">freeze right now so you can&amp;#39;t hire</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="5.82">anyone but the stats show that these</text>
  <text start="607.68" dur="4.91">companies have all of these positions</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="6.3">open it&amp;#39;s very misleading</text>
  <text start="612.59" dur="6.7">now countries they have been preparing</text>
  <text start="616.59" dur="6.12">to transition away from the dollar for a</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="5.4">very long time and what they were hoping</text>
  <text start="622.71" dur="3.45">if we go back a couple of years they</text>
  <text start="624.69" dur="4.56">were hoping the central bank system</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="5.25">would be transitioned to China and this</text>
  <text start="629.25" dur="3.75">is what they were preparing that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="631.41" dur="3.72">they moved all the manufacturing this is</text>
  <text start="633" dur="3.66">why the deep State was moving everything</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="2.67">out of the United States working with</text>
  <text start="636.66" dur="2.94">the central bank because they knew</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="4.74">eventually what was going to happen is</text>
  <text start="639.6" dur="5.04">the central the United States was going</text>
  <text start="642.54" dur="5.37">to completely implode on itself</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="5.67">economically and they had to move</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="4.14">everything out of the United States to</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="4.38">bring the United States down to the</text>
  <text start="652.05" dur="5.04">level of all the other countries and if</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="4.68">they could do this and then somehow get</text>
  <text start="657.09" dur="4.32">rid of the Constitution this would be a</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="3.77">huge plus to the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="661.41" dur="3.99">deep&amp;#39; say they hate the Constitution</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="4.72">they don&amp;#39;t like people having rights</text>
  <text start="665.4" dur="3.69">they don&amp;#39;t like this at all so during</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="2.97">that time period they thought they were</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="3.66">going to have this event and they</text>
  <text start="670.83" dur="3.87">thought oh we&amp;#39;ll transition after the</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="3.39">war and everything will start up and</text>
  <text start="674.7" dur="4.47">China just like it did during world war</text>
  <text start="676.14" dur="4.5">ii with Bretton Woods after the war</text>
  <text start="679.17" dur="3.69">everyone gave the United States their</text>
  <text start="680.64" dur="4.98">gold then the Fed took over and they</text>
  <text start="682.86" dur="6.63">took the gold most likely we have no</text>
  <text start="685.62" dur="6.26">gold today and then in 1971 they wanted</text>
  <text start="689.49" dur="4.5">more control so we we came off of</text>
  <text start="691.88" dur="4.33">Bretton Woods because country saying you</text>
  <text start="693.99" dur="4.53">know you&amp;#39;re creating a lot of country</text>
  <text start="696.21" dur="3.9">currency and we would like our gold back</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="3.42">and of course they called it you know</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="4.62">people in the gold market who are</text>
  <text start="701.94" dur="4.02">speculating and we had to stop them so</text>
  <text start="704.73" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s why we had to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="705.96" dur="2.97">standard well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="707.49" dur="3.57">story they told us that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="708.93" dur="3.96">really happened they didn&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="711.06" dur="4.02">back the gold because most likely they</text>
  <text start="712.89" dur="5.25">didn&amp;#39;t have any and the central bank</text>
  <text start="715.08" dur="4.59">wanted all the control of creating as</text>
  <text start="718.14" dur="3.4">much currency as they possibly could and</text>
  <text start="719.67" dur="4.27">let the government borrow as</text>
  <text start="721.54" dur="5.099">they wanted this way they can corrupt</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="5.63">them even further but we can see that</text>
  <text start="726.639" dur="5.851">Russia China a lot of the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="729.57" dur="5.23">they have been transitioning for a very</text>
  <text start="732.49" dur="3.93">long time Russia and China they have</text>
  <text start="734.8" dur="3.75">been preparing to dish the dollar but</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="4.979">things have changed right now now</text>
  <text start="738.55" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re pivoting to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="741.399" dur="5.19">central bank now Russia they have taken</text>
  <text start="743.709" dur="4.771">control over their central bank they</text>
  <text start="746.589" dur="3.631">dictate what they want done yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="4.77">still private wasn&amp;#39;t Central Bank but</text>
  <text start="750.22" dur="6.09">they can control completely Russia has a</text>
  <text start="753.25" dur="5.399">very little bit of debt right now China</text>
  <text start="756.31" dur="4.68">has a lot of debt they&amp;#39;ve been using the</text>
  <text start="758.649" dur="4.291">central banks easy money to build</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="3.45">everything and I think what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="762.94" dur="3.629">going to do once the system comes down</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="4.53">is they&amp;#39;ll have everything built but</text>
  <text start="766.569" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;ll have gold to back everything up</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="4.02">and then hopefully with the central bank</text>
  <text start="771.31" dur="3.42">on they&amp;#39;re just gonna say you know what</text>
  <text start="772.99" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re not even paying for all this debt</text>
  <text start="774.73" dur="5.31">so many nations they have gone public</text>
  <text start="777.61" dur="5.61">with their intention to ditch the dollar</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="4.71">in part or in whole right now and this</text>
  <text start="783.22" dur="4.29">is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in the last</text>
  <text start="784.75" dur="5.1">couple of months here Europe unveils</text>
  <text start="787.51" dur="5.699">special purpose vehicle to bypass Swift</text>
  <text start="789.85" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re gonna create their own payment</text>
  <text start="793.209" dur="3.331">system because they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="794.23" dur="4.589">move away from the Federal Reserve no</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="3.96">they know that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="798.819" dur="3.901">coming apart and coming down quickly</text>
  <text start="800.5" dur="6.06">this was planned but things are changing</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="5.97">right now Russia says time has come to</text>
  <text start="806.56" dur="3.839">ditch the dollar European powers</text>
  <text start="808.69" dur="4.649">prepared a ditch dollar and trade with</text>
  <text start="810.399" dur="6.361">Iran Russia and India ditch dollar in</text>

  <text start="816.76" dur="5.36">says we may abandon the dollar in oil</text>
  <text start="818.98" dur="5.909">trade as as it&amp;#39;s becoming too risky</text>
  <text start="822.12" dur="5.26">Venezuela ditches u.s. dollar will use</text>
  <text start="824.889" dur="4.32">euros for international trade and then</text>
  <text start="827.38" dur="5.61">all of a sudden they started with the</text>
  <text start="829.209" dur="6.211">crypto currency the el potro so we can</text>
  <text start="832.99" dur="5.18">see that everything is changing right</text>
  <text start="835.42" dur="6.45">now and countries they are slowly</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="7.719">transitioning away from the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="841.87" dur="5.639">know and they&amp;#39;re doing it slowly so it</text>
  <text start="845.889" dur="3.12">doesn&amp;#39;t disrupt everything and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="847.509" dur="3.721">blame for bringing down the entire</text>
  <text start="849.009" dur="3.33">system none of these countries want to</text>
  <text start="851.23" dur="3.47">be blamed for that and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="852.339" dur="5.601">they&amp;#39;re moving so slowly to get</text>
  <text start="854.7" dur="5.13">rid of what they have because if they</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="4.68">just dumped all their Treasuries they</text>
  <text start="859.83" dur="4.98">dumped their reserves well guess what</text>
  <text start="862.62" dur="3.96">the news would report well Russia just</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="3.21">dumped all the Treasuries all the</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="3.66">reserves were China dumped all their</text>
  <text start="868.02" dur="4.53">reserves all their Treasuries and they</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="3.78">crashed the market they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="872.55" dur="5.04">blamed for this so they do it very</text>
  <text start="874.02" dur="5.49">slowly over the many months and they</text>
  <text start="877.59" dur="4.74">make sure that they separate themselves</text>
  <text start="879.51" dur="4.77">and while they&amp;#39;re doing this they create</text>
  <text start="882.33" dur="4.08">bilateral trades with other countries</text>
  <text start="884.28" dur="4.38">they start using their own currencies</text>
  <text start="886.41" dur="4.59">those countries that they&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="888.66" dur="4.5">with they use their own currency and</text>
  <text start="891" dur="4.65">both countries now are bypassing the</text>
  <text start="893.16" dur="4.29">dollar completely and we already see</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="5.25">that Trump pretty much is on the same</text>
  <text start="897.45" dur="5.52">pages all this where he&amp;#39;s setting up now</text>
  <text start="900.9" dur="5.67">bilateral trades with all these</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="7.11">different countries Europe Japan Canada</text>
  <text start="906.57" dur="5.85">Mexico getting rid of the globalist</text>
  <text start="910.08" dur="5.61">system so what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="5.52">now is we are heading towards this major</text>
  <text start="915.69" dur="2.79">transition countries have been preparing</text>
  <text start="917.94" dur="2.37">for this</text>
  <text start="918.48" dur="4.14">Russia and China they have a huge amount</text>
  <text start="920.31" dur="4.86">of gold because they need that for</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="5.46">confidence because once the Federal</text>
  <text start="925.17" dur="4.35">Reserve Note dies you know countries are</text>

  <text start="931.2" dur="6">have gold we have the confidence builder</text>
  <text start="934.44" dur="4.23">here you don&amp;#39;t have to worry and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.2" dur="3.12">why they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating so much</text>
  <text start="938.67" dur="3.99">gold this is what countries were asking</text>
  <text start="940.32" dur="5.76">for their gold back and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.66" dur="4.68">accumulating gold except for the US so</text>
  <text start="946.08" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through this</text>
  <text start="947.34" dur="3.84">transition yes they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="3.81">people that are hurt I mean go back to</text>

  <text start="964.65" dur="4.29">easy and then things got a lot a bit a</text>
  <text start="967.02" dur="4.02">little bit easier as we moved into the</text>
  <text start="968.94" dur="4.95">late 70s into the 80s when credit</text>
