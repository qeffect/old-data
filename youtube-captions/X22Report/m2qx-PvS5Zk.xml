  <text start="60.559" dur="4.261">episode is time is now the enemy of the</text>
  <text start="63.17" dur="5.58">central bankers as the illusion of a</text>
  <text start="64.82" dur="6.15">healthy economy disappears let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="68.75" dur="6.71">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="70.97" dur="8.189">news today we can see the market is</text>
  <text start="75.46" dur="8.01">rapidly moving higher now we kind of</text>
  <text start="79.159" dur="6.63">expect this at this point we know the</text>
  <text start="83.47" dur="6.64">existing administration the central</text>
  <text start="85.789" dur="5.97">bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re going to create this</text>
  <text start="90.11" dur="3.959">illusion and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it unfold</text>
  <text start="91.759" dur="5.67">right in front of our eyes they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="94.069" dur="5.521">to create this illusion where people are</text>
  <text start="97.429" dur="4.711">going to be sucked in into believing</text>
  <text start="99.59" dur="4.74">that everything is perfect they want</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="8.61">this to happen this is part of their</text>
  <text start="104.33" dur="11.069">agenda they want people to believe that</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="9.66">they have completely recovered the</text>
  <text start="115.399" dur="8.491">economy now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at other</text>
  <text start="120.41" dur="6.359">information not the stock market we look</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="5.459">at the statistical information that the</text>
  <text start="126.769" dur="5.491">government puts out but we look very</text>
  <text start="129.349" dur="6.811">very closely at it and we find out that</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="7.17">most of it is fake phony and false a lot</text>
  <text start="136.16" dur="9.45">of it they manipulate a lot of revisions</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="9.75">and we can see right now their illusion</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="8.51">is falling apart time is against them</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="7.86">right now the VLS put out a report and</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="6.33">they are saying that the number of job</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="6.21">openings right now well they&amp;#39;ve dropped</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="6.42">from the upward revised September print</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="8.73">which is 5.6 3 million to 5.5 3 million</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="8.53">that&amp;#39;s down some like 97,000 and the job</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="6.57">openings right now they&amp;#39;re in a serious</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="6.72">decline so what does this mean it means</text>
  <text start="178.55" dur="6.159">the US labor market is rolling over</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="5.8">despite the near record number of job</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="5.221">openings the pace of hiring has failed</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="5.52">to keep up and I discussed the job</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="6.12">openings once before in these huge</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="7.2">corporations they have these open rex</text>
  <text start="196.05" dur="6.06">each department gets them and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="4.55">like to lose them because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="202.11" dur="6.45">difficult to get back so what they do is</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="7.36">they interview people now a lot of times</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="6.179">companies put freezes on hiring or you</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="5.67">make it so difficult that no one can</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="4.921">ever fill that position but you want the</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="2.64">wreck open because you know you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="4.65">to use it maybe some time in the future</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="5.7">when things get better and a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="4.05">companies what they do is they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.23">interview people they&amp;#39;ll keep the job</text>
  <text start="228.36" dur="7.05">Rex open they&amp;#39;ll show that there&amp;#39;s a job</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="7.97">opening but they have no way of filling</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="6.72">it they&amp;#39;re not going to fill it and</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;re just trying to keep that wreck</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="7.77">open and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="9.75">now but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="7.38">annual rate of change in hiring drop</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="6.45">below two-point-two percent compared to</text>
  <text start="257.28" dur="6.509">the 5.2 million a year ago this was the</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="7.44">biggest contraction in hiring since</text>
  <text start="263.789" dur="7.651">march of 2013 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing when</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="7.92">we look at this this happened in the</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="7.89">year of 2007 going into 2008 and then</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="4.65">the economy came crashing down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.28">starting to see the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.76">once again and we can see that people</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="5.13">are still having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="5.82">finding work many people have reduced</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.65">salaries many people have gotten</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="3.66">part-time jobs once they had a full-time</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="3.72">job but they still wonderful time job</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="5.52">all they can find is a part-time job and</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="7.02">this is showing up in many different</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="6.18">areas of the economy one being retail to</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="6.27">being the restaurant industry three</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="6.03">being in real estate and we know that</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="3.42">the real the restaurant performance</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="3.72">index</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="5.34">well that has been dropping traffic has</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="5.73">been drawing up in restaurants we also</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="6.24">see according to a restaurant tracker</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="5.55">NPD group traffic at us fast food</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="4.98">restaurants they fell by 1% in the third</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="7.05">quarter the sector&amp;#39;s first traffic</text>
  <text start="331.38" dur="7.17">decline in five years now the reason is</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="6">not that many Americans have migrated to</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="7.14">a higher wealth group and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="8.16">eating more expensive meals what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="7.95">happening right now is that going to</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="5.55">these fast-food restaurants they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="6.24">becoming too costly for many people</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="6.18">remember salaries are declining people</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="6.27">are coming from full-time to part-time</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="6.54">jobs and the MPD survey found that</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="4.02">seventy five percent of respondents said</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="5.01">they have to cut back on restaurant</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="4.68">dining as they keep a closer tab on</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="5.45">spending in most of all their purchases</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="6.27">and they&amp;#39;re saying that right now</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="6.61">restaurants fast-food restaurants</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="8.1">they&amp;#39;re just too expensive and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="5.7">bypassing them and we realize that this</text>
  <text start="389.22" dur="6.65">has been going on for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="8.49">and it started in retail it spread to</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="5.89">housing and we knew eventually it would</text>
  <text start="399.48" dur="4.55">come to the restaurant industry and then</text>
  <text start="401.76" dur="5.49">eventually the fast-food industry</text>
  <text start="404.03" dur="4.63">because it&amp;#39;s a trickle-down effect where</text>
  <text start="407.25" dur="3.84">everyone is going to be affected by this</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="4.59">and as more and more people can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="3.93">jobs as more and more people go from a</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="3.66">full-time job get laid off and go to a</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="6.03">part-time job we&amp;#39;re going to see more of</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="6">this this is why what the US government</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="3.63">what the central bankers are telling us</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="3.75">that the unemployment rate is at four</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="3.98">point six percent is absolutely</text>
  <text start="426.66" dur="5.7">ridiculous it makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="428.66" dur="5.94">because again when you see an economy</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="5.4">doing well and unemployment is so low</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="7.3">you see the economy expand you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="7.909">it contract you don&amp;#39;t see retail stores</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="6.78">getting ready to lay off 5,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="445.669" dur="6.731">during a holiday season</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="6.329">I know they put on temporary workers but</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="5.519">those individuals that thought they had</text>
  <text start="455.009" dur="5.311">a job they&amp;#39;re going to be let go right</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="5.791">after the holiday season along with all</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="5.61">the temporary workers and we see in the</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="4.17">housing industry well that&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="3.81">completely fall apart remember the</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="4.289">bubbles have reached the top they are</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="4.47">coming down right now I&amp;#39;m seeing more</text>
  <text start="472.169" dur="5.491">and more homes on the market people are</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="4.769">reducing their prices the interest rates</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="2.759">are entering up a little bit and just</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="4.891">think about this is just a small little</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="5.071">increase what a gigantic effect that has</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="5.16">on the real estate market can you</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="6.6">imagine what would happen if these times</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="4.59">were normal the real estate market would</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="3.03">come crashing down why do you think</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="4.889">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the interest rates</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="6.93">near zero negative in Europe negative in</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="4.951">Japan because they know and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="4.2">that mortgage applications they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="503.46" dur="5.76">for the second week in a row and they</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.849">dip by 0.7% and the week ending December</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="6.27">second and the situation is not getting</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="5.641">better it&amp;#39;s getting worse now we know</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="6.359">that banks they&amp;#39;ve been caught</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="5.969">manipulating the interest rate they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="5.851">been caught manipulating the precious</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="9.231">metals and we see that the European</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="9.96">Commission has fine JP Morgan HSBC about</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="7.81">485 million euros for rigging the Euro</text>

  <text start="540.75" dur="4.97">antitrust regulators they wrapped up a</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="6.45">five-year investigation into the scandal</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="6.239">three banks colluded on euro interest</text>

  <text start="551.959" dur="6.311">exchange sensitive information in breach</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="7.11">of EU antitrust rules it&amp;#39;s amazing how</text>
  <text start="558.27" dur="5.79">these banks continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="5.67">market they&amp;#39;re caught they pay this</text>
  <text start="564.06" dur="6.719">small little nothing fine and they</text>

  <text start="572.1" dur="8.159">absolutely ridiculous these banks people</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="7.139">should go to jail but no one does we see</text>
  <text start="580.259" dur="4.711">Italian Prime Minister Renzi he said he</text>
  <text start="582.869" dur="4.77">wasn&amp;#39;t going to resign and now he is</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="5.399">resigning after the approval of the</text>
  <text start="587.639" dur="5.61">budget bill we see the Italian</text>
  <text start="590.369" dur="6.21">government well they&amp;#39;re preparing to</text>
  <text start="593.249" dur="6.09">nationalize monte dei paschi and they</text>
  <text start="596.579" dur="5.01">realize there is nothing else they can</text>

  <text start="601.589" dur="6.09">control of this Bank it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="603.769" dur="7.96">state-owned bank they will have a huge</text>
  <text start="607.679" dur="8.25">interest in this and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="611.729" dur="6.42">about forty percent of the bank and we</text>
  <text start="615.929" dur="5.52">can see right now that the situation</text>
  <text start="618.149" dur="6.571">throughout Europe is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="621.449" dur="5.58">worse as time goes on here in the United</text>

  <text start="627.029" dur="4.98">worse as time goes on and we know that</text>
  <text start="630.169" dur="6.79">everything that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="632.009" dur="7.68">putting out there is fake and phony when</text>
  <text start="636.959" dur="5.27">it has to do with the recovery they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="639.689" dur="4.92">building this up because as we know</text>
  <text start="642.229" dur="4.931">Obama is going to leave office Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.609" dur="5.43">going to come in and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="6.479">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to bring the whole</text>
  <text start="650.039" dur="6.35">system down and they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="653.639" dur="8.67">it down Jim Rickards was out there</text>
  <text start="656.389" dur="8.41">saying that the economy most likely will</text>
  <text start="662.309" dur="6.09">be brought down during the trump</text>
  <text start="664.799" dur="5.58">administration now many individuals are</text>
  <text start="668.399" dur="4.98">saying this I had a discussion with</text>
  <text start="670.379" dur="4.65">vicks we&amp;#39;re on the x 22 report spotlight</text>
  <text start="673.379" dur="5.341">youtube channel and he said the same</text>
  <text start="675.029" dur="5.91">thing that most likely this economy is</text>
  <text start="678.72" dur="5.069">going to be coming down during the trump</text>
  <text start="680.939" dur="4.92">administration and i don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="683.789" dur="3.84">going to have to go that far into his</text>
  <text start="685.859" dur="5.48">administration before they decide it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.629" dur="7.28">time to bring this entire thing down</text>
  <text start="691.339" dur="7.99">because they&amp;#39;re they don&amp;#39;t want to wait</text>
  <text start="694.909" dur="6.16">for some type of an event which they</text>
  <text start="699.329" dur="3.78">can&amp;#39;t control the system coming down</text>
  <text start="701.069" dur="4.35">they want to bring it down they want to</text>
  <text start="703.109" dur="4.741">blame it on either Trump or maybe Russia</text>
  <text start="705.419" dur="6.65">or another group and we can see right</text>
  <text start="707.85" dur="4.219">now they&amp;#39;re preparing to do this</text>
  <text start="712.38" dur="6.3">and when this system comes down well</text>
  <text start="715.71" dur="6.32">it&amp;#39;s gonna come down hard and fast it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="718.68" dur="8.21">not going to be a slow drawn out thing</text>
  <text start="722.03" dur="11.82">we can see right now the patterns are</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="11.41">pretty much the same during 1929 during</text>
  <text start="733.85" dur="10.78">2008 and now now right before the crash</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="8.64">the market hits all-time new highs to</text>
  <text start="744.63" dur="6.3">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="746.94" dur="7.8">fine and then what happens is the whole</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="6.51">thing just completely falls apart they</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="7.49">bring it down they stop the life support</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="7.2">and the whole thing just collapses</text>
  <text start="762.23" dur="6.25">because there&amp;#39;s no purpose right now</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="7.5">into dragging this out because the</text>
  <text start="768.48" dur="8.67">Middle East is lost the petrodollar is</text>
  <text start="772.14" dur="7.53">doomed the system has so much debt it</text>
  <text start="777.15" dur="6.89">cannot be sustained they know that these</text>
  <text start="779.67" dur="8.61">jobs that people are getting right now</text>
