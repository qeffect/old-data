  <text start="33.739" dur="7.01">today&amp;#39;s date is September 9 2013 and the</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="8.429">title of this episode is Russia to us a</text>
  <text start="40.749" dur="7.621">check it&amp;#39;s your move now and let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="45.979" dur="7.35">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="48.37" dur="9.189">the oldest bank in the world now faces</text>
  <text start="53.329" dur="7.89">critical need to raise 2.5 billion in</text>
  <text start="57.559" dur="6.92">fresh capital and it&amp;#39;s more than double</text>
  <text start="61.219" dur="9.181">what they originally planned the Monte</text>
  <text start="64.479" dur="8.681">Paschi bank in Italy is looking to do a</text>
  <text start="70.4" dur="7.38">ballon and we have to remember that</text>
  <text start="73.16" dur="7.14">during Cyprus they were officials out</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="5.49">there saying this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="80.3" dur="5.1">template and then they decided no no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="5.04">sorry this is not the template I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="85.4" dur="5.55">we made a mistake here but we also come</text>
  <text start="88.31" dur="5.67">to find that there was a document that</text>
  <text start="90.95" dur="6.39">was created by the FDIC and the Bank of</text>
  <text start="93.98" dur="6.62">England talking about balance and this</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="8.7">document came out in December of 2012</text>
  <text start="100.6" dur="10.03">Cyprus balan came started i believe it</text>
  <text start="106.04" dur="6.84">was around april or so or march of 2013</text>
  <text start="110.63" dur="5.79">and they are still under capital</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="6.81">controls people&amp;#39;s money were was taken</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="5.82">from them and it was it was around forty</text>
  <text start="119.69" dur="5.91">seven percent and it was substituted</text>
  <text start="122.24" dur="4.95">with worthless bank stock and the rest</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="2.969">of their money was frozen in their</text>
  <text start="127.19" dur="2.939">accounts where they&amp;#39;re not allowed to</text>
  <text start="128.569" dur="6.351">touch it and they&amp;#39;re only allowed to</text>
  <text start="130.129" dur="7.711">take out a certain amount each day and</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="5.62">it seems like they&amp;#39;re going to do a</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="4.59">bailing for the oldest bank in italy</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="3.69">and this goes on to say that some</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="5.25">analysts said the bank&amp;#39;s best option to</text>
  <text start="144.23" dur="6.66">avoid nationalization could be a debt to</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="7.139">equity swap and it they couldn&amp;#39;t convert</text>
  <text start="150.89" dur="7.049">some bonds it has already into shares</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="5.76">that would be a hit for bondholders and</text>
  <text start="157.939" dur="4.44">also for shareholders but it would be in</text>
  <text start="160.579" dur="4.05">line with the new bailing guidelines for</text>
  <text start="162.379" dur="6.36">banks and we can see this spreading all</text>
  <text start="164.629" dur="7.291">across Europe and into America and they</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="7.051">laid this out that they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="6.87">balance because under the US law and</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="6.449">England there are no bailouts at this</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="5.759">time so they have to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="182.239" dur="4.53">prop up the banks and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="184.549" dur="5.821">it is to use the people&amp;#39;s money that are</text>
  <text start="186.769" dur="7.5">in the bank&amp;#39;s at this time and when bail</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="6.78">out bail ins do come and you still have</text>
  <text start="194.269" dur="6.451">money in there just like in Cyprus the</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="6">banks are going to be shut down the</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="6.299">money is going to be frozen your money</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="7.53">will be removed and they will issue you</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="5.491">worthless bank stock you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="5.669">anything with it because it&amp;#39;s worthless</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="6.899">and you will only be allowed to take out</text>
  <text start="216.349" dur="5.901">a certain amount of money each day which</text>
  <text start="219.409" dur="5.97">and that&amp;#39;s called capital controls and</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="5.799">we can see throughout Europe and the US</text>
  <text start="225.379" dur="5.491">the economy is completely in a</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="4.891">disconnect to the markets the markets</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="3.75">are going to continually to rise they</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.769">have the plunge protection team today</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="6.06">the high-frequency traders pumping this</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="5.49">market up as high as it possibly can to</text>
  <text start="240.68" dur="6.72">keep all eyes off of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="243.199" dur="7.4">happening in the world and again they</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="7.289">will continue to continue to keep gold</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="7.39">suppressed until they can&amp;#39;t do it any</text>
  <text start="254.689" dur="5.97">more and we continually see this they</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="5.46">are not going to let gold go any higher</text>
  <text start="260.659" dur="5.04">and this is a perfect opportunity to</text>
  <text start="263.449" dur="4.65">purchase more gold silver platinum</text>
  <text start="265.699" dur="4.44">palladium anything you can get your</text>
  <text start="268.099" dur="4.711">hands on at this point because when gold</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="4.411">takes off you will not be able to get it</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="3.99">you will not be able to a</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="5.79">afford it and it&amp;#39;s going to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="6.72">very quickly and how do we know the</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="4.94">economy is not doing well well all we</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="3.93">have to do is look around the world and</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="5.92">I&amp;#39;m going to look around in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="7.08">right now and we can see that retailers</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="10.92">are closing their stores they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="11.69">out of business this year 2013 we saw</text>

  <text start="347.17" dur="4.65">best buy and i continually keep</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="5.25">repeating this because they were all</text>
  <text start="351.82" dur="5.98">thousands of store closings and if the</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="4.71">economy is getting better and people</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="4.23">have disposable income guess what they</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.04">do with their money they go and spend it</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="5.49">but when you get laid off and there was</text>
  <text start="365.15" dur="6.29">a lot of plan layoffs which are reported</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="7.53">in my last reporter previous report</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="6.82">these people have a tough time finding</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="6.48">work and even if you do find something</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s always for less money and a lot of</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="5.28">these people are finding temp jobs and</text>
  <text start="384.89" dur="4.29">they usually have to take one or two or</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="4.14">three temp jobs and they can&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="4.59">the same amount they were making before</text>
  <text start="390.95" dur="8.34">but they&amp;#39;re making enough just to live</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="7.86">and when people end up doing this they</text>
  <text start="399.29" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t have enough money to spend on an</text>
  <text start="401.63" dur="6.18">extra TV you know extra clothing oh I</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="2.55">just see this I just like it so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="2.91">going to</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="7.47">and people are not doing that anymore</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="7.88">and I&amp;#39;ve talked about real estate how</text>
  <text start="415.67" dur="5.55">mortgage applications are declining how</text>
  <text start="418.6" dur="6.52">JPMorgan Wells Fargo they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="7.83">people in the mortgage divisions and we</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="5.82">see that the traffic in in the new home</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="4.38">builders like DR Horton reporting the</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="4.29">traffic is decreasing and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="3.06">to see that sales are starting to slow</text>
  <text start="435.23" dur="3.48">plus we&amp;#39;re coming out of the summer</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="5.13">months the summer months are they good</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="4.86">times for real estate and again we had</text>
  <text start="441.62" dur="3.75">Obama out there in the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="4.83">summer telling everyone how great it is</text>
  <text start="445.37" dur="4.95">we have the unemployment numbers and all</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="4.59">people see as percentages and it came</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="4.59">down a point one percent and they say oh</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="5.64">look it&amp;#39;s all getting better the stock</text>
  <text start="454.91" dur="6.48">market is rising then if everything is</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="6.15">so great and real estate is so great why</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="8.4">is Wells Fargo expecting a drop in</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="7.38">mortgage origination Wells Fargo is</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="4.68">expected to post a decline in mortgage</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="5.67">originations in the third quarter and</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="8.22">will continue to cut jobs according to a</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="8.01">report in the Wall Street Journal in the</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="6.87">second quarter of this year they they</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="6.36">had a hundred and twelve billion dollars</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="7.38">in origination in the third quarter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="8.01">80 billion so we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="496.94" dur="7.77">starting to decline Wells Fargo has also</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="6.06">eliminated 3,000 positions in their</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="5.43">mortgage division and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="506.27" dur="6.15">continue to cut more people so how is</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="5.81">this a housing recovery there was also i</text>
  <text start="512.42" dur="5.46">think it was 1 800 east west mortgages i</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="4.41">discussed it in one of my previous</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="5.099">reports they completely closed down and</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.29">JP morgan is laying off people in</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="5.881">mortgage divisions so this tells you</text>
  <text start="525.65" dur="5.19">right there there is something going on</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="4.74">but they don&amp;#39;t want you to look over</text>
  <text start="530.84" dur="4.86">there don&amp;#39;t look at the economy everyone</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="4.59">move your eyes back to the stock market</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="5.31">and guess what gold is not doing</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="3.87">anything so don&amp;#39;t even don&amp;#39;t even worry</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="2.94">about buying golders</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="4.32">over or anything like that because we</text>
  <text start="543.95" dur="4.29">want to keep smack the central bankers</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="4.8">are going to keep smacking it down so</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="7.56">they don&amp;#39;t alert anyone to what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="7.95">going on here now this was rly this was</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="6.48">released late Friday JP Morgan closes</text>
  <text start="559.13" dur="5.19">precious metal sell recommendation and</text>
  <text start="562.28" dur="5.22">when I wrote this on the set no alerts I</text>
  <text start="564.32" dur="7.8">run shh don&amp;#39;t tell anyone gold is going</text>
  <text start="567.5" dur="8.04">to go way way up because instead of a</text>
  <text start="572.12" dur="5.61">cell it&amp;#39;s a by now and we&amp;#39;re going long</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="5.64">JPMorgan&amp;#39;s going long on it and that</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="6.09">tells you something Goldman Sachs also</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="5.64">reverse their position and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="5.04">a lot of financial institution starting</text>
  <text start="586.82" dur="5.13">to reverse their positions because the</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="5.25">smack down the big ones are finally most</text>
  <text start="591.95" dur="4.2">likely probably over and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="4.71">going to try to keep it stable at this</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="5.94">point until they can&amp;#39;t anymore because</text>
  <text start="598.82" dur="4.5">we do have this war coming up with Syria</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="4.61">which I&amp;#39;m going to discuss in a little</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="8.93">bit and they understand that things are</text>
  <text start="606.7" dur="5.55">happening they need to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="5.2">completely confused of what is really</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="4.14">going on and if they can keep gold</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="3.45">completely steady and have it pushed</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="3.78">down a little bit go up a little bit</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="4.68">people don&amp;#39;t really recognize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="3.9">going on the stock market keeps going up</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="4.53">so that&amp;#39;s a great sign that the economy</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="5.73">is getting better which is completely BS</text>
  <text start="630.2" dur="4.5">but that&amp;#39;s how people look at it but</text>
  <text start="632.96" dur="4.41">when we look around the world and we</text>
  <text start="634.7" dur="5.37">look at the nitty-gritty we see other</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="7.17">things that are happening right now and</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="7.82">this goes on to say that that the firm</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="6.18">quietly went along went long commodities</text>
  <text start="647.89" dur="6.25">specifically base metals and copper and</text>
  <text start="650.72" dur="9.57">the firm also closed its cell in</text>
  <text start="654.14" dur="8.85">precious metals now I know I talk a lot</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="4.92">about Obamacare because I just think</text>

  <text start="1031.61" dur="4.079">trying to make Assad use these chemical</text>
  <text start="1033.65" dur="6.12">weapons which we know he didn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="1035.689" dur="6.27">he invited the UN Security Council in he</text>
  <text start="1039.77" dur="4.289">put them up in a hotel and just so</text>
  <text start="1041.959" dur="6.651">happened the same day there was a</text>
  <text start="1044.059" dur="8.341">chemical attack in the rebel region and</text>
  <text start="1048.61" dur="9.25">not one rebel died in this so only the</text>
  <text start="1052.4" dur="7.409">people of Syria you know were died so it</text>
  <text start="1057.86" dur="4.59">makes no sense that Assad would invite</text>
  <text start="1059.809" dur="6.181">them in there and then use chemical</text>
  <text start="1062.45" dur="8.18">weapons he has to be a complete idiot to</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="7.98">do that but my point is is that from all</text>
  <text start="1070.63" dur="5.14">the drone attacks in these Middle</text>
  <text start="1073.97" dur="6.06">Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="8.07">the US has killed four thousand seven</text>

  <text start="1099.17" dur="7.5">war there was no war ever declared and</text>
  <text start="1103.48" dur="4.75">with these drones I mean think just</text>
  <text start="1106.67" dur="3.3">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1108.23" dur="4.43">you&amp;#39;re in an apartment building and</text>
  <text start="1109.97" dur="5.49">someone and the third floor has</text>
  <text start="1112.66" dur="4.06">committed some type of crime now you</text>
  <text start="1115.46" dur="2.76">have nothing to do with that but you</text>
  <text start="1116.72" dur="4.2">live upstairs in the same apartment</text>
  <text start="1118.22" dur="6.75">building a drone comes in and fires</text>
  <text start="1120.92" dur="6.36">missiles into the building your wife is</text>
  <text start="1124.97" dur="6.69">killed and your child is killed why</text>
  <text start="1127.28" dur="8.46">they&amp;#39;re trying to kill this person who</text>
  <text start="1131.66" dur="8.7">committed this crime is that okay no</text>
  <text start="1135.74" dur="7.2">it&amp;#39;s not the United States is making</text>
  <text start="1140.36" dur="4.68">excuses and listen I&amp;#39;m not against the</text>
  <text start="1142.94" dur="5.52">United States I&amp;#39;m against the government</text>
  <text start="1145.04" dur="7.74">I don&amp;#39;t like what they do I&amp;#39;m not for</text>
  <text start="1148.46" dur="7.29">Assad I&amp;#39;m not for Syria I&amp;#39;m just trying</text>
  <text start="1152.78" dur="6.33">to show different points and different</text>
  <text start="1155.75" dur="5.88">angles on the story so everyone sits</text>
  <text start="1159.11" dur="5.04">there and questions and asks more</text>
  <text start="1161.63" dur="7.32">questions and say well why why is that</text>
  <text start="1164.15" dur="7.38">and this is the whole point I remember</text>
  <text start="1168.95" dur="4.92">when President Obama was first taking</text>
  <text start="1171.53" dur="7.23">office saying that when he was going to</text>
  <text start="1173.87" dur="6.33">close Guantanamo and he said that you</text>
  <text start="1178.76" dur="4.32">know we have to be held to a higher</text>
  <text start="1180.2" dur="5.07">standard well guess what we&amp;#39;re not being</text>
  <text start="1183.08" dur="7.68">held to a higher standard we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1185.27" dur="10.74">the same damn thing that the CIA backed</text>
  <text start="1190.76" dur="9.2">al-qaeda people are doing so I the only</text>
  <text start="1196.01" dur="7.59">reason that that the US is doing this is</text>
  <text start="1199.96" dur="8.05">because the central bankers control them</text>
  <text start="1203.6" dur="5.58">and they need to continually push the US</text>
  <text start="1208.01" dur="4.53">dollar on</text>
  <text start="1209.18" dur="6.03">all the Middle East nations to use it as</text>
  <text start="1212.54" dur="5.43">the reserve currency and to capture all</text>
  <text start="1215.21" dur="5.91">the natural resources of the country</text>
  <text start="1217.97" dur="6.57">this is the only reason why we&amp;#39;re in any</text>
  <text start="1221.12" dur="6.45">of these countries this is why our women</text>
  <text start="1224.54" dur="7.44">and children are dying over there for</text>
  <text start="1227.57" dur="8.25">paper and ink it&amp;#39;s not for freedom it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1231.98" dur="7.8">not because they hate us it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1235.82" dur="9.24">these central bankers want their system</text>
  <text start="1239.78" dur="7.83">to go on but Iceland and hungry we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1245.06" dur="7.67">very smart they kicked the central</text>
  <text start="1247.61" dur="8.31">bankers out of their country now</text>
  <text start="1252.73" dur="4.96">Petraeus is out there calling on</text>
  <text start="1255.92" dur="3.33">Congress to back the White House now</text>
  <text start="1257.69" dur="4.55">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pulling out all the</text>
  <text start="1259.25" dur="6">stops right now to get this war started</text>
  <text start="1262.24" dur="6.22">right now less than ten percent of the</text>
  <text start="1265.25" dur="5.72">house support this war they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1268.46" dur="4.59">want it and in my previous report I said</text>
  <text start="1270.97" dur="4.63">that they were thinking about not even</text>
  <text start="1273.05" dur="4.92">voting because first of all only ten</text>
  <text start="1275.6" dur="4.98">percent will vote for it and what</text>
  <text start="1277.97" dur="7.76">they&amp;#39;re afraid of is that those people</text>
  <text start="1280.58" dur="9.57">who vote no will lose their backing from</text>
  <text start="1285.73" dur="7.57">certain sponsors that pay for their</text>
  <text start="1290.15" dur="4.59">campaigns and those who vote yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1293.3" dur="3.81">afraid that they won&amp;#39;t be reelected</text>
  <text start="1294.74" dur="5.37">because the people have spoken and they</text>
  <text start="1297.11" dur="5.36">do not want this war so what are they</text>
  <text start="1300.11" dur="9.39">doing well they have Dianne Feinstein</text>
  <text start="1302.47" dur="12.4">passing around this CIA a maid DVD that</text>
  <text start="1309.5" dur="8.04">shows a montage of people who are dead</text>
  <text start="1314.87" dur="5.43">from this chemical attack which shows</text>
  <text start="1317.54" dur="4.89">absolutely nothing that people are dead</text>
  <text start="1320.3" dur="4.95">and it doesn&amp;#39;t show who did it it</text>
  <text start="1322.43" dur="4.68">doesn&amp;#39;t show anything and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1325.25" dur="5.97">passing that around the Senate and the</text>
  <text start="1327.11" dur="6.12">house and most of the most of Congress</text>
  <text start="1331.22" dur="4.88">is saying well this brings up more</text>
  <text start="1333.23" dur="8.43">questions and they&amp;#39;re more skeptical and</text>
  <text start="1336.1" dur="6.97">this doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1341.66" dur="5.239">trying to build up</text>
  <text start="1343.07" dur="7.89">the propaganda that the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="1346.899" dur="7.66">used the gas without Assad permission</text>
  <text start="1350.96" dur="6.27">and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying to use every</text>
  <text start="1354.559" dur="6.72">single angle because Assad was on</text>
  <text start="1357.23" dur="6.84">Charlie Rose you know explaining that he</text>
  <text start="1361.279" dur="5.671">did not use any chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1364.07" dur="6.54">they are trying to pull out every single</text>
  <text start="1366.95" dur="5.91">angle to get this war started now Kerry</text>
  <text start="1370.61" dur="4.98">was being interviewed and there was a</text>
  <text start="1372.86" dur="5.309">question I&amp;#39;m just gonna paraphrase what</text>
  <text start="1375.59" dur="4.98">he said you know what what what could</text>
  <text start="1378.169" dur="5.521">stop this war what could stop the strike</text>
  <text start="1380.57" dur="6.059">and Kerry said well it is facade you</text>
  <text start="1383.69" dur="7.109">know gives up all his chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1386.629" dur="6.871">and you know let let&amp;#39;s uh you know and</text>
  <text start="1390.799" dur="6.571">removes them all and let the</text>
  <text start="1393.5" dur="5.94">international countries control it then</text>
  <text start="1397.37" dur="5.279">we wouldn&amp;#39;t do the strike so Russia</text>
  <text start="1399.44" dur="8.719">heard this and they said you know what</text>
  <text start="1402.649" dur="11.311">we will go to Syria and say listen let</text>
  <text start="1408.159" dur="10.841">the international countries control your</text>
  <text start="1413.96" dur="9.299">chemical weapons serious said okay that</text>
  <text start="1419" dur="8.7">sounds good it came back to the US and</text>
  <text start="1423.259" dur="10.05">now the you now the ball is in a in the</text>
  <text start="1427.7" dur="11.15">US court right now and they are trying</text>
  <text start="1433.309" dur="10.71">to figure out a way to still go to war</text>
  <text start="1438.85" dur="8.61">and they&amp;#39;re coming up with so many</text>
  <text start="1444.019" dur="8.15">different angles and so many different</text>
  <text start="1447.46" dur="7.48">schemes just to continue the war drums</text>
  <text start="1452.169" dur="6.46">there was a report out there saying and</text>
  <text start="1454.94" dur="7.8">you have to remember the u.s. really</text>
  <text start="1458.629" dur="7.351">doesn&amp;#39;t have evidence if it was such</text>
  <text start="1462.74" dur="11.01">great evidence they would have given it</text>
  <text start="1465.98" dur="10.4">to Cameron and he would have shown the</text>
  <text start="1473.75" dur="6.08">people in the united kingdom and</text>
  <text start="1476.38" dur="6.06">look at this evidence this shows Assad</text>
  <text start="1479.83" dur="5.7">used chemical weapons and they would</text>

  <text start="1673.76" dur="7.92">nothing to do with the Syrian problem</text>
  <text start="1678.17" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s going on right now turkey right</text>
  <text start="1681.68" dur="5.13">now is starting to build a new military</text>

  <text start="1706.16" dur="3.93">that soldiers have started to assemble</text>
  <text start="1707.6" dur="4.47">the equipment on top of the mountain so</text>
  <text start="1710.09" dur="5.34">basically what&amp;#39;s happening is that all</text>
  <text start="1712.07" dur="7.28">of these countries everyone is starting</text>
  <text start="1715.43" dur="7.65">to prepare for war which is coming and</text>
  <text start="1719.35" dur="6.37">again Russia urge Syria to hand over the</text>
  <text start="1723.08" dur="4.89">chemical weapons which they which to</text>
  <text start="1725.72" dur="5.07">international control to avoid a strike</text>
  <text start="1727.97" dur="5.88">Syria said okay and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1730.79" dur="5.52">right now is the United States plans to</text>
  <text start="1733.85" dur="4.29">follow up with Russia to see whether a</text>
  <text start="1736.31" dur="3.39">proposal for Syria to put its chemical</text>
  <text start="1738.14" dur="4.37">weapons under international control is</text>
  <text start="1739.7" dur="2.81">credible and</text>
  <text start="1743.43" dur="10.11">Carrie tells Lavrov that you know when</text>
  <text start="1748.8" dur="7.59">he made this for this I guess proposal</text>
  <text start="1753.54" dur="4.62">it really wasn&amp;#39;t a proposal it was</text>
  <text start="1756.39" dur="4.68">rhetorical and he really didn&amp;#39;t mean it</text>
  <text start="1758.16" dur="5.61">so basically Carrie kind of screwed</text>
  <text start="1761.07" dur="5.25">himself and the US government by saying</text>
  <text start="1763.77" dur="5.34">this is what they had to do and Russia</text>
  <text start="1766.32" dur="5.34">went ahead and did this and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1769.11" dur="6">trying to backpedal and try to say hey</text>
  <text start="1771.66" dur="5.97">whoa whoa we didn&amp;#39;t mean that and you</text>
  <text start="1775.11" dur="4.83">know to paraphrase Carrie to Syria turn</text>
  <text start="1777.63" dur="5.22">over your chemical weapons Syria to</text>
  <text start="1779.94" dur="5.22">carry okay Carrie to Syria I was being</text>
  <text start="1782.85" dur="6.06">rhetorical we will just bomb you anyway</text>
  <text start="1785.16" dur="8.25">and and and soon as we are done gassing</text>
  <text start="1788.91" dur="7.8">you so they are looking Carrie kind of</text>
  <text start="1793.41" dur="6.42">screwed up Carrie is trying to get</text>
  <text start="1796.71" dur="6.75">himself out of this the White House the</text>
  <text start="1799.83" dur="7.32">Obama administration is trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1803.46" dur="8.16">out a way of turning this around because</text>
  <text start="1807.15" dur="8.04">again they only want one thing and that</text>
  <text start="1811.62" dur="7.32">is war Susan Rice&amp;#39;s out there today</text>

  <text start="1831.54" dur="5.58">saying you have no evidence no one is</text>
  <text start="1833.91" dur="4.95">behind you right now and you need to</text>
  <text start="1837.12" dur="4.95">stop this right now because if you</text>
  <text start="1838.86" dur="10.58">attack a Syria that is an attack on a</text>

  <text start="1849.44" dur="5.65">saying we will work with the Russians</text>

  <text start="1855.09" dur="4.77">skepticism about the Assad regime&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1857.1" dur="6.48">credibility so while we&amp;#39;re having these</text>

  <text start="1868.68" dur="6.71">the war drums because I would be very</text>
  <text start="1871.53" dur="3.86">very surprised if</text>
  <text start="1875.47" dur="7.89">the Obama administration says okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1880.09" dur="4.8">going to give you this time and we will</text>
  <text start="1883.36" dur="4.38">put the chemical weapons under</text>
  <text start="1884.89" dur="5.399">international control and we will scale</text>
  <text start="1887.74" dur="4.71">down and we will not strike you have to</text>
  <text start="1890.289" dur="5.221">remember they&amp;#39;ve been planning this for</text>
  <text start="1892.45" dur="7.14">many many years this is the end game</text>

  <text start="1919.419" dur="4.561">no real evidence they&amp;#39;ll just keep on</text>
  <text start="1921.64" dur="4.56">hitting at home over and over and over</text>
  <text start="1923.98" dur="7.11">just like the corporate media but we</text>
  <text start="1926.2" dur="8.13">know that there is no real evidence we</text>
  <text start="1931.09" dur="5.61">should be having talks with Syria to</text>
  <text start="1934.33" dur="5.04">calm the situation down you would think</text>
  <text start="1936.7" dur="6.709">that would be the most logical course of</text>
  <text start="1939.37" dur="7.86">action make a deal like the Russians say</text>
  <text start="1943.409" dur="6.76">let the let international control the</text>
  <text start="1947.23" dur="6.96">chemical weapons let them take them and</text>
  <text start="1950.169" dur="5.971">remove them this way it diffuses the</text>
  <text start="1954.19" dur="5.16">whole problem there will be no more</text>
  <text start="1956.14" dur="5.88">chemical weapons attacks if we take all</text>
  <text start="1959.35" dur="6.329">the chemical weapons away but again they</text>
  <text start="1962.02" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t want that they want war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1965.679" dur="6.211">what they&amp;#39;re looking to do this is their</text>
  <text start="1967.33" dur="6.87">endgame they need to get in there now</text>
  <text start="1971.89" dur="8.909">there&amp;#39;s a report saying that al Qaeda is</text>
  <text start="1974.2" dur="8.729">growing and but what they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1980.799" dur="5.401">not growing in the way that everyone</text>
  <text start="1982.929" dur="5.821">thinks and it could become a very big</text>
  <text start="1986.2" dur="5.609">threat here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="1988.75" dur="7.86">what they&amp;#39;re saying is even though the</text>
  <text start="1991.809" dur="10.291">core of al Qaeda is declining al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1996.61" dur="9.53">ism is starting to attract new types of</text>

  <text start="2006.14" dur="5.93">extremists are in many ways</text>
  <text start="2008.92" dur="5.93">stronger position today than in the past</text>
  <text start="2012.07" dur="9.18">and this is why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="2014.85" dur="11.47">what&amp;#39;s happening now is that al-qaeda is</text>
  <text start="2021.25" dur="10.88">morphing al-qaeda is turning into lone</text>
  <text start="2026.32" dur="10.32">wolf terrorists where they can hit any</text>

  <text start="2041.86" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re much harder to keep track of so</text>
  <text start="2045.73" dur="8.22">the United States today has a bigger</text>

  <text start="2053.95" dur="9.81">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they are</text>
  <text start="2057.94" dur="9.15">building the false flags they are</text>
