  <text start="122.14" dur="3.209">grants from the government and they</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="3.45">basically do whatever the government</text>
  <text start="125.349" dur="4.05">wants and right now we can see the</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="5.64">consumer confidence coming from the</text>
  <text start="129.399" dur="5.73">conference board well it has surged to</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="5.07">one hundred and twenty five point six</text>
  <text start="135.129" dur="6.781">now we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="5.43">since 2000 and when you really look at</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="5.79">the consumer confidence it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="6.3">moving up as retail stores are closing</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="6.06">people are being laid off and real</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="6.96">earnings growth is declining but people</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="5.97">are very confident confident in what</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="5.28">well they see the stock market moving up</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="5.61">maybe they&amp;#39;re confident in that but real</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="4.5">earnings growth that&amp;#39;s declining retail</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="5">stores are closing</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="6">people are being laid off in retail and</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="5.259">when we look at the human confidence</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.459">well we see this divided between</text>
  <text start="175.599" dur="4.681">Democrats and Republicans Democrats well</text>
  <text start="178.359" dur="2.971">they&amp;#39;re expecting a deep recession</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.26">Republic</text>
  <text start="181.33" dur="6.71">well they&amp;#39;re expecting a new era of</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="6.6">robust economic growth but the last time</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="6.64">Americans felt this good about stocks</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="7.17">about the economy well the dot-com</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="6.78">bubble burst two months later and think</text>
  <text start="198.31" dur="5.19">about this back in 2008 when the stock</text>
  <text start="201.46" dur="3.93">market was hitting like 14,000 points</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="4.14">and people were feeling good what</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="4.56">happened later on remember that month of</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="6.27">August I believe it was August when we</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="5.25">had Obama and McCain and McCain was out</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="4.32">there trying to tell everyone that the</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="4.35">economy was fine yes Obama said he</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="3.27">doesn&amp;#39;t believe the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="219.55" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s pretty much what he said at that</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="4.92">point and then all of a sudden as we</text>
  <text start="223.84" dur="6.42">approached September and then we hit</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.57">October the market came down McCain boom</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="5.94">he had no clue he was not in touch with</text>
  <text start="232.99" dur="5.58">what the economy was doing they knew</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="5.01">Obama somehow knew that the economy</text>
  <text start="238.57" dur="5.88">wasn&amp;#39;t doing well and things were going</text>
  <text start="241.21" dur="4.86">to fall apart hmm very interesting that</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="3.36">pretty much got him into the White House</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="4.83">I mean there were other factors like</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="6.09">that but we had the stock market at</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="4.38">14,000 points the Fed told us everything</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.11">and then everything started to fall</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="5.519">apart very rapidly today we see the same</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="5.4">thing happening I mean Case Shiller came</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="4.411">out telling us that us home prices well</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.05">they have accelerated at its fastest</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="3.99">pace in three years and of course they</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="3.48">look at the 20 cities and they say yes</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="3.36">look at this we&amp;#39;re able to get these 20</text>
  <text start="270.94" dur="3.72">cities and were able to push the home</text>
  <text start="272.56" dur="4.17">prices up five by five point seven</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="5.34">percent now it&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="4.53">all of this again is that mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="280" dur="5.4">have been moving up a little bit</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="6.9">mortgage applications have been down but</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="5.85">prices are continually moving up Las</text>
  <text start="288.16" dur="4.41">Vegas siano San Diego they led the</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="3.3">monthly gains while Cleveland</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="5.4">Minneapolis in Detroit they saw a</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="4.86">slowdown San Francisco saw the biggest</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="4.44">drop in a year</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="5.88">now remember Case Shiller is reporting</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="5.43">on this a couple months back since that</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="5.629">time mortgage applications have declined</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="6.42">rates have popped up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="4.09">when you look outside of the 20 cities</text>
  <text start="314.26" dur="2.999">we are</text>
  <text start="315.009" dur="4.77">seeing that prices are coming down when</text>
  <text start="317.259" dur="4.11">I look around my area I can see there</text>
  <text start="319.779" dur="5.16">are homes that have been for sale for a</text>
  <text start="321.369" dur="5.58">very long time and guess what this past</text>
  <text start="324.939" dur="3.861">Sunday I was driving around and I saw</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="5.43">open houses all over the place and</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="5.709">nobody was showing up and when I look</text>
  <text start="332.379" dur="4.581">across the country I can see pretty much</text>
  <text start="334.509" dur="6.601">the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="7.72">Americans they have paid a record five</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="6">hundred and forty billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="4.769">property taxes to state and local</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="3.839">governments in the fiscal year of 2016</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="6.481">this is according to the US Census</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="7.59">Bureau this was up by 16 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="4.62">or about 3.2 percent from five hundred</text>
  <text start="358.539" dur="4.981">and twenty three billion in property</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="5.609">taxes back in 2015 so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="5.609">right now is that we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="366.159" dur="5.88">property taxes hit this height it hit a</text>
  <text start="369.129" dur="7.77">new level here and we saw it back in</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="7.68">2009 when they hit 527 billion so right</text>
  <text start="376.899" dur="6.841">now property taxes are about thirteen</text>
  <text start="379.719" dur="6.6">billion dollars higher than they were at</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="5.399">the Great Recession period of time and</text>
  <text start="386.319" dur="6.93">we can see that everything is reaching</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="5.911">that height level once again and when we</text>
  <text start="393.249" dur="4.59">look around we can see there are major</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="4.919">problems in the economy look at New York</text>
  <text start="397.839" dur="5.25">City retail vacancies for instance and</text>
  <text start="399.969" dur="4.56">if you walk around Soho and you used to</text>
  <text start="403.089" dur="3.901">walk around Soho and you see you know</text>
  <text start="404.529" dur="4.53">dozen upstart trendy fashion retailers</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="5.31">and you&amp;#39;d see all these different stores</text>
  <text start="409.059" dur="5.82">but today what do you see well you see a</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="5.519">lot of vacancies you see a retail</text>
  <text start="414.879" dur="5.07">drought and commercial landlords well</text>
  <text start="417.819" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve seen retail occupancy levels</text>
  <text start="419.949" dur="4.351">plummet over the last 12 months and</text>
  <text start="421.899" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re doing everything possible to</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="5.07">avoid big price cuts instead like</text>
  <text start="427.209" dur="3.93">residential landlords commercial real</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="4.229">estate owners well they&amp;#39;re providing</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="4.14">massive rent concessions through things</text>
  <text start="433.599" dur="3.69">like interior redesigns</text>
  <text start="435.279" dur="4.081">moving expenses to keep storefronts from</text>
  <text start="437.289" dur="4.23">going empty we&amp;#39;re seeing tenant</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="5.19">improvement in concession packages that</text>
  <text start="441.519" dur="7.301">retail landlords never ever contemplated</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.55">before and 5th Avenue stores well</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="4.41">that is on the rise and they are going</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="6.02">empty right now the space availability</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="6.96">right now is increasing in New York and</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="5.86">again as more and more of these retail</text>
  <text start="460.19" dur="4.67">shops closed down across the country pay</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="4.41">less Sears</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="5.44">RadioShack we&amp;#39;re gonna have a lot of</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="5.97">space that it will be opening up and we</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="5.97">already have a glut of retail space and</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s just getting worse we see more</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="5.1">signs of a weakening economy the Census</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="4.68">Bureau advanced economic reports show</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="5.07">that host sale and retail inventories</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="5.67">each Rove&amp;#39;s by 0.4 percent this</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="5.37">inventory build will likely add a couple</text>
  <text start="489.38" dur="4.74">of ticks to GDP estimates but sales</text>
  <text start="491.81" dur="4.14">really haven&amp;#39;t matched it the trade</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="5.25">deficit shrank in February but not</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="5.55">because of export strength but because</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="4.56">of both exports and imports were</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="5.19">negative for the month and imports fell</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="5.07">less and we see right now the decline in</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.53">imports well it adds to the weakening</text>
  <text start="509" dur="3.93">consumer spending outlook especially</text>
  <text start="511.22" dur="5.28">with the auto sector already rolling</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="4.95">over so things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="516.5" dur="4.47">things are not getting better</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="5.31">things aren&amp;#39;t improving actually what</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re seeing is things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="3.66">now Charles Hughes Smith he wrote an</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="4.26">article the overlapping crises are</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="3.18">coming regardless of who&amp;#39;s in power</text>
  <text start="529.46" dur="4.14">right now</text>
  <text start="530.03" dur="6.42">and Timothy Geithner well he conceded</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="4.71">that in his recent foreign affairs</text>

  <text start="555.23" dur="5.94">little left for the next crisis and I</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="6.54">don&amp;#39;t like doing this but I have to</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="5.94">agree with Tim Geithner on this that it</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="5.07">looks like the central banks they have</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="5.25">nothing left to shoot off they have no</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="5.52">more grenades they have no more bullets</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="4.71">and we can see that the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="3.33">they are raising the rates which is a</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="4.44">signal to let you know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.78" dur="3.45">preparing to bring this entire system</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="2.76">down</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="3.99">we see there is top Republicans out</text>
  <text start="584.27" dur="4.77">there saying that a government shutdown</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="5.04">is a real possibility and Wall Street</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="4.29">might not be prepared for this and we</text>
  <text start="591.26" dur="4.05">know that is coming up because once we</text>
  <text start="593.33" dur="4.05">hit the 20 trillion and it looks like</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s going to hit around maybe April</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="5.07">28th around that time period and we can</text>
  <text start="600.05" dur="4.41">see that there&amp;#39;s going to be a battle</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="4.32">look what happened with the healthcare</text>
  <text start="604.46" dur="4.59">battle there&amp;#39;s going to be a battle with</text>
  <text start="606.77" dur="4.41">the debt ceiling and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="4.74">how this all plays out because right now</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="5.13">the Democrats they feel empowered right</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="4.56">now where they&amp;#39;re saying look we still</text>
  <text start="616.31" dur="4.68">have Obamacare the debt ceiling is</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="5.22">coming up next let&amp;#39;s not make it easy</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="5.1">for Trump and we can see that the deep</text>
  <text start="623.57" dur="4.77">state their entire mission is to make</text>
  <text start="626.09" dur="5.19">sure that their system collapses by</text>
  <text start="628.34" dur="6.29">shutting down the government well they</text>
  <text start="631.28" dur="6.03">just have another method of really</text>
  <text start="634.63" dur="5.74">twisting all of this and putting a lot</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="6.96">of pressure on the economy to bring it</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="6.87">down now we know when Ron Paul was in</text>
  <text start="644.27" dur="5.43">office he kept on pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="4.89">we need to audit the and he continually</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="4.71">pushed this and his son Rand Paul well</text>
  <text start="652.13" dur="4.98">he is also pushing this now we know</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="6">there was a bill floating around to look</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="6.51">into the secret dealings of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="660.41" dur="5.7">we can see right now that the US House</text>
  <text start="663.62" dur="4.68">committee well they approved a bill to</text>
  <text start="666.11" dur="3.75">go in and audit the Fed now does this</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="5.55">mean they can go in and order the Fed</text>
  <text start="669.86" dur="6.77">right now no but we do know that the</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="6.57">entire house it&amp;#39;s made up mostly of</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="6.7">Republicans they control it and they</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="7.02">might move this bill forward because we</text>
  <text start="683.33" dur="7.8">understand that the next phase is for</text>
  <text start="687.44" dur="5.37">the entire floor to vote on it now there</text>
  <text start="691.13" dur="4.26">are certain individuals in government</text>
  <text start="692.81" dur="4.95">that do not want this to happen and</text>
  <text start="695.39" dur="3.9">these individuals are the pawns of the</text>
  <text start="697.76" dur="3.81">deep state of the central bank they</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t want an audit of the Fed they</text>
  <text start="701.57" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t want anyone looking into the</text>
  <text start="703.88" dur="4.53">secret inner workings of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.4" dur="3.81">actually doing remember the Fed is a</text>
  <text start="708.41" dur="3">separate corporation it&amp;#39;s not part of</text>
  <text start="710.21" dur="3.54">the government they have their own</text>
  <text start="711.41" dur="4.21">mandate their own secret mandate which</text>
  <text start="713.75" dur="3.7">really nobody knows about of</text>
  <text start="715.62" dur="4.29">what their whole entire purpose is about</text>
  <text start="717.45" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s not about the people it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="5.25">balancing the budget it&amp;#39;s not keeping</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="5.16">the currency out there and circulated</text>
  <text start="725.16" dur="4.29">has nothing to do with that because if</text>
  <text start="727.38" dur="5.01">they truly were working for the people</text>
  <text start="729.45" dur="5.73">why attach interest there&amp;#39;d be no reason</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="5.04">to do it so at this point we can see the</text>
  <text start="735.18" dur="4.47">founding fathers well they didn&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="737.43" dur="6.06">private central bank actually Andrew</text>
  <text start="739.65" dur="5.91">Jackson his entire campaign was to get</text>
  <text start="743.49" dur="4.41">rid of the central bank and he did and</text>
  <text start="745.56" dur="4.41">of course they tried to assassinate him</text>
  <text start="747.9" dur="3.24">this is what the central banks do when</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="3.09">they don&amp;#39;t get their way they try to</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="3.93">kill that individual but it was too late</text>
  <text start="753.06" dur="5.01">because he got rid of them their</text>
  <text start="755.07" dur="4.5">assassination attempt failed and we can</text>
  <text start="758.07" dur="3.92">see right now that Trump does have that</text>
  <text start="759.57" dur="5.19">portrait hanging in his office and we</text>
  <text start="761.99" dur="5.08">can see right now there are many</text>
  <text start="764.76" dur="4.019">individuals these pawns of the central</text>
  <text start="767.07" dur="4.38">bank and think about it why are they</text>
  <text start="768.779" dur="5.341">defending the central bank what benefit</text>
  <text start="771.45" dur="4.59">does it give them are they receiving</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="5.34">funds in a certain way</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="5.37">are they being you know compensated for</text>
  <text start="779.46" dur="4.68">doing the work of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="781.41" dur="5.549">protecting them in Congress well of</text>
  <text start="784.14" dur="5.49">course because what other benefit is</text>
  <text start="786.959" dur="4.741">there there is no other benefit to the</text>
  <text start="789.63" dur="4.14">central bank and we could see around the</text>
  <text start="791.7" dur="3.9">world if their mandate was to keep</text>
  <text start="793.77" dur="3.87">everything at status quo and make sure</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="4.29">that all the countries are doing well</text>
  <text start="797.64" dur="5.1">why are the all these countries in so</text>
  <text start="799.89" dur="5.91">much debt why do we have 20 trillion</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="6.36">dollars worth of debt why do we have 200</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="5.37">trillion of unfunded liability why do</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="4.8">they keep giving debt to countries and</text>
  <text start="811.17" dur="4.859">making the people pay for it think about</text>
  <text start="813.9" dur="4.89">all of it now are they going to be able</text>
  <text start="816.029" dur="4.531">to audit the Fed will it get that far</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="4.32">no the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="820.56" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re pretty powerful and we know for</text>
  <text start="823.11" dur="6.33">a very long time they do not want to be</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="5.13">audited they believe that it&amp;#39;s none of</text>
  <text start="829.44" dur="4.53">the people&amp;#39;s business</text>
  <text start="831.24" dur="4.74">really we the people it&amp;#39;s none of our</text>
  <text start="833.97" dur="6.27">business how the currency of this</text>
  <text start="835.98" dur="6.69">country is working and what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="840.24" dur="4.86">actually doing now the books they give</text>
  <text start="842.67" dur="4.23">to Congress saying this is more audit</text>
  <text start="845.1" dur="3.93">those aren&amp;#39;t the books we want to look</text>
  <text start="846.9" dur="4.83">at we want to look at the other book</text>
  <text start="849.03" dur="4.62">that they have the other accounting that</text>
  <text start="851.73" dur="4.5">they have we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in</text>
  <text start="853.65" dur="5.04">companies actually where they give one</text>
  <text start="856.23" dur="4.23">set of books and say look everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.69" dur="4.59">on the up-and-up and in the background</text>
  <text start="860.46" dur="5.16">they keep the other set what with which</text>
  <text start="863.28" dur="2.88">what they&amp;#39;re really doing and we can see</text>
  <text start="865.62" dur="2.76">right now</text>
  <text start="866.16" dur="4.95">there are individuals that are going to</text>
  <text start="868.38" dur="6.36">try to stop this they don&amp;#39;t want the Fed</text>
  <text start="871.11" dur="5.97">audit it because if the Fed was audited</text>
  <text start="874.74" dur="5.85">this would be one of the biggest truth</text>
  <text start="877.08" dur="6.24">bombs to hit the public and it would be</text>
  <text start="880.59" dur="5.73">a complete disaster for that central</text>
  <text start="883.32" dur="6.69">banking system not just the Fed but the</text>

  <text start="890.01" dur="4.68">whole entire central bank system would</text>
  <text start="892.14" dur="6.21">implode on itself because the entire</text>
  <text start="894.69" dur="7.17">world would see exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="6.42">doing and what their mandate is and how</text>
  <text start="901.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been lying to governments to the</text>
  <text start="904.77" dur="5.1">people it would be a disaster this is</text>
  <text start="907.11" dur="7.32">why it&amp;#39;s been how many years now since</text>
