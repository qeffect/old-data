  <text start="260.91" dur="6.81">rid of much as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="5.76">and they&amp;#39;re setting it up the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="4.379">is one part of it</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="8.16">tariffs with China are another part of</text>
  <text start="272.099" dur="8.88">it getting rid of the WTO that is</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.36">another part of it and you could see</text>
  <text start="280.979" dur="3.881">with what Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="5.23">doing</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.63">they decided that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.73">have a WTO appeals court we discussed</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="4.56">this yesterday what does this allow</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="6.24">Trump to do</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="7.98">he can now impose tariffs on countries</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="6.75">the WTO what are they gonna do about</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="7.95">countries can&amp;#39;t appeal this is all being</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="6.87">done on purpose and then of course we</text>
  <text start="311.98" dur="5.16">have China so they&amp;#39;re gonna have to move</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="6.3">to plan B what&amp;#39;s plan B</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="6.66">and it seems that plan B is since</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re making deals with Europe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="9.11">gonna be using Europe&amp;#39;s international</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="9.56">trade system so no longer is the WTO</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="7.87">going to handle trade disputes Europe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="5.02">international trade court system is</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="6.99">going to handle this now does that</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="7.95">affect the United States no remember the</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="8.1">World Trade Organization handled the</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="8.79">world Trump doesn&amp;#39;t want a centralized</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="6.72">body handling all of this he likes</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="6.69">bilateral trade he likes dealing with</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="6.09">countries one on one one trade be it one</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="6.32">trade deal goes bad the other one is</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="7.34">fine if you look at the UK for instance</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="7.18">they really need to go through the EU</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="5.41">once they break apart from the EU they</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="5.28">can make all the bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="6.54">agreements they want this is the storm</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="6.24">that Trump and the Patriots are setting</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="7.08">up right now they&amp;#39;re positioning</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="6.36">themselves to hit the globalists really</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="5.82">hard why do you think of the UN Trump is</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="8.28">out there saying that there is no future</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="9.13">for the globalist system</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="7.06">because the new economic system will not</text>
  <text start="410" dur="6.41">support their globalist system and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="6.75">dismantling it one piece at a time and</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="4.87">this all has to be done because</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="5.28">eventually what Trump is going to do</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="8.699">he&amp;#39;s going to strike at the heart of the</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="9.389">entire economic system and that is the</text>
  <text start="429.979" dur="8.581">global economic system remember going</text>
  <text start="434.509" dur="5.34">back to 1913 actually before 1913 and we</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="3.96">know that Trump has an interjection</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="5.341">hanging on some wall when Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="7.739">was in office he didn&amp;#39;t have to deal</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="7.199">with the IMF the biz the ECB all these</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="5.071">different central banks around the world</text>
  <text start="452.389" dur="5.581">he was only dealing with the central</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="5.28">bank system in the United States and</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="6">that was tough enough they tried to get</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="7.5">rid of him actually they tried to</text>
  <text start="463.97" dur="6.75">assassinate him but he eventually he got</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="6.27">rid of the central bank system today</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="8.6">Trump has a much larger job because</text>
  <text start="474.38" dur="8.55">since 1913 the central bank apparatus</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="7.45">the octopus has its tentacles in</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="5.58">everything the IMF the biz the ECB all</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="4.829">the privates and central bank systems</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="8.01">around the world the Rothschilds it all</text>
  <text start="491.599" dur="8.641">is now one gigantic octopus with</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="5.94">tentacles everywhere and I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="2.519">that Trump and the Patriots can do this</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="2.04">alone</text>
  <text start="502.759" dur="5.641">I do believe they&amp;#39;re working with other</text>
  <text start="504.5" dur="6.63">countries to help and one being Russia</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="4.8">I believe China is also working with</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="4.949">Trump now remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="5.759">system still has control of many of</text>
  <text start="516.079" dur="4.59">these countries Russia actually took</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="3.901">control of their private western central</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="5.641">bank this is why the deep state the</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="7.07">central bank hates Russia so much and I</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="5.76">do believe that the central bank</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="4.779">establishment they were going to use</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="4.98">China to shift everything away from the</text>
  <text start="534.709" dur="3.601">center from the United States and I do</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="4.889">believe</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="7.019">China is in line with Russia and Trump</text>
  <text start="541.939" dur="4.59">is in line with Russia and China to work</text>
  <text start="545.329" dur="3.091">together and I believe there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="4.951">little countries around that are working</text>
  <text start="548.42" dur="5.13">with Trump also I do believe Boris</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="5.849">Johnson is going to fall into this mix</text>
  <text start="553.55" dur="6.24">once the brexit happens I do believe</text>
  <text start="557.329" dur="5.76">that this is going to take a world</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="7.019">effort to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="6.36">system it&amp;#39;s not as easy as Andrew</text>
  <text start="566.809" dur="6.63">Jackson and first Trump needs to get rid</text>
  <text start="569.449" dur="6.471">of all the blocks every everything</text>
  <text start="573.439" dur="5.491">that&amp;#39;s trying to take him down and</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="6.639">remember this is the swamp it&amp;#39;s deep</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="8">it&amp;#39;s wide it&amp;#39;s elected it&amp;#39;s non elected</text>
  <text start="582.559" dur="8.551">it&amp;#39;s just paid employees you name it</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="8.889">they&amp;#39;re all trying to take down Trump</text>
  <text start="591.11" dur="7.38">and he needs to remove all of this so he</text>
  <text start="595.819" dur="5.851">can move forward that is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.49" dur="5.789">doing right now and this is why I keep</text>
  <text start="601.67" dur="5.37">saying this is a perfect storm the</text>
  <text start="604.279" dur="5.011">perfect storm is not just about getting</text>
  <text start="607.04" dur="6.539">rid of the deep state the perfect storm</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="8.539">includes the economic storm it includes</text>
  <text start="613.579" dur="7.531">it all and notice the timing of all this</text>
  <text start="617.829" dur="6.01">how everything is happening pretty much</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="7.11">at the same time as blocks are removed</text>
  <text start="623.839" dur="7.74">as more evidence is put out there Trump</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="9">goes ahead and he starts hitting at</text>
  <text start="631.579" dur="8.461">certain economic institutions removing</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="6.479">their power because this is a</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="5.7">coordinated effort and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.699" dur="4.771">going to happen is once all the blocks</text>
  <text start="645.74" dur="6.329">and everything is gone Trump will then</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="5.88">make his move on the central bank most</text>
  <text start="652.069" dur="4.74">likely he&amp;#39;ll start here in the United</text>
  <text start="654.35" dur="5.07">States with the Federal Reserve and they</text>
  <text start="656.809" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t move outward to other central bank</text>
  <text start="659.42" dur="3.779">system now it could happen</text>
  <text start="660.529" dur="5.631">another way but from what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="663.199" dur="7.221">right now where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="7.69">calling out the Fed it looks like</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="7.66">eventually once he can place people on</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="6.75">the board restructure the Fed once the</text>
  <text start="678.08" dur="5.9">Fed is restructured they can start</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="6.23">dismantling they could start moving away</text>
  <text start="683.98" dur="6.729">from the central bank system and</text>
  <text start="686.83" dur="6.31">remember the entire world depends on the</text>
  <text start="690.709" dur="4.741">Federal Reserve right now and I believe</text>
  <text start="693.14" dur="4.17">this is the beginning stages and there</text>
  <text start="695.45" dur="4.53">will be like a domino effect where other</text>
  <text start="697.31" dur="5.58">countries will join in where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="5.58">turn against their private ones central</text>
  <text start="702.89" dur="5.25">bank systems where they&amp;#39;ll take control</text>
  <text start="705.56" dur="7.26">of the privatizing central banking</text>
  <text start="708.14" dur="8.94">systems this is coming the economic</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="7.079">storm is coming it&amp;#39;s all part of this</text>
