  <text start="156.23" dur="9.3">an economic show we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="7.36">the audience we are watching the Central</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="6.96">Bank and the Trump administration the</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="6.72">Patriots perform this show this battle</text>
  <text start="172.49" dur="4.44">of who is going to win in the end</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="4.32">now the central bank they&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="176.93" dur="4.26">power for quite a while this is going</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="4.38">back thousands of years this is not just</text>
  <text start="181.19" dur="5.31">here in the US but in the u.s. they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="4.26">been in power since 1913 we need to</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="3.6">remember that there were two other</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="5.61">central banks in the United States</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="7.109">Andrew Jackson ran on the platform of</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="7.59">getting rid of the central bank and we</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="6.301">had no central bank until 1913 but the</text>
  <text start="201.32" dur="5.389">central bank&amp;#39;s plan has always been the</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="6.69">same put every single country into debt</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="6.841">make them subservient to the central</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="6.75">bank control them make them pass laws</text>
  <text start="213.55" dur="6.46">then push them into war and restart the</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="6.33">entire system we&amp;#39;re at the end phase</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="5.28">right now and at this end phase</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="4.95">the central bank thought they had the</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="7.68">upper hand they thought that everything</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="6.72">was going as planned now it&amp;#39;s not so</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.75">even for the deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve always had to deviate from plans</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="5.56">but they&amp;#39;ve always tried to reach their</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="5.13">goal that means the central bank those</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="5.01">in the deep state they&amp;#39;re still not</text>
  <text start="246.11" dur="5.79">going to give up but what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="7.14">right now is this gigantic show this</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="7.26">battle between these groups and one of</text>
  <text start="256.43" dur="5.339">the groups is we the people the other is</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="6.54">the unelected officials the central bank</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="6.781">is an unelected official dictating to</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="5.219">countries so what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="4.619">well we&amp;#39;re at the end stage how do we</text>
  <text start="270.919" dur="5.011">know we&amp;#39;re at the end stage because when</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="7.981">we reach the end stage the debt levels</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="8.58">cannot be sustained people cannot live</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="5.99">on what they are making there are no</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="5.85">jobs wages</text>
  <text start="287.14" dur="4.99">flatline or decline they might bump up a</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="2.769">little bit but that&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="4.059">short-lived</text>
  <text start="293.129" dur="8.07">then we see inflation where the dollar</text>
  <text start="296.189" dur="7.77">loses its value and items there out of</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="7.56">reach for many and then as time goes on</text>
  <text start="303.959" dur="7.651">many more and to fight this to hide this</text>
  <text start="308.759" dur="5.25">what if corporations been doing they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="6.179">been shrinking items they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="314.009" dur="5.34">replacing ingredients replacing a lot of</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="5.55">the components of many different</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="6.57">products to keep the price down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.339" dur="4.56">actually not keeping the price down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="4.26">the value of the dollar that&amp;#39;s losing</text>
  <text start="327.899" dur="5.19">its value so you need more of them to</text>
  <text start="330.179" dur="5.04">purchase the same thing so they go out</text>
  <text start="333.089" dur="4.35">and they purchase you know less</text>
  <text start="335.219" dur="4.92">expensive ingredients which cause less</text>
  <text start="337.439" dur="4.29">dollars and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="4.59">hide all this or they shrink the</text>
  <text start="341.729" dur="5.93">packaging which we&amp;#39;ve seen in ice cream</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="7.71">and crackers and many other products</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="9.37">right now consumers they are using</text>
  <text start="352.439" dur="7.62">plastic they&amp;#39;re using credit consumer</text>
  <text start="357.029" dur="5.07">debt has jumped to four point nine</text>
  <text start="360.059" dur="5.61">percent in the third quarter compared to</text>
  <text start="362.099" dur="5.701">the third quarter last year so it is up</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="6.39">by a hundred and eighty two billion to</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="6.779">almost four trillion dollars why did</text>
  <text start="372.059" dur="4.98">they have to introduce credit why did</text>
  <text start="374.579" dur="4.98">they have to introduce car loans because</text>
  <text start="377.039" dur="5.37">of this as the dollar loses its value</text>
  <text start="379.559" dur="6.36">this is the only way people can purchase</text>
  <text start="382.409" dur="6">items same thing with colleges same</text>
  <text start="385.919" dur="5.16">thing with homes and you have to then</text>
  <text start="388.409" dur="5.22">extend the terms then you have to reduce</text>
  <text start="391.079" dur="5.01">the rates then you have to say no</text>
  <text start="393.629" dur="3.69">downpayment think about what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="3.51">here think of an automobile</text>
  <text start="397.319" dur="5.91">when automobiles first came out really</text>
  <text start="399.599" dur="7.41">people put them in cash then they moved</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="6.62">to financing when the dollar lost even</text>
  <text start="407.009" dur="6.66">more value they moved to leasing now</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="4.99">it&amp;#39;s like shared renting well if you</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="3.35">only need the car on Tuesday and</text>
  <text start="414.839" dur="5.13">Wednesday you only pay for that time</text>
  <text start="417.019" dur="4.57">this is because the system is breaking</text>
  <text start="419.969" dur="4.561">down it&amp;#39;s not because it&amp;#39;s improving</text>
  <text start="421.589" dur="5.401">it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s breaking down</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="4.08">now consumer debt and includes credit</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="4.05">card debt auto loans and student loans</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="5.82">but but it does not include mortgage</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="5.43">related debt and we can see from 2008</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="4.98">where it was at two point six four</text>
  <text start="436.47" dur="5.67">trillion we are now at three point nine</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="5">three trillion what do you think this</text>
  <text start="442.14" dur="7.11">means for the everyday person it means</text>
  <text start="444.41" dur="8.14">they&amp;#39;re a slave to the credit card if</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="4.83">you take away the credit card I would</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="3.9">say the majority the people will not be</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="4.53">able to live they would not be able to</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="6.03">make ends meet and they&amp;#39;re barely doing</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="7.26">it right now on auto loans we see leases</text>
  <text start="462.48" dur="6.09">on new and used vehicles they jump by 41</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="6.03">billion from a year ago or they went up</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="6.36">by 3.7 percent to a record 1.1 1</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="7.08">trillion so if we look at debt if we</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="7.35">look at personal debt auto debt student</text>
  <text start="478.98" dur="5.49">loan debt government debt if you notice</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="5.94">all the debts rising it&amp;#39;s not shrinking</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="5.28">and that means the system is coming to</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="3.09">an end because all of this will not be</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="4.44">sustained all these people that are</text>
  <text start="491.31" dur="5.1">continually putting their purchases on</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="3.15">credit it&amp;#39;s become it&amp;#39;s going to become</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="4.62">very very difficult</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="6">now this holiday season they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="501.03" dur="3.9">make the claim that oh wow look sales</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="4.2">are incredible but think about what</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="3.45">happened here how did they have to make</text>
  <text start="507.54" dur="5.549">this happen</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="6.539">well they adjusted the FICO score more</text>
  <text start="513.089" dur="4.411">people will get credit cards and when</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="5.401">they report sales are fantastic no that</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="5.039">just means more people went into debt I</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="4.86">mean they&amp;#39;re feeling good they think the</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="4.261">economy is doing well so they charge it</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="4.44">thinking that times are going to get a</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="4.05">lot better because now they just got a</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="4.2">brand new credit card because their</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="4.83">credit score is a lot better but what</text>
  <text start="533.82" dur="4.62">they did was they just dug the hole a</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="3.15">little bit deeper so is everything a lot</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="3.69">better</text>
  <text start="538.83" dur="6.45">no it just gets worse and worse actually</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="7.32">Americans they&amp;#39;re taking out roughly 50</text>
  <text start="545.28" dur="7.559">billion in payday loans each year why</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="6.509">are they doing this because people</text>
  <text start="552.839" dur="5.401">cannot make ends meet they&amp;#39;re unable to</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="2.551">come up with cash to cover it unexpected</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="3.72">fun</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="8.28">emergency and they&amp;#39;re living paycheck to</text>
  <text start="561.96" dur="6.54">paycheck and payday lenders well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="3.3">making a fortune off of this because of</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="4.98">the interest and the fees and everything</text>
  <text start="570.09" dur="5.94">else actually in the housing market</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="4.92">we see that there&amp;#39;s a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="4.53">DR Horton which is the largest u.s. home</text>
  <text start="578.4" dur="5.66">builder they&amp;#39;re out there saying that</text>
  <text start="580.56" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re having a problem in new homes</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="6.76">because of the rates they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="7.7">moving up because of the prices people</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="5.85">are shying away from buying a new home</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="4.99">and they&amp;#39;re very worried about this</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="3.84">because sales are going to decline</text>
  <text start="599.31" dur="4.14">actually they have already started to</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="5.49">decline and Peter Schiff said something</text>
  <text start="603.45" dur="5.61">very interesting he says that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="606" dur="4.53">have a booming economy and of course</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s not the only one notice we all</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="4.98">noticed this a while back because really</text>
  <text start="612.51" dur="4.77">nothing&amp;#39;s really changed here all they</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="4.44">did was manipulate the numbers this is</text>
  <text start="617.28" dur="4.05">all being done on purpose I mean think</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="3">about what Trump said before he was</text>
  <text start="621.33" dur="4.92">president he knew that these were all</text>
  <text start="622.95" dur="5.76">bubbles so why now is he saying that the</text>
  <text start="626.25" dur="4.86">economy is doing fantastic using the</text>
  <text start="628.71" dur="5.49">same exact calculations and everything</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="9">that Obama did because he&amp;#39;s playing the</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="7.71">game it&amp;#39;s a show and if the economy was</text>
  <text start="640.11" dur="3.54">declining and he didn&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="6">anything and everything was falling</text>
  <text start="643.65" dur="8.1">apart guess what it would all be blamed</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="5.88">on him he turned the tables on them so</text>
  <text start="651.75" dur="3.36">this way when the system comes down and</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="3.3">of course this is why he&amp;#39;s pointing the</text>
  <text start="655.11" dur="4.22">finger at the Fed he&amp;#39;s letting everyone</text>
  <text start="657.09" dur="6.45">know that the Fed is going to do this</text>
  <text start="659.33" dur="7.48">he&amp;#39;s changed the game but this is a show</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="5.4">and Schiff says that jobs are just one</text>
  <text start="666.81" dur="4.62">more bubble that&amp;#39;s about to burst</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="4.32">he said 200,000 jobs a month in an</text>
  <text start="671.43" dur="4.59">economy the size of ours especially</text>
  <text start="673.26" dur="4.14">given how few people or what a large</text>
  <text start="676.02" dur="3.42">percentage of the workforce is not</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="4.68">working we should be creating a lot more</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="5.13">than 200,000 jobs per month but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.08" dur="4.38">not even though wages are rising for</text>
  <text start="684.57" dur="3.9">people that have jobs the cost of living</text>
  <text start="686.46" dur="4.2">is rising faster but the cost of</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="3.79">servicing their debt is riving rising</text>
  <text start="690.66" dur="5.14">even faster than that</text>
  <text start="692.26" dur="5.13">and as far as the job growth goes the</text>
  <text start="695.8" dur="4.05">mainstream keeps pointing to it as a</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="5.1">sign of a booming economy but as Peter</text>
  <text start="699.85" dur="5.37">points out we&amp;#39;re borrowing a tremendous</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="5.85">amount of money to get this jobs growth</text>
  <text start="705.22" dur="7.8">and this has been going on for quite a</text>
  <text start="708.34" dur="6.6">while now the whole plan is to gradually</text>
  <text start="713.02" dur="4.53">raise the interest rates now things have</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="5.43">changed since Trump came into office the</text>
  <text start="717.55" dur="5.1">Fed which was controlled by the deep</text>
  <text start="720.37" dur="5.79">state at the time they were planning to</text>
  <text start="722.65" dur="4.98">do this and use this against Trump this</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="3.3">is why they started raising the rates</text>
  <text start="727.63" dur="4.14">right before Trump came into office and</text>
  <text start="729.46" dur="4.77">right after he got into office because</text>
  <text start="731.77" dur="4.26">they were ready to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="734.23" dur="3.75">they wanted him to be in office for a</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="4.32">year year and a half and this way he can</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="4.26">say this is my economy it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="3.63">well but it&amp;#39;s gonna do a lot better the</text>
  <text start="742.24" dur="3.3">Fed was gonna be raising rates the</text>
  <text start="743.98" dur="3.15">economy was gonna be deteriorating at</text>
  <text start="745.54" dur="3.54">the same time they were gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="4.95">blame it all on him he switched the</text>
  <text start="749.08" dur="4.29">tables he switched everything around now</text>
  <text start="752.08" dur="3.2">the Fed is raising rates and the</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="5.31">economy&amp;#39;s getting better</text>
  <text start="755.28" dur="5.98">hmm Trump is pointing to the Fed saying</text>
  <text start="758.68" dur="6.42">that they will be responsible if the</text>
  <text start="761.26" dur="6.81">economy implodes telling us that I</text>
  <text start="765.1" dur="6.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t raise rates the way the Fed is</text>
  <text start="768.07" dur="7.59">right now it makes no sense so he knows</text>
  <text start="772" dur="5.07">exactly what is happening here and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.66" dur="2.49">preparing the narrative and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="777.07" dur="2.58">talking about this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="778.15" dur="4.38">actually the Fed had their meeting today</text>
  <text start="779.65" dur="5.4">and guess what everything is still on</text>
  <text start="782.53" dur="4.56">track yes we&amp;#39;re gonna raise the rates</text>
  <text start="785.05" dur="3.84">gradually and we&amp;#39;re gonna do it</text>
  <text start="787.09" dur="4.2">throughout next year now remember when</text>
  <text start="788.89" dur="5.52">we hit a certain point and everyone</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="4.71">saying this magic numbers around 3% most</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="3.18">likely we&amp;#39;re gonna hit this in the</text>
  <text start="796" dur="3.69">middle of 2019 this is when everything</text>
  <text start="797.59" dur="3.87">starts to really really fall apart we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.69" dur="4.08">seeing it now but it&amp;#39;s gonna get a lot</text>
  <text start="801.46" dur="3.9">worse once we hit that magic number</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="2.82">we&amp;#39;re going to see everything start to</text>
  <text start="805.36" dur="4.23">fall apart now is it gonna happen</text>
  <text start="806.59" dur="4.89">exactly and on that date no but once</text>
  <text start="809.59" dur="6.09">that does happen everything will</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="6.18">accelerate just like we saw back in 2006</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="4.26">going into 2007 they hit the magic</text>
  <text start="817.66" dur="4.58">number and then boom they drop the rates</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="4.53">like an elevator falling down the shaft</text>
  <text start="822.24" dur="3.7">the same thing is going to happen now</text>
  <text start="824.47" dur="3.51">but are they gonna</text>
  <text start="825.94" dur="6">drop the rates once again maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="8.25">not because the whole push is to really</text>
  <text start="831.94" dur="6.81">bring down this entire system that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="836.23" dur="4.44">real push and we&amp;#39;re gonna be entering</text>
  <text start="838.75" dur="3.93">the finale right now because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.67" dur="6.57">headed towards the end of this year and</text>
  <text start="842.68" dur="8.76">we&amp;#39;re heading into 2019 and you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="847.24" dur="6.48">to see Trump out there continually</text>
  <text start="851.44" dur="3.45">blaming the Fed for what is about to</text>
  <text start="853.72" dur="3.42">happen well the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="854.89" dur="3.3">fantastic right now the Fed just raised</text>
  <text start="857.14" dur="3.42">the rates again and look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.19" dur="4.35">happening it&amp;#39;s their fault they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="4.62">ones who are doing it and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="5.61">see this happen time and time again</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="5.52">until eventually Trump comes out and</text>
  <text start="868.15" dur="4.56">says it&amp;#39;s the feds fault everything was</text>
  <text start="870.7" dur="4.68">going perfectly until they started</text>
  <text start="872.71" dur="4.38">pushing their policy against my policy</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="4.04">where the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="877.09" dur="3.57">fantastically and the Fed made it</text>
  <text start="879.42" dur="4.84">implode</text>
  <text start="880.66" dur="5.13">so who&amp;#39;s responsible here the Fed let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.26" dur="5.58">take a look at what the Fed has been</text>
