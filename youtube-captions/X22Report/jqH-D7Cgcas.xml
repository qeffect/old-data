  <text start="149.08" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery things are going</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="3.66">well especially here in the United</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="5.43">States are telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="155.02" dur="4.92">just fine retails looking fantastic real</text>
  <text start="158.02" dur="3.63">estate it looks like a dream and we know</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s declining right now but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="6.02">crossing their fingers hoping that that</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="5.85">new law that goes into effect in 2015</text>

  <text start="178.57" dur="4.77">for a little bit longer but we know for</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="3.33">a fact that this is not going to help</text>
  <text start="183.34" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s going to be temporary and</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="3.03">eventually everything is going to start</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="3.45">to collapse and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="3.42">convince us that manufacturing and the</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="3.41">production here in the United States is</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="4.89">doing well in Europe it&amp;#39;s doing well and</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="5.47">this kind it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.49">the Baltic Dry Index has fallen once</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="6.509">again as of December 23rd it has fallen</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="5.37">to 788 points we are getting very close</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="4.051">to that critical level of six hundred</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="4.74">and forty seven points and this is what</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="5.52">it reached after the great recession of</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="5.07">2008 moving into 2012 and then they</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="3.929">pumped it all back up with free money</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="3.93">make them seem like everything is fine</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="4.051">but it looks like they can&amp;#39;t hold on to</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="3.66">this and we&amp;#39;re seeing that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="4.05">is declining things are falling apart</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="4.949">and every week we see the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="5.16">Index continually falling and again this</text>
  <text start="229.329" dur="4.771">is raw material that factories use for</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.65">manufacturing it is very hard to</text>
  <text start="234.1" dur="4.949">manipulate and we&amp;#39;re following this very</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="5.79">very closely now standing &amp;amp; poor&amp;#39;s was</text>

  <text start="272.919" dur="2.731">difficult for them</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="3.66">and they&amp;#39;re hoping to provoke them into</text>
  <text start="275.65" dur="6.15">war and we can see and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="6.27">have to watch exactly how Russia reacts</text>
  <text start="281.8" dur="4.11">to this situation do I think Putin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.32">going to do something crazy absolutely</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="4.979">not it&amp;#39;s not in his character we watched</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="5.13">him in Syria we watched him in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="4.831">and everything that he tries to do is to</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="4.59">promote peace he tries to de-escalate</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="4.77">the problem in both of these areas and</text>

  <text start="302.009" dur="6.551">pretty much create some type of instance</text>
  <text start="305.889" dur="6.81">where war can get started and they have</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="6.81">not stopped now as we know the</text>

  <text start="319.15" dur="5.4">the NSA spying actually hit has gotten</text>
  <text start="322.12" dur="4.59">worse and right now government and</text>
  <text start="324.55" dur="5.58">corporate entities have far too much</text>
  <text start="326.71" dur="5.4">leeway to hack into webcams in order to</text>

  <text start="377.919" dur="4.351">up on charges and throw into prison it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.38" dur="4.11">that simple and if you have to do the</text>

  <text start="402.46" dur="5.7">major problem no one is taking action on</text>
  <text start="405.82" dur="3.96">these people and guess what</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="4.23">nobody will because everyone in the</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="5.07">government is all in this they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="412.39" dur="4.62">blackmailed by the NSA and no one has</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="6.75">the courage to stand up and say enough</text>
  <text start="417.01" dur="6.75">is enough now we understand a couple</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="3.72">weeks ago the CIA torture report came</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="3.15">out and of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="3.84">was out there the government was out</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="4.19">there they did their ABC Washington Post</text>

  <text start="435.4" dur="4.41">poll here on the x 22 report com site</text>

  <text start="439.81" dur="4.68">83% no we should not use torture</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="5.91">seventeen percent said yes we should and</text>
  <text start="444.49" dur="5.22">we can see by many military and</text>

  <text start="496.66" dur="5.04">militarization abroad are coming home</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="5.52">and I said this in the other report if</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="4.35">we torture and they use these poles to</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="4.26">show that everyone is an agreement to</text>

  <text start="509.02" dur="5.37">here inside the United States before you</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="4.289">were even convicted of a crime or</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="4.56">anything like that you&amp;#39;re just suspected</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="3.901">they might torture you to get some</text>

  <text start="523.99" dur="4.86">suspects and they are being tortured and</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="4.47">we have to be very careful with this and</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="4.8">we can see where this is headed they</text>
  <text start="531.28" dur="4.52">want to bring this home they want this</text>
  <text start="533.65" dur="4.93">to be a police state and</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="6.659">we can see they are pretty much</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="5.62">nationalizing our police force when we</text>
  <text start="542.459" dur="4.231">look at this and we look at the trend of</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="5.55">how these active shooter drills have</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="6.24">become massively federalized officers</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="6.75">now are receiving militarized style</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="5.52">training funded and supervised by the US</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="5.49">Department of Justice and the government</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="6.09">subcontractors since 2002 active shooter</text>

  <text start="574.5" dur="4.95">instructed by alert trained personnel</text>
  <text start="577.32" dur="5.13">and over the past 12 years the entity</text>

  <text start="609.69" dur="5.07">everything this government is doing they</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="4.83">are nationalizing federalizing the</text>

  <text start="631.29" dur="3.12">government&amp;#39;s trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="5.52">to take the police separate them from</text>

  <text start="642.75" dur="4.589">people to not be intertwined in the</text>
  <text start="644.459" dur="6.481">community and we can see this is growing</text>
  <text start="647.339" dur="5.31">things have changed since nineteen sixty</text>
  <text start="650.94" dur="3.57">two now are reported on this yesterday</text>
  <text start="652.649" dur="5.071">and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="7.47">receiving a lot of money to have this</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="7.979">type of training now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="6.69">understand the MH 17 was shot down and</text>
  <text start="665.699" dur="3.991">we know it was Ukraine in the United</text>

  <text start="669.69" dur="3.72">all their information confidential the</text>
  <text start="672.15" dur="3.21">United States handed over their</text>

  <text start="676.53" dur="3.24">they don&amp;#39;t need anyone to see this stuff</text>
  <text start="678.03" dur="3.45">and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="679.77" dur="3.36">because they have something to hide and</text>
  <text start="681.48" dur="4.02">there was an eyewitness to the events</text>
  <text start="683.13" dur="4.35">surrounding the downing of the mh17 and</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve given testimony to Russian</text>

  <text start="709.47" dur="4.47">shut down by a military plane and of</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="5.31">course as we know they&amp;#39;re not releasing</text>
  <text start="713.94" dur="5.1">the autopsy report on the pilot so we</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know if he was riddled with bullet</text>
  <text start="719.04" dur="4.05">holes and of course they&amp;#39;re keeping this</text>

  <text start="1007.37" dur="4.68">army for the United States there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1009.44" dur="4.95">a revolution going on where the people</text>

  <text start="1040.04" dur="4.049">the Islamic state and we&amp;#39;ve realized</text>
  <text start="1042.02" dur="4.38">this in Syria where they&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>

  <text start="1070.78" dur="6.3">they are used just like soldiers to</text>
  <text start="1073.54" dur="6.96">fight and again the last count we had</text>
  <text start="1077.08" dur="5.97">was about 5,000 ad in the contractors</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re at 6,000 if they&amp;#39;re sending in</text>
  <text start="1083.05" dur="6.63">more contractors maybe 1500 to another</text>

  <text start="1109" dur="4.47">cost other proposed effort so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1111.55" dur="4.14">weighing this and they&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1113.47" dur="5.07">how many they actually need to go into</text>
  <text start="1115.69" dur="5.67">the country now today the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1118.54" dur="6.09">shot down a Jordanian plane and they</text>
  <text start="1121.36" dur="5.82">captured the pilot this is a complete</text>
  <text start="1124.63" dur="5.06">set up why are they doing this they are</text>
  <text start="1127.18" dur="4.89">getting ready to set up a no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="1129.69" dur="4.63">now they&amp;#39;re going to say the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1132.07" dur="4.77">state has the ability to shut to shoot</text>
  <text start="1134.32" dur="4.59">down planes we are going to have to put</text>
  <text start="1136.84" dur="3.84">a buffer zone in this area they tried</text>
  <text start="1138.91" dur="4.74">once before where they were saying the</text>
  <text start="1140.68" dur="6.63">Islamic state was in training to fly</text>
  <text start="1143.65" dur="5.28">planes they&amp;#39;ve captured three fighter</text>
  <text start="1147.31" dur="4.2">jets and then of course the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1148.93" dur="5.52">government came in pretty much destroyed</text>
  <text start="1151.51" dur="4.74">them and knocked that story out now we</text>
  <text start="1154.45" dur="3.93">have the story that they down a plane</text>
  <text start="1156.25" dur="4.44">and this is very dangerous for the</text>
  <text start="1158.38" dur="4.65">United States for the coalition and</text>
  <text start="1160.69" dur="4.92">there will have to be a buffer zone and</text>
  <text start="1163.03" dur="6.78">we will definitely see this come up very</text>
  <text start="1165.61" dur="6.03">shortly now I mentioned the false flag</text>
  <text start="1169.81" dur="5.88">event where the FBI gave a warning about</text>
  <text start="1171.64" dur="6.63">an I 55 bridge in Memphis Tennessee that</text>
  <text start="1175.69" dur="5.25">they might blow this up now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1178.27" dur="6.96">this before with the world trade centers</text>
  <text start="1180.94" dur="5.94">where the towers were filled with</text>
  <text start="1185.23" dur="4.38">asbestos and it was going to cause</text>
  <text start="1186.88" dur="4.74">billions of dollars to remove all the</text>
  <text start="1189.61" dur="4.62">asbestos from these buildings and this</text>
  <text start="1191.62" dur="4.08">most likely is another reason why the</text>
  <text start="1194.23" dur="3.69">towers were brought down there are many</text>
  <text start="1195.7" dur="4.35">reasons why they were brought down and</text>
  <text start="1197.92" dur="4.63">we know it was an inside job we know</text>
  <text start="1200.05" dur="4.36">there were Mossad agents dancing around</text>
  <text start="1202.55" dur="3.96">they had explosives but they were set</text>
  <text start="1204.41" dur="3.96">free we understand there was a lot going</text>
  <text start="1206.51" dur="4.11">on also there were other buildings that</text>
  <text start="1208.37" dur="4.26">just fell by themselves and we know that</text>
  <text start="1210.62" dur="4.38">they were brought down through</text>
  <text start="1212.63" dur="5.42">demolition and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1215" dur="5.55">the i-55 bridge is going through</text>
  <text start="1218.05" dur="5.23">construction they&amp;#39;re repairing the</text>
  <text start="1220.55" dur="5.04">bridge and this might be an opportunity</text>
  <text start="1223.28" dur="4.56">to bring the bridge down because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1225.59" dur="3.84">costing a lot of money to repair it</text>
  <text start="1227.84" dur="3.81">looks like the bridge is going to be</text>
  <text start="1229.43" dur="4.95">shut down and traffic will be detoured</text>
  <text start="1231.65" dur="7.26">off of this bridge so this makes it a</text>
  <text start="1234.38" dur="6.54">prime suspect to bring down this bridge</text>
  <text start="1238.91" dur="4.11">they get all the traffic off of it they</text>
  <text start="1240.92" dur="4.02">just need to accept some explosives and</text>
  <text start="1243.02" dur="2.93">they can blame it on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1244.94" dur="4.17">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="1245.95" dur="5.62">very very carefully in the next couple</text>
  <text start="1249.11" dur="4.59">of weeks listen everyone thanks a lot</text>
