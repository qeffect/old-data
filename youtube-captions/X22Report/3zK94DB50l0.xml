  <text start="108.22" dur="4.89">news now we have been in this economic</text>
  <text start="110.68" dur="4.65">illusion for quite a while since 2008</text>
  <text start="113.11" dur="6.21">actually before that but it really</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="7.649">started to show its ugly head in 2008</text>
  <text start="119.32" dur="7.079">and this is because we&amp;#39;re at the n cycle</text>
  <text start="122.979" dur="5.821">of a Fayette system which usually lasts</text>
  <text start="126.399" dur="4.651">between 40 and 45 years and here we are</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="4.05">today and basically what the central</text>
  <text start="131.05" dur="4.83">bankers have been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="132.85" dur="6.03">keeping the system alive long enough to</text>
  <text start="135.88" dur="6.12">move us to their new system and like I</text>
  <text start="138.88" dur="6.12">said in past reports there is a battle</text>
  <text start="142" dur="6">going on between the Patriots Trump and</text>
  <text start="145" dur="5.91">the central bankers on where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148" dur="5.99">going to bring us and what system we are</text>
  <text start="150.91" dur="5.85">going to use and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="153.99" dur="7.27">they don&amp;#39;t have that much time left</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="6.33">because the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="3.72">breaking down and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="5.19">indicator after indicator and we talked</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="5.729">about the subprime crisis we talked</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="5.01">about real estate and let&amp;#39;s go over some</text>
  <text start="170.709" dur="4.651">of these indicators because we can see</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="7.169">they&amp;#39;re getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="7.89">goes on now last week use car prices had</text>
  <text start="180.459" dur="5.821">their biggest drop since 2009 directly</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="3.46">after the financial market meltdown of</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="3.67">two</text>
  <text start="186.71" dur="7.98">and eight right now the auto market is</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="6.3">showing signs of an incredible worry we</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="3.6">already mentioned that delinquent</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="5.04">subprime auto loans are higher than they</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="4.23">were last recession and you can see this</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="4.26">all you need to do is look at the graph</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="6.09">and you can see that yes they are rising</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="5.31">very very fast and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="208.61" dur="4.14">worrisome is that consumers defaulting</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.17">on subprime auto loans when the economy</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="3.84">is doing well and we mentioned that</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="2.85">yesterday where they&amp;#39;re saying hey we</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t understand this unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.88" dur="6.72">very low everyone has a job the economy</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="6.66">strong why are we seeing this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="5.46">because basically we&amp;#39;ve been kept in</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.74">this illusion for a very long time</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;ve been handing out statistical</text>
  <text start="232.49" dur="4.95">numbers making us believe that this is</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="4.11">the real economy but what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="3.87">right now is that the truth myth is</text>
  <text start="239.21" dur="5.31">materializing where we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="4.68">truth come out and these individuals are</text>
  <text start="244.52" dur="3.39">going to start to realize oh wait a</text>
  <text start="245.99" dur="4.01">minute let&amp;#39;s look a little bit deeper</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="4.92">and see what&amp;#39;s really going on here are</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.54">we really in a recovery is the economy</text>
  <text start="252.83" dur="3">really strong and people are gonna find</text>
  <text start="254.54" dur="4.44">out wait a minute I think we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="6.75">lied to so what have the central bankers</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="7.62">been up to how have they kept us in this</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="6.57">illusion well their policies made the</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="5.91">entire system fragile by getting</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="6.96">consumers addicted to cheap debt through</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="6.54">their easy money policies they began</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="5.31">tightening credit which now is crippling</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="4.38">the borrowers think of it this way</text>
  <text start="281.42" dur="4.89">imagine you&amp;#39;re addicted to alcohol and</text>
  <text start="283.43" dur="4.92">your bartender keeps giving you cheap</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="4.65">drinks each night for months eventually</text>
  <text start="288.35" dur="5.58">from drinking way more than you should</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="5.73">have been and you know more than you can</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="6.09">afford you now have a very high</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="4.71">tolerance but suddenly the bartender</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="4.23">becomes strict and starts giving you</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="4.56">less booze he tells you sorry but no</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="5.13">more free alcohol for you</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="6.56">problem is you wouldn&amp;#39;t have drank so</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="6.75">much if you had to pay full price for it</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="6.64">now you&amp;#39;re left with awful withdrawals</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="4.56">and now you&amp;#39;re scrounging around trying</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="4.11">to find extra money because</text>
  <text start="320.69" dur="4.26">the alcohol is a lot more money and</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out how you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.95" dur="5.67">gonna pay full price and basically</text>
  <text start="327.53" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re running into a problem and the</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="4.08">only way you can really afford to feel</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="7.02">better is if he starts giving out free</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="5.64">drinks again or your detoxified and we</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="4.47">know what that means</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="6.54">that means the bartender has to cut you</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="5.55">off and you know what happens when</text>
  <text start="346.88" dur="6.66">you&amp;#39;re cut off you go through a period</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="7.11">where you&amp;#39;re detoxifying and you go with</text>
  <text start="353.54" dur="5.88">through withdrawals the same things</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="4.44">going to happen with the economy I mean</text>
  <text start="359.42" dur="3.87">just look at the collapse an auto loan</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="5.73">growth since 2015 when the Fed began</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="6.11">tightening with their end of QE and talk</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="5.55">of rate hikes guess what happened</text>
  <text start="369.4" dur="6.52">everything started to decline the auto</text>
  <text start="372.23" dur="8.01">loan debt declining why because people</text>
  <text start="375.92" dur="7.35">just couldn&amp;#39;t afford it as interest</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="7.43">rates rise it gets harder to borrow</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="8.07">they&amp;#39;re tightening and affordability</text>
  <text start="387.67" dur="5.95">becomes a huge problem history shows us</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="5.16">that when things start their descent</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="5.25">into a collapse the subprime market is</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="4.68">the first to get hit and what are we</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.52">seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="5.73">subprime market get hit and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="404.39" dur="5.22">hit pretty darn hard if we look at</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="5.19">housing right now we know that housing</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="5.34">had a small bounce but we can see in</text>
  <text start="412.1" dur="5.39">April it is tumbled down negative three</text>
  <text start="414.95" dur="6.42">point seven percent month on month and</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="6.07">starts have dropped and it&amp;#39;s worse than</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="4.98">they expected now this is kind of odd</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="5.76">because this is the springtime spring</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="5.34">summer usually a very very strong period</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="4.14">of time for housing people start to look</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="3.87">flowers are blooming the weather is</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="4.38">getting warmer people want to get into</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="5.79">their houses before school and this is</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="5.94">when people start to look once again we</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="4.77">are seeing the same exact problems that</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past now to put all</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="8.34">this into context starts and permanence</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="10.35">remain over 40% below their 2005 2000</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="8.76">six Peaks were not even halfway to where</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="5.93">we were back in 2005-2006 we never</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="7.71">recovered</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="8.709">so the driver of the tumbling housing</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="4.47">starts is multi-family homes which</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="5.221">plunged around eleven point three</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="6.359">percent three of four regions posted</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="4.589">declines and starts led by a sixteen</text>
  <text start="481.759" dur="4.44">point three percent decrease in the</text>
  <text start="483.949" dur="4.581">Midwest and twelve percent drop in the</text>
  <text start="486.199" dur="4.681">West now when we look at mortgage</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="5.199">applications and reef eyes what do we</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="6.27">see well we see the 30-year mortgage</text>
  <text start="493.729" dur="6.72">rate guess what we&amp;#39;re back to the 2011</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="8.07">levels and pretty soon we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="6.331">hitting the 2008-2009 levels and this is</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="2.1">not going to be good because what does</text>
  <text start="506.78" dur="3.75">this do</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="6.269">it pushes many individuals out of the</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="4.559">housing market and we can see already</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="3.721">it&amp;#39;s starting to take an effect on</text>
  <text start="515.089" dur="3.661">mortgage applications refinance</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="4.8">applications all of it</text>
  <text start="518.75" dur="8.01">because the demand is now falling we are</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="8.43">now back to the 2008 levels for mortgage</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="7.19">refinance applications that&amp;#39;s how far we</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="6.69">have dropped I mean it&amp;#39;s amazing and</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="5.77">it&amp;#39;s just getting worse as the rates</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="5.609">continually increase it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="6.119">worse and worse now we&amp;#39;re back to where</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="6.24">we started here back to 2008 levels</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="5.401">almost the rate for mortgages is almost</text>
  <text start="549.079" dur="4.411">back to 2008 levels getting very very</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="5.82">close now there&amp;#39;s a huge difference this</text>
  <text start="553.49" dur="8.13">time the 20 cities that Case Shiller</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="8.1">looks at those housing prices are above</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="6.959">where they were in 2005-2006 we were at</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="6.27">the peak which means the fall is going</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="5.07">to be very hard in these cities and once</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="5.099">the corporate media starts reporting how</text>
  <text start="573.649" dur="4.611">bad this is the rest of the country is</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="5.131">going to get hit very very hard now</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="5.319">places outside of these cities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="3.96">not seeing housing prices continually</text>
  <text start="583.579" dur="3.961">move up a lot of them have leveled off</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="2.46">and some of them that I&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="2.49">at</text>
  <text start="588.08" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve been dropping in price traffic</text>
  <text start="590.03" dur="7.29">is really not there it&amp;#39;s kind of drying</text>
  <text start="592.46" dur="6.45">up and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this continue on</text>
  <text start="597.32" dur="3.15">as we move throughout this summer</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="3.24">because as rates continually move up</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="5.1">there are more and more people being</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="7.29">pushed out of this market so we have</text>
  <text start="605.57" dur="6.39">fast rising mortgage rates and soaring</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="6.65">home prices what do you think happens</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="7.05">next well we saw it back in 2008 again</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="6.07">we&amp;#39;re living in an illusionary world</text>
  <text start="619.01" dur="5.18">it&amp;#39;s coming to an end the truth is going</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="7.29">to come out just like it did in</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="9.16">2008-2009 and we can see right now both</text>
  <text start="629.45" dur="6.24">sides are scrambling because yes they</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="5.04">would like to have a controlled economic</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="5.58">collapse but you always have that black</text>
  <text start="638.39" dur="5.7">swan or that outlier which is the</text>
  <text start="641.27" dur="5.37">economy which is the people which is</text>
  <text start="644.09" dur="5.34">what is really going on in the true</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="6.27">economy well when that starts to break</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="5.01">down just like it did in 2007-2008 the</text>
  <text start="652.91" dur="5.76">real economy there were companies laying</text>
  <text start="654.44" dur="6.75">off people were finding it hard to live</text>
  <text start="658.67" dur="4.47">on what they were earning people were</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="3.78">losing their jobs they couldn&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="4.74">their homes the adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="5.54">mortgages were increasing and basically</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="5.28">in certain different areas like in the</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="5.44">eastern part of the United States that</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="5.07">got hit California got hit then a</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="4.5">trickle down to the South in Florida and</text>
  <text start="678.23" dur="4.5">pretty before you knew it the whole</text>
  <text start="680.45" dur="4.53">entire country Arizona all of it started</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="4.17">to fall apart very very quickly we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.98" dur="4.74">going to see the same exact thing once</text>
  <text start="686.9" dur="5.55">again this time it&amp;#39;s a lot worse because</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="6.63">we&amp;#39;ve never recovered we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="692.45" dur="5.67">illusion home prices in the 26:20 cities</text>

  <text start="698.12" dur="4.71">bubble mortgage rates are rising it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="700.49" dur="5.85">kicking a lot of people out on to this</text>
