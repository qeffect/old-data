  <text start="212.989" dur="3.931">let me just take a part-time job right</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="4.17">now until something comes up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="3.3">hoping and they believe that the economy</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="2.73">is going to get better because the</text>
  <text start="220.22" dur="3.57">government is telling them the Fed is</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="4.17">telling them that yes we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="3.72">recovery so they have this dream that</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="3.84">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="4.59">that this high-paying fantastic job is</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="7.139">going to come along but guess what it</text>
  <text start="232.1" dur="6.81">never does okay as we know the Chinese</text>
  <text start="236.989" dur="4.741">are continually making deals all around</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="4.77">the world they&amp;#39;re pretty much getting</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="5.34">ourselves into many different areas</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="5.25">setting up bilateral trades creating</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="4.169">clearing houses for the you wanna rim be</text>
  <text start="248.93" dur="6.33">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.239" dur="6.271">making a deal with Nicaragua&amp;#39;s grand</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="5.49">canal project that looks like a Chinese</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="5.82">billionaire signed a deal for a 100-year</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="4.14">take over to build this canal and a lot</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="3.63">of the local residents are kind of</text>
  <text start="264.89" dur="3.63">against it because they&amp;#39;re afraid that</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="4.769">the Chinese are going to come in and</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="5.99">take over the entire area and it seems</text>
  <text start="271.729" dur="4.851">like this is going to rival the Panama</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="5.64">now and it looks like they&amp;#39;re going full</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="6.6">force in this direction the president of</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.89">Nicaragua president Ortega handed a</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="4.44">100-year concession to Chinese</text>
  <text start="285.04" dur="4.65">telecommunications magnet Wang Jing and</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="5.73">it seems like they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="6.33">building this and this is going to</text>
  <text start="293.35" dur="4.92">basically become a new offshore banking</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.37">center once free trade areas are</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.47">established within the Canal Zone and</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="4.42">this is going to continually build up</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="7.17">and we&amp;#39;re going to have the Chinese</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="6.72">right down there in Central America now</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.02">it looks like there&amp;#39;s a new poll out</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="5.67">there and it seems that the majority of</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="5.37">Scots back a second referendum and as we</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="4.08">know that first one that was held was</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="4.65">completely fixed it was phony fake and</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.32">false and we we saw many different</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="3.27">videos showing that there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="3.3">ballots that were put in there there was</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="4.59">no way to track these balance they were</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="4.62">just like printed paper with no numbers</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="3.6">or anything on him so they could have</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="3.63">just dumped a whole bunch of them in</text>
  <text start="335.41" dur="4.59">there to make it look good and it looks</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="4.92">like you gov poll has revealed that</text>
  <text start="340" dur="4.41">Scotland would vote yes to independence</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="4.86">if another referendum were held today</text>
  <text start="344.41" dur="4.29">the poll which was carried four times</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="3.69">suggested that the Scottish independence</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="3.6">now enjoys the support of fifty-two</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="3.9">percent of people compared with</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="4.8">forty-eight percent who backed the No</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="4.26">campaign and it seems like if they had</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="3.57">something today they would definitely</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="4.38">vote and they would be completely</text>
  <text start="360.67" dur="5.52">independent and of course we understood</text>
  <text start="363.16" dur="4.89">you England did not want this to happen</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="6.87">and this is why they completely fixed</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="8.7">the elections when this happened now as</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="6.48">we know Obamacare totally not for the</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="4.56">people and we know right now before the</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="3.87">elections when people are signing up on</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.35">health gov com they didn&amp;#39;t want to show</text>
  <text start="383.41" dur="3.96">any of the prices and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="4.56">saying it&amp;#39;s a glitch and we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="387.37" dur="4.89">to show it but let me just reveal some</text>
  <text start="390.22" dur="5.12">of the prices that people are going to</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="5.31">be shocked by once they get the bill and</text>
  <text start="395.34" dur="4.93">we can see you know this is I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="5.4">compare them from 2013 to 2014 at</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.94">different ages of men and women women</text>

  <text start="424.48" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s going to be two hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="5.16">eight dollars all these figures are</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="5.79">coming from health pocket dot-com and</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="4.77">they compared the 2013 prices to the</text>

  <text start="475.78" dur="4.98">can look at your age you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="6.78">between 30 and 60 you can pretty much</text>
  <text start="480.76" dur="4.29">get a rough idea of what your payment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484" dur="4.68">going to be and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="7.68">these are much much higher than before</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="5.52">and of course Obama does not want to</text>
  <text start="492.73" dur="3.15">show this before the elections they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="3.09">rather have a come out afterwards</text>
  <text start="495.88" dur="4.05">because again the election to be over</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="4.62">and this goes back to what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="3.36">saying is that the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="501.91" dur="3.42">got together when they were creating</text>
  <text start="503.29" dur="4.26">Obamacare and said listen to give</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="5.04">everyone insurance what do we need to do</text>
  <text start="507.55" dur="5.369">well we need to raise the premium on</text>
  <text start="510.37" dur="5.52">everyone which they did we need to put a</text>
  <text start="512.919" dur="5.791">penalty on it to force people into the</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="5.43">system which they did and we have to</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="4.139">integrate other taxes into this to make</text>
  <text start="521.32" dur="3.6">sure the government is getting the</text>
  <text start="522.849" dur="5.131">revenue and we need to put clauses in</text>
  <text start="524.92" dur="5.13">there to make sure that if no one takes</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="3.9">the insurance the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="4.02">are bailed out and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="6.72">they did and it is all coming true right</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="6.69">now now we understand that kaci Hickox</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="3.54">the judge ordered that she&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="2.94">to be really quarantined at this time</text>
  <text start="542.14" dur="4.53">she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be quarantined and</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="6.3">of course everyone is nervous if this</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="5.43">Ebola outbreak is actually real I still</text>
  <text start="550" dur="4.77">have questions about this I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.65">the videos and a lot of the people who</text>
  <text start="554.77" dur="4.68">say they have Ebola when they really</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t look like they&amp;#39;re that sick and it</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="3.54">looks like they&amp;#39;re kind of acting I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="5.43">still going on the premise that this</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="6.45">whole thing was created to have the</text>
  <text start="566.53" dur="4.74">military come down into the West African</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="3.81">countries because there&amp;#39;s a lot of oil</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="3.96">and natural resource discovered we have</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="6.9">China and Russia on one side we see the</text>
  <text start="575.23" dur="7.83">Chinese now bringing in 480 so military</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="5.28">medics which they call them but as we</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="3.48">know we have soldiers on one side which</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="3.39">is the United States and we have the</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="5.13">Chinese now on the other side it reminds</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="5.07">me of Sudan where the Chinese have one</text>
  <text start="591.67" dur="4.02">end where they have their military and</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="3.39">the United States has theirs and of</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="3.54">course there&amp;#39;s terrorism going on and</text>
  <text start="597.28" dur="3.18">the two sides are fighting and it seems</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="3.24">like we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing</text>
  <text start="600.46" dur="5.7">occur in this area there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="6.81">question about how this really started</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.97">that the United States kind of gave</text>
  <text start="609.28" dur="4.38">people this type of sickness and they</text>
  <text start="612.13" dur="3.24">didn&amp;#39;t have it there before until they</text>
  <text start="613.66" dur="3.39">went in and got some type of treatment</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="3.66">and they came out there&amp;#39;s a doctor in</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="4.02">Liberia who wrote up a whole entire</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="7.62">thing about this but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="7.68">now is kaci Hickox roommate is diagnosed</text>
  <text start="626.65" dur="4.92">with Ebola right now and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="5.25">understand how she got it when she got</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="5.31">it but they&amp;#39;re saying that she has</text>
  <text start="634" dur="5.46">become infected with Ebola now should</text>
  <text start="636.88" dur="5.28">kaci Hickox be roaming around the town</text>

  <text start="868.61" dur="5.46">have to go back in time a little bit and</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="5.13">understand what is going on here in 2009</text>
  <text start="874.07" dur="4.32">Assad refused to sign a proposed</text>
  <text start="876.05" dur="5.28">agreement with guitar that would run a</text>

  <text start="899.45" dur="4.02">Russia and they decided to say no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.06" dur="4.23">not going to go along with this and we</text>
  <text start="903.47" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t want to sign this deal instead the</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.23">following year Assad pursued</text>
  <text start="908" dur="6.15">negotiations for an alternative 10</text>
  <text start="910.52" dur="6.21">billion pipeline plan which I ran across</text>
  <text start="914.15" dur="5.16">iraq to syria that would also</text>
  <text start="916.73" dur="5.46">potentially allow Iran to supply gas to</text>
  <text start="919.31" dur="4.92">Europe from its South Pars field shared</text>
  <text start="922.19" dur="4.17">with guitar the memorandum of</text>

  <text start="934.49" dur="3.29">to the Syrian people and you can see</text>
  <text start="936.35" dur="4.17">what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point in time</text>
  <text start="937.78" dur="4.21">they are destroying their info</text>
  <text start="940.52" dur="3.9">structure because they want to come in</text>
  <text start="941.99" dur="4.95">put their natural resources on the US</text>
  <text start="944.42" dur="5.01">dollar build these pipelines that they</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="5.04">wanted to build before and then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="949.43" dur="4.26">eventually get into Iran which then they</text>
  <text start="951.98" dur="4.68">will do the same exact thing and we can</text>
  <text start="953.69" dur="5.88">see this is really starting to show</text>
  <text start="956.66" dur="5.78">itself out in the open here and we can</text>
  <text start="959.57" dur="6.48">see what is really going on and again</text>
  <text start="962.44" dur="6.97">the White House right now is downplaying</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="6.21">Hagel&amp;#39;s warning on policy towards Assad</text>
  <text start="969.41" dur="5.37">the policy that we have for Assad is</text>
  <text start="972.26" dur="5.76">really clear we believe that he&amp;#39;s lost</text>
  <text start="974.78" dur="5.07">legitimacy to lead well I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="978.02" dur="4.77">he lost that he had all the people in</text>
  <text start="979.85" dur="5.07">his country vote and they voted him into</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="4.92">power it&amp;#39;s almost like Syria coming out</text>
  <text start="984.92" dur="4.95">saying President Obama lost his</text>
  <text start="987.71" dur="4.44">legitimacy to lead the country of the</text>
  <text start="989.87" dur="4.26">United States would anyone look at this</text>
  <text start="992.15" dur="3.93">and say okay that makes sense let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="994.13" dur="3.81">and invade United States now so this</text>
  <text start="996.08" dur="3.93">whole thing makes no sense but this is</text>
  <text start="997.94" dur="5.88">coming from the White House a two-page</text>

  <text start="1013.33" dur="4.29">the Obama administration&amp;#39;s goal of</text>

  <text start="1019.6" dur="4.859">Islamic state terrorist group in Iraq</text>

  <text start="1024.459" dur="4.591">House had no clear end game for the</text>
  <text start="1026.62" dur="5.58">conflict well you have to remember this</text>
  <text start="1029.05" dur="6.45">whole thing is being created and done to</text>
  <text start="1032.2" dur="6.45">remove Assad the Islamic state is a</text>
