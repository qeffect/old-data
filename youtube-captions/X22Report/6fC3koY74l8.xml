  <text start="85.49" dur="4.53">remember something very important about</text>
  <text start="87.229" dur="4.711">the plan the plan has many moving parts</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s a lot of pieces to it just not</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="4.02">one piece it&amp;#39;s not just well let&amp;#39;s go</text>

  <text start="95.96" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s that we&amp;#39;ve drained the swamp no</text>
  <text start="98.03" dur="8.82">the swamp makes up everything it&amp;#39;s deep</text>
  <text start="102.65" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s wide and it&amp;#39;s infected almost</text>
  <text start="106.85" dur="6.449">everything and this goes all the way</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="7.71">from the FBI to the Central Intelligence</text>
  <text start="113.299" dur="6.801">Agency to the Department of Justice to</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="7.11">the central bank to the bankers and</text>
  <text start="120.1" dur="7.3">outside of the US that&amp;#39;s how deep it is</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="6.389">and we need to remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="4.98">knew once Trump got into office he&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="130.459" dur="4.411">going after all of this they set up a</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="4.889">firewall which is Mueller and certain</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="5.16">things he cannot do right now but there</text>
  <text start="137.269" dur="5.401">is other things the Patriots can do and</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="4.44">they can prepare and this is what we see</text>
  <text start="142.67" dur="5.18">happening right now now very</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="6.45">interestingly Fed Chairman Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="147.85" dur="5.59">had an informal dinner at the White</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="4.53">House and the feds said in a statement</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="5.58">that the two had an informal dinner and</text>
  <text start="155.45" dur="5.64">they discussed the economy during the</text>
  <text start="159.02" dur="4.469">meal according to the Fed Powell</text>
  <text start="161.09" dur="3.68">reaffirmed that he will not take Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.489" dur="2.841">criticism in</text>
  <text start="164.77" dur="3.96">to consideration when conducting</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="4.86">monetary policy and instead will make</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="6.24">those decisions based solely on careful</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="7.91">objective and non-political analysis now</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="7.59">this had to be done because why the</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="7.18">mainstream media the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="182.56" dur="8.28">pushing it out there that Powell folded</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="6.66">under Trump&amp;#39;s Direction trump by having</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="5.01">this dinner and having powell say listen</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.54">I know you&amp;#39;re criticizing me I know what</text>
  <text start="195.85" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="6.6">but I will make my own decisions for the</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="6.51">good of I guess the country but really</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="5.1">the good of the central bankers now of</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="4.23">course he&amp;#39;s not really making these</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="5.22">decisions for the central bankers he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="5.25">in coordination with Trump but they</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="5.1">needed to do this to throw the deep</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="5.37">state and the rest off the scent because</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="5.19">we need to remember what did the deep</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="5.4">state what did the bad guys in the</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="5.28">central bank&amp;#39;s have planned they wanted</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="4.92">they were trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.23">economy in 2020 this is why we had a</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="4.02">coordinated effort between all the</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="5.85">mainstream media outlets financial</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="6.69">pundits to say 2020 was the date of the</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="5.49">recession slash depression cue has told</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.5">us we have countermeasures for this and</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="4.5">we can see already they&amp;#39;re putting these</text>
  <text start="246.7" dur="3.66">into place now does this mean we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="249.04" dur="3.72">going to have a recession does this mean</text>
  <text start="250.36" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s all over no what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="252.76" dur="4.949">what they call kicking it down the road</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="5.94">a little bit longer they need to do this</text>
  <text start="257.709" dur="5.971">because if the system comes down during</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="4.71">the 2020 elections well everything that</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="4.08">was planned and remember this plan has</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.39">been planned for for a very long time</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s not something they came up with</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="4.38">when Trump came into office and said hey</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="4.56">let&amp;#39;s start this plan they plan to get</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="4.77">him into office and then they planned</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="5.28">for after when he was in office and they</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="4.079">have contingency plans to deal with</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="3.78">things like Mueller and other things</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="6">that the deep state continually throws</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="7.81">at them so we are now headed towards a</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="6.101">period where Trump</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="7.56">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="8.46">draining other areas and they they have</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="7.29">been draining the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="5.64">the FBI government offices because the</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="4.02">deep state was all over the place</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="5.33">now they&amp;#39;re gonna be going after the</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="7.32">World Trade Organization the World Bank</text>
  <text start="314.2" dur="6.76">IMF and any other organization the</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="5.73">central bank set up with the help of the</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.97">deep state now we can do something on</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="4.83">our own we can beat the bankers at their</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="3.93">own game we can beat the elite at their</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="3.6">own game and my good friend Greg</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="4.35">Mannarino he has always said listen</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="5.36">become your own central bank which means</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="6.93">have gold and silver crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="8.32">don&amp;#39;t depend on the banking system</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="6.57">actually if you can feed yourself if you</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="4.71">can produce your own energy if you can</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.16">do all these things you wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="351.23" dur="4.17">dependent on the elite now I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="3.12">very difficult for many to do this</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="4.32">because many people are living in the</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="4.2">inner city many people don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="2.82">do this or don&amp;#39;t have the funds to do</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="5.88">this but if you just do one or two</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="8.31">little things to be independent it goes</text>
  <text start="367.07" dur="5.91">a long way and as time goes on you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="370.85" dur="3.48">able to do more and more it&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="372.98" dur="3.33">little bit at a time everyone tries to</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="6.03">do everything at once and you need to</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="9.35">take it one step at a time now Trump is</text>
  <text start="380.36" dur="8.78">getting ready to appoint the next</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="7.83">president of the World Bank now remember</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="8.86">Jim Yong Kim who was appointed by Obama</text>
  <text start="393.49" dur="8.02">all of a sudden decided to resign now he</text>
  <text start="398" dur="7.56">had his post until 2022 but he decided</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="7.62">to exit early that allowed Trump to go</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="7.88">ahead and find someone else now it looks</text>
  <text start="409.13" dur="7.47">like he&amp;#39;s looking at David Malpass and</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="5.23">Steve Moore a Heritage Foundation</text>
  <text start="416.6" dur="6.42">economist with close ties to the White</text>
  <text start="418.67" dur="6.96">House said that this person would be a</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="6.08">dream come true he added</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="7.2">world bank is the swamp of international</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="6.87">bureaucrats have all the wrong ideas and</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="7.5">it needs to be completely cleaned out</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="4.93">david Malpass would be an ideal guy to</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.98">do it</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="7.08">now remember Trump has the ability to</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="5.82">place someone in there to completely</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="7.1">clean out or what we say is drain the</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="8.55">swamp in this area and then eventually</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="6.91">restructure the system now Q is told us</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="5.34">that fed is going to be restructured I</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="6.66">believe that the World Bank eventually</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="5.43">the IMF the World Trade Organization the</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="3.87">Federal Reserve and central banks with</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="4.56">in many many countries they&amp;#39;re all going</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="4.65">to be restructured or taken over and I</text>
  <text start="475.01" dur="4.38">think this is where the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="4.4">headed as you can see I mean Trump</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="4.56">called out the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="481.57" dur="5.14">Trump got rid of the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="6.93">deals Trump set up bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="6.39">got rid of NAFTA restructured it getting</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="3.54">rid of Obamacare has nothing to do a</text>
  <text start="493.1" dur="4.56">trade deal but it&amp;#39;s another thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.42" dur="5.28">getting rid of decided that you know</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="4.38">something let me point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="499.7" dur="4.41">Fed every time you see the economy move</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="4.71">down or there&amp;#39;s problems with the</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="6.42">economy it&amp;#39;s the feds fault he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="6.12">all of this up on purpose and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="3.569">doing it one step at a time they just</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="3.24">can&amp;#39;t come out of the gate and say hey</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="5.221">you know something let&amp;#39;s take it all</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="6.15">down go back to the beginning of his</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="4.92">presidency when he started to make moves</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="5.1">on the deep state in government</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="8.1">remember the deep state their deep and</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="6.54">wide in every aspect of our lives there</text>
  <text start="532.34" dur="3.27">in the central banking system than in</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="4.29">the world trade organizations they are</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.68">everywhere and you can see the Patriots</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re a little bit more careful right</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="6">now because they take it one step at a</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="5.97">time they don&amp;#39;t try to push too hard but</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="3.99">they push and they see who they can get</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="3.33">to resign they push a little bit more</text>
  <text start="550.28" dur="4.17">they see who they can get to resign and</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="4.17">before you know it you see all these</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="3.889">resignations or you see people getting</text>
  <text start="556.46" dur="4.46">fired</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="5.391">what happens over time is the Patriots</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="5.01">well they control the entire situation</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="5.32">we see that with the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="565.93" dur="6.659">right now they I do believe are in</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="7.259">control they have stopped what was</text>
  <text start="572.589" dur="8.071">supposed to happen in 2020 they need the</text>
  <text start="576.309" dur="7.431">time to allow the elections to happen I</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="6.899">do believe they&amp;#39;re preparing a report</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="7.329">for the elections so they can produce it</text>
  <text start="587.559" dur="6.03">before the 2020 elections everything</text>
  <text start="591.069" dur="4.26">that we&amp;#39;re watching now is being</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="3.81">prepared because I do believe the second</text>
  <text start="595.329" dur="4.771">term of Trump he&amp;#39;s gonna be able to do a</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="4.891">lot of things and no one will be able to</text>
  <text start="600.1" dur="4.109">stop him because he doesn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="602.29" dur="3.719">worry about reelection he knows</text>
  <text start="604.209" dur="6">everything that he&amp;#39;s done in this first</text>
  <text start="606.009" dur="7.5">term he can now take that and then move</text>
  <text start="610.209" dur="4.92">forward with it without fear and I</text>
  <text start="613.509" dur="3.091">believe this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="615.129" dur="3.18">do they&amp;#39;re trying to take the first term</text>
  <text start="616.6" dur="3.929">they&amp;#39;re trying to prepare everything and</text>
  <text start="618.309" dur="3.84">that means they are preparing the</text>
  <text start="620.529" dur="3.841">Federal Reserve to be taken down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.149" dur="4.38">preparing all the trade agreements which</text>
  <text start="624.37" dur="4.86">we see they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring back</text>
  <text start="626.529" dur="4.43">manufacturing they&amp;#39;re preparing to</text>
  <text start="629.23" dur="4.169">restructure the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="630.959" dur="4.721">they are preparing to drain the swamp in</text>
  <text start="633.399" dur="5.641">the World Bank they&amp;#39;re preparing all of</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="5.629">these things before the next elections</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="3.75">because if you have everything prepared</text>
  <text start="641.309" dur="5.46">guess what</text>
  <text start="642.79" dur="8.25">it&amp;#39;s go time and they can do quite a bit</text>
  <text start="646.769" dur="6.701">after the fact and there&amp;#39;ll be nothing</text>
  <text start="651.04" dur="6.419">to stop them they will be completely in</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="6.359">full control and we will see lightning</text>
  <text start="657.459" dur="5.22">speed changes like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="659.829" dur="4.771">before and the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="662.679" dur="4.861">bankers they won&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.6" dur="7.039">hitting them and we can see that may be</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="6.45">part of their plan is to confuse</text>
  <text start="671.639" dur="4.031">everyone out there especially with the</text>

  <text start="675.67" dur="5.43">Reserve step back on their rate hikes</text>
  <text start="677.589" dur="5.79">now we see gold inching up like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="681.1" dur="3.779">really never seen before I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="683.379" dur="4.65">seen it before and then it was</text>
  <text start="684.879" dur="6.481">suppressed but think about it if gold</text>
  <text start="688.029" dur="7.081">continually rises and</text>
  <text start="691.36" dur="7.61">Fed stops manipulating the precious</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="9.27">metals market and that lets gold rise</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="15.58">not too fast but just let it rise 1350</text>
  <text start="704.38" dur="13.62">14 15 15 50 what happens the Fed would</text>
  <text start="714.55" dur="5.75">be panicking the mainstream media would</text>
  <text start="718" dur="4.61">be panicking because that&amp;#39;s an indicator</text>
  <text start="720.3" dur="4.599">that&amp;#39;s an indicator that means</text>
  <text start="722.61" dur="4.69">something&amp;#39;s wrong with the dollar it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.899" dur="5.641">an indicator letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="727.3" dur="4.11">the dollar is worth less and less and</text>
  <text start="730.54" dur="5.88">less</text>
  <text start="731.41" dur="8.94">I remember Q saying that gold will</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="6.95">destroy the Fed maybe Q is not talking</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="7.79">about physical gold that they found</text>
  <text start="743.37" dur="10.86">maybe Q is talking about the gold price</text>
  <text start="748.14" dur="12.34">because once it gets to 1900 2000 2500</text>
  <text start="754.23" dur="10.539">3000 guess what gold starts to destroy</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="8.099">the Fed people wake up what do you think</text>
  <text start="764.769" dur="7.76">happens when the gold prices moves move</text>
  <text start="768.579" dur="7.111">up like this other people join in and</text>
  <text start="772.529" dur="6.42">when more and more people join in what</text>
  <text start="775.69" dur="6.87">happens the price goes up when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.949" dur="6.281">harder to find what happens when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.56" dur="5.67">harder to get what happens the price</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="6.65">goes up if the price continually moves</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="6.15">up what does it say about the dollar</text>
  <text start="791.88" dur="4">what does it say about the Fed now we</text>
  <text start="794.38" dur="4.23">all know because we&amp;#39;ve been doing the</text>
  <text start="795.88" dur="4.35">research we know that the dollar has</text>
  <text start="798.61" dur="5.46">lost its value and that&amp;#39;s what they call</text>
  <text start="800.23" dur="5.789">inflation they pretend that you know the</text>
  <text start="804.07" dur="3.09">physical merchandise is going up in</text>
  <text start="806.019" dur="3.06">price but that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="807.16" dur="4.32">happening what&amp;#39;s really happening the</text>
  <text start="809.079" dur="5.12">physical merchandise is the same as has</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="6.06">always been it&amp;#39;s the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="814.199" dur="6.851">that is decreasing which means it takes</text>
  <text start="817.54" dur="7.55">more of those paper notes to get the</text>
  <text start="821.05" dur="7.17">same exact thing that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s changing</text>
  <text start="825.09" dur="8.41">so if gold continually moves up it shows</text>
  <text start="828.22" dur="9.42">the dollar is devaluing so when Q says</text>
  <text start="833.5" dur="7.55">gold will destroy the Fed maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.64" dur="7.23">letting gold do what it does best on a</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="7.72">free and open market and when you see</text>
  <text start="844.87" dur="7.62">gold moving up it eventually will</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="6.35">destroy the Fed how will the Fed explain</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="6.33">this away when the people of the world</text>
  <text start="855.12" dur="7.24">see this and remember a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="858.82" dur="9.36">have quite a bit of gold Russia China</text>
  <text start="862.36" dur="9.09">India many others their holdings are</text>
  <text start="868.18" dur="8.79">worth more than what they purchased it</text>
  <text start="871.45" dur="9.54">for think about the power of gold think</text>
  <text start="876.97" dur="6.54">about what is being done here so the</text>
  <text start="880.99" dur="6.9">price of gold that we see today 13 in</text>
  <text start="883.51" dur="7.83">change this is the suppressed number the</text>
  <text start="887.89" dur="6.78">Federal Reserve wants us to see if we go</text>
  <text start="891.34" dur="5.43">to US debt clock dot-org and we look at</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="5.7">the bottom right-hand corner they have</text>
  <text start="896.77" dur="7.98">dollar to silver ratio in 1913 terms and</text>

  <text start="939.1" dur="6.18">now it would be five thousand six</text>
