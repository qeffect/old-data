  <text start="102.17" dur="5.489">there has been a lot of terrorist acts</text>
  <text start="105.62" dur="4.65">which we know a lot of them were false</text>
  <text start="107.659" dur="5.611">flags and there were certain agendas</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="4.95">attached to them where the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.27" dur="6.87">were taking the rights away from the</text>
  <text start="115.22" dur="7.8">people creating new laws for security</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="6">purposes and we saw this happening</text>

  <text start="139.099" dur="7.581">receive lessons on how to survive a</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="6.63">terrorist attack on their schools so</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="4.15">what they&amp;#39;re looking to do and this is</text>
  <text start="148.58" dur="5.189">coming from the Francis interior</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="6.989">minister he announced that France would</text>
  <text start="153.769" dur="5.851">deploy about 3,000 reserve troops to</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="4.201">train school authorities and ramp up</text>
  <text start="159.62" dur="4.5">school anti-terror drills in case of</text>
  <text start="162.02" dur="4.889">attacks</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="5.28">saying the threat is high it is real and</text>
  <text start="166.909" dur="8.091">we need to have these individuals</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="8.55">trained in a certain way so around 500</text>
  <text start="175" dur="4.959">school administrators will be trained</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="4.679">every year at the National Training</text>

  <text start="182.629" dur="5.7">as intermediaries with security</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="4.83">officials they&amp;#39;ll have active</text>
  <text start="188.329" dur="4.531">surveillance around schools high schools</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="6.539">and universities and it will be</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="6.659">reinforced by roving patrols it sounds</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="6.651">more like a prison to me than a school</text>
  <text start="199.519" dur="6.991">or a high school or university</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="7.929">children&amp;#39;s age two to six they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="7.67">to be told to hide and stay quiet and we</text>
  <text start="211.129" dur="7.161">can see that all of the countries are</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="10.419">starting to do this they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="9.879">have these lessons on terror drills that</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="6.741">we&amp;#39;re going to need roving patrols we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.169" dur="5.94">going to need surveillance in the area</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.47">Germany right now is deciding whether to</text>
  <text start="234.109" dur="5.85">put troops on the streets to protect the</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="5.64">population from terrorism they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="4.68">telling the people to prepare for a</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="7.159">terrorist attack for some type of</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="7.581">catastrophe so we can see at this moment</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="7.451">there&amp;#39;s a common theme running</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="8.1">throughout Europe right now that they</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="6.32">are preparing for something to happen</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="6.219">they&amp;#39;re taking away the people&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="263.38" dur="7.75">they&amp;#39;re imprisoning them in their own</text>
  <text start="266.539" dur="8.1">country now the question is why do they</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="5.52">have to go to such extremes why can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.639" dur="4.741">the people protect themselves give</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.519">people a weapon because this is not what</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s about this is about controlling the</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="5.991">people when the system goes down this is</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="9.03">about controlling and monitoring</text>
  <text start="288.16" dur="8.92">everyone when the system collapses and a</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="3.99">population that has a weapon well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="3.39">very hard to control the</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="5.82">people but a population who is afraid</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="5.04">and scared we&amp;#39;ll see the roving patrols</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="4.14">will have surveillance cameras on them</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.4">all the time you can control these</text>
  <text start="308.03" dur="5.55">people when things start breaking down</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="9.1">they tell people to hide don&amp;#39;t look stay</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="7.71">at a site and we can see right now this</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="4.5">is what&amp;#39;s happening throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="321.29" dur="4.49">it&amp;#39;s going to happen in Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="5.76">going to happen in the United States</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="6.96">countries have been preparing for this</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="5.55">collapse scenario they know it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="5.92">they know we&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="6.21">through this transition period they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.66" dur="5.64">prepared for it they understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="6.69">going to happen you need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="6.3">for what&amp;#39;s about to happen we see Russia</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="8.1">they are on high alert right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="7.71">having a massive snap exercise and the</text>
  <text start="355.82" dur="4.59">reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this and this</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="5.13">will last until about august 31st is</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="5.72">because they realize NATO and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="5.9">they are at their doorstep Putin</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="5.65">understands that there&amp;#39;s going to be war</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="6.16">sooner or later there&amp;#39;s going to be war</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="5.25">because he can tell that the United</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="5.54">States government central bankers first</text>
  <text start="377.03" dur="6.87">of all whatever they say it&amp;#39;s a lie and</text>
  <text start="381.04" dur="5.8">secondly they&amp;#39;re continually pushing</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="4.8">more they have not stopped now am I</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="5.67">saying that Russia is the better choice</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="5.79">or China is the better choice no but</text>
  <text start="392.51" dur="9.15">from their actions from what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="10.23">been doing they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this</text>
  <text start="401.66" dur="6.75">war march because if they really wanted</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="6.12">war it&amp;#39;d be very easy to do they could</text>
  <text start="408.41" dur="3.87">have done it back in 2013 when the</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="3.66">United States wanted to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="4.62">Russia said come on in we&amp;#39;ll be waiting</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="5.97">for you we&amp;#39;re going to back Assad let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="5.25">start the war in Ukraine when the u.s.</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="5.67">paid billions of dollars for the coup</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="5.46">d&amp;#39;etat Russia could have said you know</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="3.57">something we&amp;#39;re going to get involved</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="3.66">here we&amp;#39;re going to bring our tanks or</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="2.34">planes and we&amp;#39;re just going to go right</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="3.48">through</text>
  <text start="432.05" dur="5.429">Kiev and you know what the United States</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="5.43">try to stop us in the Pacific China</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="6.861">could say you know something you come</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="7.56">any closer we&amp;#39;re gonna hit your ship and</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="6.549">they could have just shot a shot across</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.76">the bow and guess what war would have</text>
  <text start="450.889" dur="5.851">been started North Korea if they really</text>

  <text start="663.56" dur="10.26">war they&amp;#39;re provoking Iran right now the</text>
  <text start="669.23" dur="9.06">US military they&amp;#39;re outraged because for</text>
  <text start="673.82" dur="8.33">Iranian military speedboats decided to</text>
  <text start="678.29" dur="6.93">come close to a guided missile destroyer</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="5.68">that was passing near the Iranian listen</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="6.96">to this passing near the Iranian coast</text>
  <text start="687.83" dur="7.53">at the Strait of Hormuz so we have a</text>
  <text start="692.18" dur="7.02">ship United States ship off the coast of</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="6.199">Iran now when you really look at what</text>
  <text start="699.2" dur="6.809">happened</text>
  <text start="701.559" dur="10.39">basically nothing happened these four</text>
  <text start="706.009" dur="9.62">little speed boats they must remain at</text>
  <text start="711.949" dur="9.151">least 50 meters away from any ship and</text>
  <text start="715.629" dur="9.87">they were 50 or more meters away from</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="8.75">the ship so there was no threat there</text>
  <text start="725.499" dur="8.14">what the United States did though is</text>
  <text start="729.85" dur="8.019">they decided to fire flares up in the</text>
  <text start="733.639" dur="10.14">air and made some unspecific type of</text>
  <text start="737.869" dur="8.97">noises hoping the Iranian boats would</text>
  <text start="743.779" dur="7.23">react in some way but they were so far</text>
  <text start="746.839" dur="6.99">away they did nothing because they</text>
  <text start="751.009" dur="5.25">weren&amp;#39;t interested in the ship the</text>
  <text start="753.829" dur="4.831">United States was trying to do something</text>
  <text start="756.259" dur="4.5">they spotted them and they said okay</text>
  <text start="758.66" dur="4.56">let&amp;#39;s set up a flare let&amp;#39;s make some</text>
  <text start="760.759" dur="5.79">noise here let&amp;#39;s see if they come closer</text>
  <text start="763.22" dur="5.809">and they didn&amp;#39;t so nothing happened this</text>
  <text start="766.549" dur="6.301">is complete propaganda once again</text>
  <text start="769.029" dur="5.441">Germany right now they are thinking</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="5.76">about withdrawing their Jets from the</text>
  <text start="774.47" dur="6.119">interlock base since turkey is denying</text>

  <text start="780.589" dur="6.09">are deployed there and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="783.199" dur="5.82">follow that and see how that goes the</text>
  <text start="786.679" dur="6.96">u.s. right now is admitting okay we</text>
  <text start="789.019" dur="8.22">might have killed some civilians in many</text>
  <text start="793.639" dur="7.44">of the different regions in Syria when</text>
  <text start="797.239" dur="6.241">we were targeting the Islamic state well</text>
  <text start="801.079" dur="5.76">what do you mean by some and of course</text>
  <text start="803.48" dur="5.88">they said you know we possibly could</text>
  <text start="806.839" dur="4.86">have killed many civilians we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="809.36" dur="4.169">know how many so what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="811.699" dur="3.72">about all of this is that the United</text>
  <text start="813.529" dur="4.35">States just admitted that they killed</text>
  <text start="815.419" dur="6.84">civilians which are probably women</text>
  <text start="817.879" dur="6.15">children they don&amp;#39;t care about that but</text>
  <text start="822.259" dur="4.35">when they have a chance to use</text>
  <text start="824.029" dur="5.131">propaganda and to show a little boy</text>
  <text start="826.609" dur="4.65">who&amp;#39;s still living and say look what</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="4.11">Assad has done it&amp;#39;s amazing the</text>
  <text start="831.259" dur="3.991">propaganda that they&amp;#39;ll push</text>
  <text start="833.27" dur="5.19">but when the question is asked have you</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="5.19">killed civilians in Syria while by among</text>
  <text start="838.46" dur="4.92">the Islamic state which that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="840.44" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re bombing they have to say yes</text>
  <text start="843.38" dur="6">because there is no way in the world</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="7.11">they didn&amp;#39;t because proof is coming out</text>
  <text start="849.38" dur="4.47">of that area that after the bombing here</text>
  <text start="852.5" dur="5.67">all the people that died now we</text>
  <text start="853.85" dur="7.56">understand turkey invaded Syria the US</text>
  <text start="858.17" dur="5.72">assisted in this and Russia&amp;#39;s response</text>
  <text start="861.41" dur="6.78">right now to earlier ones aggression is</text>
  <text start="863.89" dur="7.24">muted they really haven&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="868.19" dur="5.1">said anything they haven&amp;#39;t said that</text>
  <text start="871.13" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re worried about what is going on</text>
  <text start="873.29" dur="9.09">and they&amp;#39;re just staying quiet at this</text>
  <text start="876.71" dur="9.87">point now we know that turkey is using</text>
  <text start="882.38" dur="7.82">the excuse they&amp;#39;re in there because the</text>
  <text start="886.58" dur="7.23">Islamic state fired rockets at them and</text>
  <text start="890.2" dur="7.39">they attack them and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="893.81" dur="6">gone into Syria now we know from the</text>
  <text start="897.59" dur="6.18">past IRDA one has used this many many</text>
  <text start="899.81" dur="5.85">times before so we see the Turks they</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="6.39">are sending more and more tanks into</text>
  <text start="905.66" dur="6.42">this region and one of their missions as</text>
  <text start="910.16" dur="4.11">we know is to set up this exclusion</text>
  <text start="912.08" dur="3.57">buffer zone safe zone no bombs own</text>
  <text start="914.27" dur="4.47">whatever they like to call it because</text>
  <text start="915.65" dur="6.78">they keep changing the names they want</text>
  <text start="918.74" dur="7.08">to set up this exclusion zone and the</text>
  <text start="922.43" dur="6.69">other goal that they have is to control</text>
  <text start="925.82" dur="6.26">a 100 kilometer long corridor that will</text>
  <text start="929.12" dur="8.22">help Turkey to assist radical groups</text>
  <text start="932.08" dur="9.64">move in and out of Turkey now they</text>
  <text start="937.34" dur="6.09">should just close the border if they</text>
  <text start="941.72" dur="4.26">really wanted to stop all of this but</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="6.84">they don&amp;#39;t want to stop all of this they</text>
  <text start="945.98" dur="7.02">want to control this area they want to</text>
  <text start="950.27" dur="6.21">control the stretch of this border to</text>
  <text start="953" dur="8.49">allow individuals in and out and these</text>
  <text start="956.48" dur="7.8">are the terrorists so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="961.49" dur="5.16">right now is turkey cannot allow this</text>
  <text start="964.28" dur="2.73">stretch of border to be sealed because</text>
  <text start="966.65" dur="2.94">if they</text>
  <text start="967.01" dur="7.29">happens the balance of power in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="969.59" dur="9.15">will shift to Syria and this is why</text>
  <text start="974.3" dur="7.62">they&amp;#39;re there so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="978.74" dur="6.36">that turkey has solidified its</text>
  <text start="981.92" dur="8.34">willingness to risk our right war with</text>
  <text start="985.1" dur="10.53">Syria and even Russia to fulfill the</text>
  <text start="990.26" dur="7.74">goals of NATO and the u.s. so right now</text>
  <text start="995.63" dur="5.07">the Turkish agenda it&amp;#39;s not focused on</text>
  <text start="998" dur="4.44">the Islamic state because if it really</text>
  <text start="1000.7" dur="3.48">was they would have done what Rush is</text>
  <text start="1002.44" dur="3.39">said to do close the borders have</text>
  <text start="1004.18" dur="4.62">international monitors but they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1005.83" dur="5.97">do it the Turks do not need a buffer</text>
  <text start="1008.8" dur="4.98">zone to end the terrorism they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="3.03">need any of that stuff so we can see</text>
  <text start="1013.78" dur="4.38">their mission is completely different</text>
  <text start="1014.83" dur="8.73">and we&amp;#39;re getting word that all of this</text>
  <text start="1018.16" dur="8.82">was planned over two years ago with the</text>
  <text start="1023.56" dur="7.74">US and the coalition forces on how to</text>
  <text start="1026.98" dur="6.99">have a ground invasion now the official</text>
  <text start="1031.3" dur="4.289">he didn&amp;#39;t want to be named said the</text>
  <text start="1033.97" dur="4.56">government they&amp;#39;ve been working on this</text>
  <text start="1035.589" dur="4.801">for over two years but they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1038.53" dur="6.929">delayed they&amp;#39;ve tried many times if you</text>
  <text start="1040.39" dur="8.13">remember her one cent individuals into</text>
  <text start="1045.459" dur="5.131">Syria they had rocket launchers they</text>
  <text start="1048.52" dur="3.84">fired rocket launchers into Turkey and</text>
  <text start="1050.59" dur="5.64">earned one went out there and said</text>
  <text start="1052.36" dur="5.82">listen Syria&amp;#39;s attacking us while this</text>
  <text start="1056.23" dur="5.73">was to have the ground invasion started</text>
  <text start="1058.18" dur="6.3">but what happened was someone filmed it</text>
  <text start="1061.96" dur="5.94">put it on YouTube put it on Twitter and</text>
  <text start="1064.48" dur="7.68">her 11 crazy and started to ban Twitter</text>
  <text start="1067.9" dur="5.67">and YouTube and the plan was called off</text>
  <text start="1072.16" dur="4.4">so they tried to do this many many times</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="6.17">before and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1076.56" dur="6.61">they are on the move so we have us</text>
  <text start="1079.74" dur="7.42">trying to create this no-fly zone this</text>
  <text start="1083.17" dur="7.5">buffer zone and now we have Russia most</text>
  <text start="1087.16" dur="8.31">likely will set up their no-fly zone in</text>
  <text start="1090.67" dur="9.89">Syria because Russia they see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1095.47" dur="5.09">happening here and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1100.62" dur="6.36">the agenda of carving up and going all</text>
  <text start="1104.55" dur="6.54">out to get Assad it&amp;#39;s in the works</text>
  <text start="1106.98" dur="8.1">because we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1111.09" dur="5.4">international team at the UN they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1115.08" dur="6.06">come up with this report and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1116.49" dur="7.59">amazing the timing of this report you</text>
  <text start="1121.14" dur="4.53">know because the United States has lost</text>
  <text start="1124.08" dur="5.07">their proxy army which is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1125.67" dur="5.88">state they&amp;#39;re losing their territory in</text>
  <text start="1129.15" dur="4.71">Syria they&amp;#39;re not even supposed to be in</text>
  <text start="1131.55" dur="4.86">Syria because they invaded a sovereign</text>
  <text start="1133.86" dur="5.49">country turkey invaded with a Ground</text>
  <text start="1136.41" dur="6.66">Force and then all of a sudden the UN</text>
  <text start="1139.35" dur="6.6">decided to release this new report about</text>
  <text start="1143.07" dur="6.65">who was responsible for the chemical</text>
  <text start="1145.95" dur="6.81">attacks in 2014 and 2015 they just</text>
  <text start="1149.72" dur="5.08">figured it out and they&amp;#39;re saying it was</text>
  <text start="1152.76" dur="6.6">okay the Islamic state which is almost</text>
  <text start="1154.8" dur="10.47">gone and Syria now do they have the</text>
  <text start="1159.36" dur="9.93">proof no once again they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>

  <text start="1169.29" dur="8.13">is using this they&amp;#39;re urging action over</text>
  <text start="1175.02" dur="4.68">the Syrian chemical attack they are</text>
  <text start="1177.42" dur="7.08">doing the same exact thing that they did</text>
  <text start="1179.7" dur="6.359">back in 2013 which was proven that Syria</text>
  <text start="1184.5" dur="5.58">didn&amp;#39;t do these attacks they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1186.059" dur="6.87">the sarin gas at the time when the tax</text>
  <text start="1190.08" dur="5.37">occurred it was the moderate rebels the</text>
  <text start="1192.929" dur="5.431">chlorine gas the mustard gas that we saw</text>
