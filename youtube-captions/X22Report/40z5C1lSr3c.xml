  <text start="149.37" dur="4.8">using Turkey to get the Turkish stream</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.85">pipeline built because remember this</text>

  <text start="164.19" dur="5.37">pipeline there&amp;#39;s two pipelines here and</text>
  <text start="166.49" dur="6.28">we can see right now that the US wants</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="6.3">their pipeline and russia wants their</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="5.34">pipeline and this is the major battle</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="5.97">because guitar wants to build a pipeline</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="7.56">through Syria up into Europe that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="5.52">battle right now in Syria that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="4.23">started because Assad said you know</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="5.34">something I don&amp;#39;t want this pipeline I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="7.02">not going to go with what you want and</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s how this war started now Lavrov</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="4.83">is out there and he is expressing</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.1">concerns about what turkey is doing in</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="5.31">Syria and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="5.28">taking it a little too far right now and</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;m going again Surya is looking at the</text>
  <text start="210" dur="3.63">situation and saying well they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="5.1">have permission to be in this country</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="5.07">they violated our sovereignty so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="4.14">going to have to watch that situation</text>
  <text start="218.7" dur="6.18">very closely the United States came out</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.94">and they said that they&amp;#39;ve discussed a</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="4.68">ceasefire with Turkey but turkey right</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="4.89">now saying well we don&amp;#39;t really agree</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="7.5">with the ceasefire with the Syrian with</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="8.82">via Kurds in Syria we don&amp;#39;t accept the</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="7.29">u.s. announcement of this loose truce so</text>
  <text start="241.08" dur="6.32">again turkey is in there creating chaos</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="5.76">the United States is using the Kurds</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="4.48">they are clearing the way for a buffer</text>
  <text start="250.11" dur="3.87">zone they&amp;#39;re clearing away for a</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="3.359">corridor and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="5.97">watch this situation very closely</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="7.321">because we understand out in this entire</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.61">area the United States has already put</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="4.32">up a travel alert to Turkey telling</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="3.72">individuals to get out of the country</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.77">once again so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="4.8">about to do something once again in</text>
  <text start="271.65" dur="5.49">Turkey now will this be another attempt</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="6.6">to remove dirt awan will this be another</text>
  <text start="277.14" dur="6.77">attempt for something completely</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="6.35">different we don&amp;#39;t know but we can tell</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="5.92">something is about to happen once again</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="5.98">now the United States government central</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="5.67">bankers they came out with this UN</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="5.399">report which was issued by the UN but</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="5.729">they had their hands and they meddled in</text>
  <text start="298.409" dur="5.19">his report now Russia said that we</text>
  <text start="301.229" dur="4.8">needed to look at this report so we can</text>
  <text start="303.599" dur="4.261">see what it really says now they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.029" dur="3.63">released it to the public yet it has</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.039">only gone to Russia the United States</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="4.891">and others and when Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="312.899" dur="4.74">read the report they rejected the</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="6.449">findings by the un-led investigation</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="7.17">that claims that Syria used chlorine gas</text>
  <text start="320.999" dur="5.611">in the two attacks in 2014-2015 what</text>
  <text start="324.809" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re saying is that the conclusion</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="3.059">like any physical evidence now the</text>
  <text start="328.259" dur="4.53">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="6.5">they are famous in doing this type of</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="7.261">thing where they will show pictures of</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="7.42">what happened but they&amp;#39;ll never have a</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="7.219">link to who caused it and it looks like</text>
  <text start="343.589" dur="11.461">this is exactly what they did once again</text>
  <text start="347.269" dur="12.01">now they had individuals testify what</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="6.209">happened the report was totally based on</text>
  <text start="359.279" dur="4.59">witness presented by terrorists armed</text>
  <text start="361.259" dur="3.33">groups you know the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="363.869" dur="7.17">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="364.589" dur="9.03">central bankers control and the Russian</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="5.88">ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the</text>
  <text start="373.619" dur="6.36">following that we have a very serious</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="7.77">question to ask over the investigation</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="7.56">findings the panel should investigate</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="6.38">further because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="6.45">now is that there are a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="391.069" dur="6.31">about this report there are no</text>
  <text start="393.989" dur="7.11">fingerprints of who really did this and</text>
  <text start="397.379" dur="7.01">the report doesn&amp;#39;t name anybody there</text>
  <text start="401.099" dur="8.25">are no specifics there&amp;#39;s no names</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="7.63">there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing there is</text>
  <text start="409.349" dur="4.65">nobody to sanction in the report but the</text>
  <text start="412.019" dur="6.42">UK and France came out and said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.999" dur="10.31">going to play sanctions on Syria this</text>
  <text start="418.439" dur="11.94">whole thing is a smoking gun it is a</text>
  <text start="424.309" dur="7.26">fake phony false UN report the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="430.379" dur="5.5">using it as</text>
  <text start="431.569" dur="6.99">buganda to put pressure again on Syria</text>
  <text start="435.879" dur="5.77">so when they go to the next Geneva talks</text>
  <text start="438.559" dur="5.94">they can say Assad used chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="441.649" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ve done this before this is nothing</text>
  <text start="444.499" dur="5.28">new actually they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="446.929" dur="7.83">exact playbook once again and of course</text>
  <text start="449.779" dur="8.43">when the u.s. is asked by Russia please</text>
  <text start="454.759" dur="5.91">show us where the link is that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="458.209" dur="6.031">the whole thing falls apart they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.669" dur="8.28">provide the link that Assad did this all</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="7.469">they can show is the aftermath and the</text>
  <text start="468.949" dur="4.381">aftermath doesn&amp;#39;t prove who did it it</text>
  <text start="471.709" dur="6.061">just shows you what happened when the</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="5.699">chlorine gas was used so we can see</text>
  <text start="477.77" dur="3.449">right now the u.s. is trying to</text>
  <text start="479.029" dur="3.63">discredit Damascus before the Geneva</text>
  <text start="481.219" dur="6.57">talks and they&amp;#39;re trying to use this</text>
  <text start="482.659" dur="8.85">chemical UN report to use this as</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="5.58">leverage when they go into the talks now</text>
  <text start="491.509" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the main event</text>
  <text start="493.369" dur="4.23">and for those people who don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="494.929" dur="7.23">the main event is it is the ultimate</text>
  <text start="497.599" dur="9.81">false flag when all else fails and the</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="9.3">economy starts to collapse and the</text>
  <text start="507.409" dur="6.99">system starts to come down the central</text>
  <text start="511.459" dur="6.36">bankers they will need to blame this on</text>
  <text start="514.399" dur="5.19">another group or country and we see that</text>
  <text start="517.819" dur="4.231">the Islamic state is being beaten and</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="4.35">right now it most likely might not be</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="3.93">the Islamic state so we can see they</text>
  <text start="523.939" dur="4.441">might choose a country at this point in</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="6.63">time and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="7.11">propaganda out there in the corporate</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="9.599">media now they&amp;#39;re saying that the Swiss</text>
  <text start="535.49" dur="9.93">system well it was hacked into and of</text>
  <text start="542.209" dur="4.831">course everyone is warning the banks and</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="5.479">everyone else we need to beef up</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="6.12">security in face of the ongoing attacks</text>
  <text start="550.899" dur="5.37">now it didn&amp;#39;t name what banks were</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="6.179">affected but they did list what happened</text>
  <text start="556.269" dur="5.711">attackers use malware to circumvent the</text>
  <text start="559.339" dur="6.091">banks local security systems they gained</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="5.52">access to the Swift messaging network</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="4.8">and the fraudulent messages were sent</text>
  <text start="567.5" dur="6.75">via Swift to initiate cash transfers</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="6.06">from accounts at larger banks now the</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="4.68">question is why are they doing this at</text>
  <text start="576.29" dur="6.44">this point they want you to understand</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="8.279">that all these systems can be hacked</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="8.799">remember when the country is cyber</text>
  <text start="587.209" dur="7.291">attack it is an act of war now NATO has</text>
  <text start="591.529" dur="6.81">declared a cyber attack an act of war so</text>
  <text start="594.5" dur="6.45">has the United States and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="598.339" dur="8.94">this propaganda right now to convince</text>
  <text start="600.95" dur="10.28">you that the financial system can be</text>
  <text start="607.279" dur="8.341">hacked and the system can come down now</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="7.75">from all of this they are saying that</text>
  <text start="615.62" dur="7.17">most likely this is all linked to North</text>
  <text start="618.98" dur="7.38">Korea so they&amp;#39;re already planting seeds</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="5.22">in people&amp;#39;s minds of who is about to do</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="4.32">this now we know they&amp;#39;ve been provoking</text>
  <text start="628.01" dur="4.14">North Korea they know eventually will be</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="3.029">in war with North Korea because this is</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="3.39">part of their plan they know eventually</text>
  <text start="633.709" dur="4.651">will be in war with Russia that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="5.91">Russia has been implicated in malware</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="5.79">and cyber attacks against the power</text>
  <text start="641.45" dur="5.34">infrastructure we know that will be in</text>
  <text start="644.15" dur="4.59">war with China and what they&amp;#39;re doing at</text>
  <text start="646.79" dur="5.52">this point is they&amp;#39;re building up the</text>
  <text start="648.74" dur="6.24">propaganda so you understand who the</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="3.96">players are now we know who the players</text>
  <text start="654.98" dur="2.85">are because we&amp;#39;ve been talking about it</text>
  <text start="656.27" dur="4.68">for a very long time but they want the</text>
  <text start="657.83" dur="6.42">American public to understand who the</text>
  <text start="660.95" dur="5.4">players are now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="664.25" dur="3.69">they have to read every little thing</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="4.65">they just need to hear the words in</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="6.48">North Korea Russia China as long as they</text>
  <text start="671" dur="6.959">hear those countries the seed has been</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="7.7">planted and we can see they planted the</text>
  <text start="677.959" dur="10.231">seed for what is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="682.12" dur="10.089">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is bring the</text>
  <text start="688.19" dur="5.639">financial system down they will shut</text>
  <text start="692.209" dur="4.351">things down because they&amp;#39;ll say there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="693.829" dur="4.831">malware they&amp;#39;ll keep things off for</text>
  <text start="696.56" dur="2.7">quite a while they&amp;#39;ll call it a bank</text>
  <text start="698.66" dur="2.16">holiday</text>
  <text start="699.26" dur="3.84">most likely they&amp;#39;ll do it on a Friday</text>
  <text start="700.82" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;ll go through the weekend will say</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="3.63">everything will be up and running on</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="4.38">Monday and things will never return to</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="5.07">normal this is what happened in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="708.56" dur="5.58">and all they&amp;#39;re doing now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="5.31">creating the stories they&amp;#39;re laying the</text>
  <text start="714.14" dur="6.36">groundwork for what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="5.55">and that is the main event now we</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="4.38">understand the neocons the elite the</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="5.73">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="724.88" dur="5.88">up this system they want the system to</text>
  <text start="728.39" dur="3.87">continue on and eventually they</text>
  <text start="730.76" dur="5.49">understand they need to restart this</text>

  <text start="736.25" dur="4.65">the system can&amp;#39;t continue forever this</text>
  <text start="737.99" dur="5.25">is why they made plans way back to go</text>

  <text start="800.63" dur="5.43">bring it down now why do they want to</text>
  <text start="803" dur="5.34">bring it down while they understand that</text>
  <text start="806.06" dur="4.98">the system can&amp;#39;t continue on they</text>
  <text start="808.34" dur="5.33">realize eventually it will come down by</text>
  <text start="811.04" dur="4.97">itself I know people can&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="813.67" dur="5.8">think it&amp;#39;s just going to go on forever</text>
  <text start="816.01" dur="4.78">with debt continually rising and these</text>
  <text start="819.47" dur="2.73">countries trying to take back their</text>

  <text start="827.06" dur="2.79">that happens the whole system falls</text>
  <text start="828.35" dur="4.77">apart and we see this happening right</text>
  <text start="829.85" dur="4.83">now the United States is</text>
  <text start="833.12" dur="4.77">in country after country after country</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="7.44">they realize that what they&amp;#39;re up</text>

  <text start="842.12" dur="4.2">realize that they&amp;#39;re losing control the</text>
  <text start="844.7" dur="3.63">Middle East this is why the United</text>

  <text start="851.6" dur="6.66">long enough as we approach this fall now</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="5.13">do we think that something major is</text>
  <text start="858.26" dur="4.079">going to happen this fall maybe a lot of</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="3.21">indicators are pointing to it we have</text>
  <text start="862.339" dur="3.301">the economy deteriorating we have the</text>
  <text start="864.14" dur="3.81">United States government losing control</text>
  <text start="865.64" dur="5.22">in the Middle East and they&amp;#39;re provoking</text>
  <text start="867.95" dur="4.82">war all over the globe we see in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="870.86" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for an</text>
  <text start="872.77" dur="7.39">offensive there&amp;#39;s shelling going on</text>
  <text start="875.66" dur="7.73">they&amp;#39;ve already tried in Crimea and we</text>
  <text start="880.16" dur="5.76">can see that they have the green light</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="5.29">now we understand the elections are</text>
  <text start="885.92" dur="6.87">coming up and they want to stay in</text>
  <text start="888.68" dur="6.54">control they don&amp;#39;t want someone out of</text>
  <text start="892.79" dur="5.22">left field coming in messing everything</text>
  <text start="895.22" dur="5.82">up yet can they get rid of them yes like</text>
  <text start="898.01" dur="4.769">there can be an assassination but they</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="4.26">would like to have the candidate that</text>
  <text start="902.779" dur="5.911">they know will do what they want bring</text>
  <text start="905.3" dur="6.33">us to war I mean we&amp;#39;re going to warn no</text>
  <text start="908.69" dur="8.69">matter what but they want it on their</text>
  <text start="911.63" dur="10.53">terms so the Washington Post came out</text>
  <text start="917.38" dur="8.89">with an article saying that Putin plans</text>
  <text start="922.16" dur="9.84">and october surprise now of course there</text>
  <text start="926.27" dur="9.39">is no evidence whatsoever about Putin</text>
  <text start="932" dur="7.709">being involved in this at all the whole</text>
  <text start="935.66" dur="10.049">thing&amp;#39;s fabricated why would Russia get</text>
  <text start="939.709" dur="8.671">involved they wouldn&amp;#39;t and we can see</text>
  <text start="945.709" dur="5.391">already they&amp;#39;re using the excuse that</text>
  <text start="948.38" dur="5.82">the voter registration system was hacked</text>
  <text start="951.1" dur="5.89">of course by Russia now of course</text>
  <text start="954.2" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s no evidence I know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.99" dur="4.46">producing IP addresses anybody can pick</text>
  <text start="959.3" dur="4.26">an IP address out of the blue and say ah</text>
  <text start="961.45" dur="4.82">yes this is the one we got from Russia</text>
  <text start="963.56" dur="5.5">it&amp;#39;s very easy to do</text>
  <text start="966.27" dur="5.73">but again the United States always fails</text>
  <text start="969.06" dur="5.51">in their investigation when they try to</text>
  <text start="972" dur="7.08">link everything where did it come from</text>
  <text start="974.57" dur="6.64">what place did it go and to get the</text>
  <text start="979.08" dur="5.58">information so quickly it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="981.21" dur="5.01">impossible they know this every time</text>
  <text start="984.66" dur="3.93">they come out and they say oh we were</text>
  <text start="986.22" dur="5.61">just cyber attacked and they come out</text>
  <text start="988.59" dur="5.4">with who did it it&amp;#39;s fake because if</text>
  <text start="991.83" dur="5.34">that is the case think about this for a</text>
  <text start="993.99" dur="5.88">second every single company that was</text>
  <text start="997.17" dur="6.15">hacked into they would know in a split</text>
  <text start="999.87" dur="8.55">second who it was most of the time they</text>
  <text start="1003.32" dur="8.4">can&amp;#39;t even find the hackers they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1008.42" dur="6.3">find the criminals who did it sometimes</text>
  <text start="1011.72" dur="6.78">through investigation over years they</text>
  <text start="1014.72" dur="6.51">might eventually narrow it down but to</text>
  <text start="1018.5" dur="5.52">have that answer so quickly completely</text>
  <text start="1021.23" dur="4.65">impossible so what could be this october</text>
  <text start="1024.02" dur="3.42">surprise well it&amp;#39;s very close to the</text>
  <text start="1025.88" dur="5.43">elections because we know the elections</text>
  <text start="1027.44" dur="9.11">are in the first week of november now</text>
  <text start="1031.31" dur="8.899">could this be a hit against the voter</text>
  <text start="1036.55" dur="8.02">system the electronic voting system</text>
  <text start="1040.209" dur="6.971">maybe because we know what they are</text>
  <text start="1044.57" dur="5.43">going to do if the situation is not</text>
  <text start="1047.18" dur="6.69">going in the direction they want they</text>
  <text start="1050" dur="8.19">need to blame someone they always like</text>
  <text start="1053.87" dur="7.23">to blame somebody else and especially</text>
  <text start="1058.19" dur="8.07">when it comes to something like this or</text>
  <text start="1061.1" dur="6.84">the financial collapse or war so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1066.26" dur="7.28">already laying the groundwork to blame</text>
  <text start="1067.94" dur="10.53">Putin for this and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1073.54" dur="7.24">they have a bigger plan and it looks</text>
  <text start="1078.47" dur="5.34">like since everything is falling apart</text>
  <text start="1080.78" dur="7.47">and they&amp;#39;re racing against time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1083.81" dur="6.99">bigger plan is maybe to collapse the</text>
  <text start="1088.25" dur="5.4">system now I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1090.8" dur="5.69">happen this fall I&amp;#39;m saying this could</text>
  <text start="1093.65" dur="5.82">be their plan because we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1096.49" dur="6.04">indicators pointing to this we</text>
  <text start="1099.47" dur="7.53">a lot of things going on at this time</text>
  <text start="1102.53" dur="8.25">and they are racing against the clock</text>
  <text start="1107" dur="5.61">here because out in Syria they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1110.78" dur="3.899">not making any type of headway the war</text>
  <text start="1112.61" dur="6.14">has been going on for a very long time</text>
  <text start="1114.679" dur="7.141">and they still have to get into Iran and</text>
  <text start="1118.75" dur="6.07">we can see right now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1121.82" dur="5.37">nowhere in Syria they&amp;#39;ll never get Assad</text>
  <text start="1124.82" dur="4.979">out of power unless they sent in a</text>
  <text start="1127.19" dur="4.77">sniper hit team and they actually take</text>
  <text start="1129.799" dur="3.301">him out they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="1131.96" dur="4.29">remove them through the political</text>
  <text start="1133.1" dur="5.78">process the people will vote him in they</text>
  <text start="1136.25" dur="5.22">see him as a war hero they know this</text>
  <text start="1138.88" dur="6.549">Russia is involved they have troops on</text>
  <text start="1141.47" dur="9.329">the ground they set up no-fly zones in</text>
  <text start="1145.429" dur="10.411">the entire area the planes would be shot</text>
  <text start="1150.799" dur="7.441">down with their s400 s500 systems they</text>
  <text start="1155.84" dur="6.089">know this they&amp;#39;re dead in the water</text>
  <text start="1158.24" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re losing control in each and every</text>
  <text start="1161.929" dur="6.151">one of these Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="1163.1" dur="10.079">which is a threat to the petro dollar if</text>
  <text start="1168.08" dur="11.94">the petro dollar collapses the system is</text>
  <text start="1173.179" dur="8.601">doomed if they allow the people in these</text>
  <text start="1180.02" dur="5.72">countries to take their countries back</text>
  <text start="1181.78" dur="7.029">the system is doomed they know this and</text>
  <text start="1185.74" dur="6.25">when I say allow it means they overrun</text>
  <text start="1188.809" dur="5.25">the forces of the coalition forces the</text>
  <text start="1191.99" dur="4.38">puppet government and actually they just</text>
  <text start="1194.059" dur="4.341">lose control we see it happening in</text>
  <text start="1196.37" dur="4.679">Yemen we see it happening in Libya</text>
  <text start="1198.4" dur="5.769">everything they tried isn&amp;#39;t working</text>
  <text start="1201.049" dur="5.641">actually the Iraqi people are fighting</text>
  <text start="1204.169" dur="7.081">back they want the US government and</text>
  <text start="1206.69" dur="5.94">their puppet government out of power so</text>
  <text start="1211.25" dur="5.28">they know they&amp;#39;re racing against time</text>
  <text start="1212.63" dur="6.029">that what they have tried to do has not</text>
  <text start="1216.53" dur="3.629">worked they planned on going into each</text>
