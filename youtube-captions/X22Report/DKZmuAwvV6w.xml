  <text start="102.479" dur="4.611">collapse news now back in 2008 we</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="3.809">understand these subprime securities</text>
  <text start="107.09" dur="4.419">they were complete garbage but we know</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="4.471">the rating agencies they rated them as</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="4.381">triple-a everyone believed that these</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="4.62">were fantastic investments even the</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="7.53">pension funds they purchased these type</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="9.69">of securities and earlier this month we</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="7.95">saw 210 million worth of bonds well they</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="7.829">were stuffed with risky mortgages and</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="6.99">they were given a triple-a rating now</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="4.861">this is one of the first times since the</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="6.27">banking crisis that such a product has</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="7.59">been awarded a prime grade now this</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="6.81">sounds really familiar these are the</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="7.17">same financial products junk mortgage</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="6.48">bonds with again with a rating that</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="5.58">makes no sense and this is what</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="5.49">triggered the crash in 2008 the new</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="4.62">bonds in question are backed by</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="4.26">unqualified mortgages these are loans</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.95">secured with a simple bank&amp;#39;s name and no</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="4.74">tax returns very little vetting even</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="3.87">Moody&amp;#39;s the rating firm that certainly</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="4.109">held riskier also known as subprime</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="4.109">mortgage bonds at triple-a before the</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="4.981">crash considers this type of loans risky</text>
  <text start="178.769" dur="3.721">yet the mortgages are now finding their</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="3.38">way into the triple-a</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="6">bond which means they could soon be in</text>
  <text start="184.88" dur="8.23">pensions and retirement savings once</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="7.71">again so here we are today with the same</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.64">exact thing happening and there are two</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="7.17">rating firms at the center of all this</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="6.54">DBRS and fitch ratings and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="5.79">the first time they&amp;#39;ve raided risky</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="7.05">bonds and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="6.78">whole thing is starting to look just</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="6.81">like 2008 again and we are definitely</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="5.16">headed in that direction and things are</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="4.47">really starting to escalate right now</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="5.3">because we can see right now all bets</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="6.21">are off they&amp;#39;re setting up the economy</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="5.86">they are pushing the stock market over</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="6.18">20,000 I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if it</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="5.37">hits it right before the New Year&amp;#39;s we</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="3.69">see unemployment down to four point six</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="5.46">percent gdp has been shoved up to three</text>
  <text start="239.7" dur="5.76">point five percent and here we are with</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="4.44">these same type of investments again and</text>
  <text start="245.46" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re heading into the same exact</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="3.54">territory because what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="4.49">they don&amp;#39;t care anymore because they</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="6.03">know the systems coming down we see</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="5.41">Obama while he quietly signed the</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="6.62">countering disinformation and propaganda</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="7.05">Act into law laid on Friday after hours</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.68">everyone was thinking about the holiday</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="5.13">weekend he decided to sign the National</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="3.75">Defense Authorization Act which</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.73">authorizes about six hundred and eleven</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="8.19">billion for the military in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="276.23" dur="9.37">this also allows the US to create the</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="7.08">Ministry of Truth it&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="285.6" dur="5.13">countering information warfare act but</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="5.25">really what is it it&amp;#39;s the Ministry of</text>
  <text start="290.73" dur="6.62">Truth where they&amp;#39;re going to crack down</text>
  <text start="293.67" dur="7.98">on fake news they&amp;#39;re going to create</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="6.67">propaganda and also within the NDA we</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.96">see that there&amp;#39;s a provision which</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="3.36">allows the Pentagon to start research</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="5.24">development test evaluation of</text>
  <text start="307.38" dur="7.11">space-based systems for missile defense</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="5.5">now this could unsettle the decades-old</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="5.3">balance of power among the major new</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="7.11">clear States and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="5.65">starting a new arms race and we can see</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="3.51">that Russia China and other countries</text>
  <text start="325.44" dur="4.1">are going to look at this and say hmm</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="5.52">what is the United States doing here and</text>
  <text start="329.54" dur="5.79">we can see right now this is all being</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="6.23">done because they are pushing war</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;re pushing it full steam ahead and</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop and I say they</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="4.11">the central bankers the elite they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="6.42">not going to stop until they get the war</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="7.2">they want we see on friday the United</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="5.58">States abstain from the vote where it</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="5.76">said the settlements in Palestine were</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="5.43">completely illegal and now Israel while</text>
  <text start="358.29" dur="4.89">they lashed out and they have suspended</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.53">their multi-million dollar contribution</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="5.25">to a number of United Nations bodies and</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="5.76">it is reevaluate insh apat the</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="4.05">organization we see out in Ukraine it</text>
  <text start="371.01" dur="2.85">looks like Kiev is doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="372.48" dur="3.33">that the paid mercenaries have been</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="3.24">doing and when I say the paid</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="3.3">mercenaries I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="377.1" dur="4.38">terrorists that were in Syria in Iraq</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.68">and Afghanistan of course we know the</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="4.65">United States government the central</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="4.89">bankers the coalition forces they</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="4.65">support them they fund them and it looks</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="3.42">like Kiev is doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="3.15">because as we know the United States</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="5.12">government central bankers they support</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="7.28">those individuals in Kiev they are using</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="7.03">people as human shields to seize</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="5.14">territories in Don bass the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="4.65">Armed Forces they&amp;#39;re continually seizing</text>
  <text start="406.35" dur="3.9">villages in the gray zone and we can see</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="4.98">the southeastern people they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="6.93">on the OSCE to influence Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="5.39">withdraw their units and stop these</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="7.02">threats and stop using civilians as</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="6.76">shields we see out in Iraq where Obama</text>
  <text start="424.2" dur="5.82">promised there&amp;#39;ll be no boots on the</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="6.42">ground the military personnel won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="5.67">fighting on the front lines well over</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="5.16">five thousand US servicemen who were</text>
  <text start="435.69" dur="3.9">deployed in Iraq well they&amp;#39;re embedded</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="6.48">with the coalition fighters on the front</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="6.03">lines and we can see right now that when</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="3.09">they say no boots on the ground it</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="3.69">really means the opposite they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="447.18" dur="2.85">to be boots on the ground and we have</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="3.74">thousands</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="8.34">and thousands of soldiers in iraq in</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="8.32">this area to keep control of iraq make</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="4.47">sure the people are pushed back and we</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="2.91">see this happening in Libya we see it</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="4.29">happening in Yemen we see it happen in</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="3.78">Sudan and right now what is happening in</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="3.18">the Middle East the United States</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="4.05">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="4.32">losing control of the entire situation</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.01">remember their plan was to capture all</text>
  <text start="474.63" dur="3.99">these areas replace the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="3.81">keep the petrodollar propped up go into</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="4.77">Syria and eventually go into Iran well</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="6.3">it looks like their plans have failed in</text>
  <text start="483.39" dur="6.33">Syria they&amp;#39;re failing in other countries</text>
  <text start="487.23" dur="5.25">and this is a huge threat to the petro</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="4.91">dollar and it looks like the central</text>
  <text start="492.48" dur="4.83">bankers right now they are losing</text>
  <text start="494.63" dur="5.53">rapidly in this area Russia&amp;#39;s coming in</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="6.15">right now and they are expanding their</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="6.42">naval base in Syria this is the naval</text>
  <text start="503.46" dur="6.27">base in Tartus in Syria and they are</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="6.42">creating a much larger naval base to</text>
  <text start="509.73" dur="4.8">hold control in this area we see the</text>
  <text start="513" dur="4.77">United States is issuing wardens</text>
  <text start="514.53" dur="5.31">warnings in Jordan warning individuals</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="4.35">not to travel to Jordan because of</text>
  <text start="519.84" dur="3.66">terrorist threats we also see the US</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="4.38">State Department is warning Americans</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="5.82">against traveling to Egypt remember</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="6.27">Egypt was supposed to push off the vote</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="6.84">about these settlements in Palestine and</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="5.34">it looks like right now that Egypt is at</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="5.46">the center of this and we might see</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="5.97">terror threats within that country who</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="4.62">are these mostly coming from i would say</text>
  <text start="544.08" dur="5.96">Israel because Egypt didn&amp;#39;t live up to</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="7.11">the promise of pushing this vote off and</text>
  <text start="550.04" dur="5.55">the vote went through and we can see</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="5.21">that Israel is very angry at this point</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="7.33">we see that a Russian military plane</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="6.64">crash on route to Syria killing 92 on</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="5.04">board this was the red army choir</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="4.83">singers they were going to Syria to the</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="6">bases there they were going to sing to</text>
  <text start="570.03" dur="7.86">the Troops for Christmas and they were</text>
  <text start="573.96" dur="6.27">flying in a tu-154 tupolev plane and it</text>
  <text start="577.89" dur="4.02">disappeared from their radar screens two</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="3.539">minutes after taking off from sochi in</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="4.979">southern russia</text>
  <text start="583.769" dur="7.86">and we see right now that either this</text>
  <text start="586.889" dur="8.581">was a mechanical failure or the plane</text>
  <text start="591.629" dur="8.031">was brought down and it was brought down</text>
  <text start="595.47" dur="7.079">by different agencies to send a message</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="6.159">to Russia remember what happened in the</text>
  <text start="602.549" dur="6.66">past week we&amp;#39;ve had the Russian</text>

  <text start="628.709" dur="4.47">failure we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but we</text>
  <text start="631.439" dur="5.101">can see that this is a strange</text>
  <text start="633.179" dur="5.16">coincidence that has occurred and we</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="4.169">know right now that the u.s. government</text>
