  <text start="50.3" dur="5.879">x-wing to report my name is david is</text>
  <text start="52.219" dur="6.991">episode 1263 a in today&amp;#39;s days April</text>
  <text start="56.179" dur="5.52">25th 2017 and the part of the episode is</text>
  <text start="59.21" dur="4.86">the central bankers tricks are now being</text>
  <text start="61.699" dur="5.49">used against them to bring the economy</text>
  <text start="64.07" dur="6.15">down let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="67.189" dur="5.881">collapse financial news now today we see</text>
  <text start="70.22" dur="6.75">the market well it is surged up quite a</text>
  <text start="73.07" dur="6.24">bit goal brought down once again and we</text>
  <text start="76.97" dur="4.289">can see that these bubbles that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="79.31" dur="4.619">been watching for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="81.259" dur="6.841">are inflating very very quickly right</text>
  <text start="83.929" dur="6.211">now and we can see that things are not</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="3.689">going well in the economy we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="90.14" dur="2.729">looking at this for quite a while and we</text>
  <text start="91.789" dur="3.39">can see that things are continually</text>
  <text start="92.869" dur="4.29">breaking down now consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="95.179" dur="3.78">this is coming from the conference board</text>
  <text start="97.159" dur="3.031">remember this is the conference board</text>
  <text start="98.959" dur="3.421">which receives grants from the</text>
  <text start="100.19" dur="3.719">government and they like to tell the</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="2.79">story the way the government wants to</text>
  <text start="103.909" dur="3">tell the story that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="105.17" dur="3.839">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="106.909" dur="6.24">consumer confidence index well it is</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="7.291">dropped in April and the notable drop is</text>
  <text start="113.149" dur="5.941">in expectations in business conditions</text>
  <text start="116.3" dur="5.37">because they are weakening right now now</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="4.41">when we look at the gallop consumer</text>
  <text start="121.67" dur="3.959">confidence we can see that gallop</text>
  <text start="123.5" dur="4.769">consumer confidence is much much lower</text>
  <text start="125.629" dur="4.44">than the conference board consumer</text>
  <text start="128.269" dur="3.72">confidence and this has been going on</text>
  <text start="130.069" dur="4.321">for quite a while but we can see right</text>
  <text start="131.989" dur="4.651">now that the conference board well that</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="5.429">consumer confidence it is dropping right</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="5.19">now and we see that there are more and</text>
  <text start="139.819" dur="3.541">more retail stores where they&amp;#39;re laying</text>
  <text start="141.83" dur="2.909">off individuals are saying old bits</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="2.909">because of online everyone shopping</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="3.33">online remember each one of these</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="5.521">businesses they have an online presence</text>
  <text start="148.069" dur="5.731">and maybe they should be doing</text>
  <text start="151.79" dur="3.96">fantastically if everything is going to</text>
  <text start="153.8" dur="3.54">online because if everyone is switching</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="3.36">from brick-and-mortar their entire</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="3.149">business not just brick and mortar but</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="3.599">their online their brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="5.161">should be doing incredible because</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re purchasing a lot of items on</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="3.93">their online service but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="3.599">seeing this actually the overall for</text>
  <text start="169.58" dur="3.659">each one of these companies is doing</text>
  <text start="171.349" dur="4.981">very poorly this is why we see</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="4.021">bankruptcies today and j crew right now</text>
  <text start="176.33" dur="3.93">is saying that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="3.9">cutting about 150 jobs because sales are</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="3.15">in reach</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="5.04">eat and they&amp;#39;re starting to trim costs</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="5.7">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this with many retail</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="6.21">stores right now now we see case-shiller</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="7.23">is out there and they are saying that</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="6.69">from the top 20 cities that the price of</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="5.88">homes they have risen by five point nine</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="6.63">percent and this is the highest increase</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="7.53">since july of 2014 and of course as we</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="8.1">know they use these 20 cities to pump up</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="6.21">the bubble and they use it to make</text>
  <text start="213.83" dur="4.11">everyone believe that the housing market</text>
  <text start="215.96" dur="4.68">is doing fine actually if you look at</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="5.82">the graph and you can see the home</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="6.93">prices you see back in 2012 going into</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="6.9">2013 we hit a peak of home prices and</text>
  <text start="227.57" dur="5.34">since that point into the mid of say</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="4.98">twenty fourteen or so housing prices</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="6.6">dropped dramatically and since the mid</text>
  <text start="235.64" dur="5.82">of 2014 up until the present day housing</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.68">prices really haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere</text>
  <text start="241.46" dur="5.94">actually it is like it&amp;#39;s flat line right</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="5.91">now and they&amp;#39;re also telling us that new</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="5.72">home sales they have jumped and they</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="6.54">have tied for the highest since weight</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="6.79">2008 well we know what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="5.82">right before the entire system fell</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="6.12">apart they were telling us how great</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="6.69">housing was that home sales were selling</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="6.12">like crazy they were building like crazy</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="6.6">but again when you look at the graph and</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="6.69">you go back to two thousand nine new</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="6.69">home sales it&amp;#39;s not even close to where</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="7.44">was back in 2006 2000 of it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="282.44" dur="6.18">halfway to that point so housing sales</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="3.99">have gone nowhere why couldn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="4.41">bring it to the point where we were once</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="4.5">before because this is being driven by</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="3.72">hedge fund&amp;#39;s investment companies</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="4.74">foreign investors this is not being</text>
  <text start="296.75" dur="4.95">driven by the American people and this</text>
  <text start="299.51" dur="4.8">is why they could never get it to where</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="5.07">it was all they could do is get certain</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="5.04">cities to a certain level to convince</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="5.79">the population that the housing market</text>
  <text start="309.35" dur="4.8">is back but it isn&amp;#39;t actually if you</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="2.16">look at these cities there are so many</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="2.22">homes</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="3.72">for sale right now and many of their</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="3.84">houses they are lowering the prices and</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="4.74">there on the market longer and longer</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="5.25">and longer and things are really not</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="4.29">going well in the real estate market now</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="4.14">people who are living in these 20 cities</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to continually push the</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="4.68">bubble to the extreme until it pops and</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="3.96">those individuals that are in these 20</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="3.54">cities well they&amp;#39;re going to come</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="3.66">tumbling down and most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="3.21">going to be the hardest hit because</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="5.01">those are the cities those are the areas</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="6">that have been pumped up the most and if</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="6.15">we go back in time to California in that</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="7.05">area Florida Miami region those areas</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="5.25">were hit very very hard but again the</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="4.05">same areas that were hit very very hard</text>
  <text start="355.88" dur="3.93">they went into those areas and they</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="4.29">started pumping it up again and we can</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="4.74">see there&amp;#39;s a lot of speculators the big</text>
  <text start="362.42" dur="3.93">investment companies now are selling off</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="5.4">because the insiders know we&amp;#39;ve hit the</text>
  <text start="366.35" dur="7.37">top the top has passed we need to sell</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="7.35">them to the retail investor speculators</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="6.01">mom-and-pop flip-floppers and they are</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="4.83">the ones who are holding these homes</text>
  <text start="379.73" dur="5.79">which is going to be a disaster as we</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="5.85">move forward now Trump he is going to</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="5.97">order a corporate tax rate cut of about</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="6.33">fifteen percent and Trump told staff he</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="4.8">wants a massive tax cut to sell to the</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="4.5">American people and he said it was less</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="5.43">important to him if the plan loses</text>
  <text start="398.81" dur="4.44">revenue now the proposal which is going</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="3.66">to face fierce pushback from the</text>
  <text start="403.25" dur="5.43">conservatives as it is nothing more than</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="6.21">a continuation of what Obama was already</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="5.22">doing so this is nothing new he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="5.79">along with the deep state with the</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="5.7">central bankers and they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="417.38" dur="3.81">exact same thing now keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="419.6" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing it</text>
  <text start="421.19" dur="4.729">sounds terrible but we&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="5.16">out what is really going on here now</text>
  <text start="425.919" dur="5.771">Trump&amp;#39;s massive tax cut will be funded</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="5.58">by debt and as a result will be at best</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="3.6">temporary as it will be in breach of the</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="3.87">revenue constraints and the</text>
  <text start="435.29" dur="4.89">reconciliation process at worst it will</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.62">never happen as it will now require</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="5.28">Democrat to vote but it&amp;#39;s funny because</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="5.519">this is what Obama was pushing for all</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="4.65">along now Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.129" dur="3.9">he&amp;#39;s going to announce a 20-percent</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="4.44">tariff on Canadian softwood lumber</text>
  <text start="452.029" dur="4.5">imports the tariff will be applied</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="4.439">retroactively lien imposed on canadian</text>
  <text start="456.529" dur="5.551">exports to the u.s. of about five</text>
  <text start="458.989" dur="5.061">billion a year and he said we tried to</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="5.159">negotiate a settlement but were unable</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="5.289">adding that the previous administration</text>
  <text start="467.239" dur="4.53">was also trying to negotiate a</text>
  <text start="469.339" dur="6.03">settlement but they never could resolve</text>
  <text start="471.769" dur="6.99">the dispute so Trump said okay let&amp;#39;s add</text>
  <text start="475.369" dur="7.29">a tariff now it sounds awful it sounds</text>
  <text start="478.759" dur="6.36">terrible and it is in certain respects</text>
  <text start="482.659" dur="4.86">but let&amp;#39;s continue to see what else is</text>
  <text start="485.119" dur="7.26">going on here now we know the debt</text>
  <text start="487.519" dur="6.9">ceiling argument is coming up and we can</text>
  <text start="492.379" dur="3.15">see that the Democrats while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.419" dur="2.881">going to make a really big deal about</text>
  <text start="495.529" dur="3.12">this which it doesn&amp;#39;t matter Republicans</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="3.179">can make a big deal Democrats can make a</text>
  <text start="498.649" dur="3.24">big deal it makes no difference at this</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="5.85">point in time does it really matter if</text>
  <text start="501.889" dur="7.2">the debt ceiling is raised or not no but</text>
  <text start="506.329" dur="5.82">they are going to raise it Trump wants</text>
  <text start="509.089" dur="4.771">it raised he wants more spending and</text>
  <text start="512.149" dur="2.94">people think Wait Wait him and he wants</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="4.619">more spending that&amp;#39;s going to be more</text>
  <text start="515.089" dur="4.62">debt why would he want to do this and of</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="3.331">course what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.709" dur="4.26">saying well he wants this wall built and</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="3.57">if he wants this wall built built he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="2.821">going to want this in the budget and</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="3.509">we&amp;#39;re going to have to look at this is</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.229">going to be an argument so basically he</text>
  <text start="528.889" dur="4.38">came out to listen we can look at this</text>
  <text start="531.019" dur="4.74">later on this year this really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="533.269" dur="4.231">have to be included let&amp;#39;s just pass this</text>
  <text start="535.759" dur="3.721">and get the debt ceiling raised let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="3.86">pass the budget let&amp;#39;s get it all but</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="5.099">when we look at this very closely</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="6.52">Trump&amp;#39;s request that Congress include a</text>
  <text start="544.579" dur="5.851">1.4 billion dollars were to fund the</text>
  <text start="547.88" dur="6.329">beginning of his wall on the us-mexico</text>
  <text start="550.43" dur="6.509">border equals approximately point zero</text>
  <text start="554.209" dur="4.86">three five percent of what the federal</text>
  <text start="556.939" dur="3.601">government will spend in total this year</text>
  <text start="559.069" dur="4.08">according to the latest estimate of</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="4.799">fiscal year 2017 and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="563.149" dur="4.141">the Congressional Budget Office it also</text>
  <text start="565.339" dur="3.99">equals less than Department of Health</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.62">and Human Services spends in just 12</text>
  <text start="569.329" dur="6.63">hours and less than the treasury</text>
  <text start="571.91" dur="5.729">collects in taxes in four hours so when</text>
  <text start="575.959" dur="5.25">we really look at this this is</text>
  <text start="577.639" dur="4.441">meaningless and most likely this is why</text>
  <text start="581.209" dur="2.131">he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="582.08" dur="3.78">okay you know it will look at this later</text>
  <text start="583.34" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s not even that much money but if you</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="4.35">notice they&amp;#39;re starting to make a big</text>
  <text start="588.02" dur="4.29">deal about this and he doesn&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="3.63">to be a big deal he wants this to go</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="3.69">through he wants the budget to go</text>
  <text start="593.84" dur="4.77">through he wants the debt ceiling raised</text>
  <text start="596" dur="5.55">all of this needs to be done and it</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="4.56">seems kind of strange but he needs this</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="3.72">all to be done and I&amp;#39;ll explain this in</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="5.07">a little bit we see right now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="605.27" dur="5.34">tidal wave of inflation that is rapidly</text>
  <text start="608.24" dur="4.23">moving through the financial system the</text>
  <text start="610.61" dur="3.87">Fed is tightening policy by hiking rates</text>
  <text start="612.47" dur="5.07">but the rest of the world central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="6.09">they are continually printing 200</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="4.44">billion in QE every single month and i</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t mean printing with a printing</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="5.34">press or pushing a button yes 200</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="4.98">billion at a time when the financial</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="4.89">system is out of a crisis so why are</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="4.92">they continually creating this currency</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="5.43">if everything is fine well we know that</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="5.52">nothing is fine here this is at an</text>
  <text start="637.64" dur="5.22">all-time record greater even than the</text>
