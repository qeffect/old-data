  <text start="122.039" dur="6.871">be surprised if greece decides to leave</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="5.82">the EU because we see other countries</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="6.78">there heading in that direction now I</text>

  <text start="135.69" dur="4.71">ticked up a little bit to 4.8% and</text>
  <text start="138.319" dur="4.421">everyone is out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="3.99">unemployment is still very strong the</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="3.45">central bank is out that the Fed is out</text>

  <text start="146.19" dur="6.75">very strong but we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="8.46">information that well maybe the US labor</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="5.159">market is not as good as they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="3.42">well we know this we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.099" dur="5.401">completely manipulated we know that</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="7.68">these numbers aren&amp;#39;t truthful but what</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="9.29">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that Deutsche</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="9.3">Bank well they are warning that</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="6.699">America&amp;#39;s biggest companies well</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="6.509">they&amp;#39;re slowing down for the first time</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="8.761">and they&amp;#39;re not hiring as many people</text>
  <text start="183.569" dur="6.78">and this is going to be a problem and</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="4.95">this is casting some serious doubt on</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="7.381">just how strong the hiring environment</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="5.84">is Yahoo&amp;#39;s miles you&amp;#39;d &amp;#39;ln notes that</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="4.1">Deutsche Bank illustrates that</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="5.59">employment at big US companies is</text>
  <text start="201.83" dur="7.48">plunging for the first time since the</text>
  <text start="204.63" dur="8.09">recession and we&amp;#39;ve been watching this</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="7.35">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this we knew this</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="6.67">years ago because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="6.99">numbers and you look at the unemployment</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="6">and you look at the layoffs and you see</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="3.57">what challenger gray and Christmas have</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="4.86">been reporting for many years that</text>
  <text start="227.22" dur="4.769">layoffs are continually happening and we</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.459">continually show they&amp;#39;re just layoffs</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="6.661">that these jobs that are being created</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="5.741">are part-time and the numbers are being</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="3.99">manipulated to make it look like people</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="4.8">have work we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="6.06">truth come out and for the first time</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="7.769">since the recession large companies they</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="7.11">have negative job growth since the</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="6">recession and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="6.09">we start to see all this all the data</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="6.691">that the BLS has been putting out the</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="6.989">central bank I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised of</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.39">this data starts to move in the opposite</text>
  <text start="268.889" dur="6.571">direction where unemployment continually</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="5.1">moves up the corporate media starts to</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.47">come out and start to tell you that</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.939">things aren&amp;#39;t as good as it was before</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="5.489">under Obama because what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="4.741">is they&amp;#39;re preparing for this crash</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re preparing for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="6.15">they need to create this narrative the</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="6.449">story of why all of a sudden this is</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="6.69">happening and you can see how this is</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="8.221">all being prepared now we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="7.85">a recession it&amp;#39;s not if or when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="4.74">already in it it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="3.88">because</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="4.46">a lot of things can be hidden that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="5.07">going on out in the corporate world</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.56">where people are not standing on bread</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="5.16">lines they&amp;#39;re not standing on soup lines</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="6.94">because the government and this is under</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.85">Obama and many other presidents while</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="4.23">they expanded how much people are</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="4.77">receiving so think about all the number</text>
  <text start="330.54" dur="4.5">of people that are in food stamps they</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="3.56">just go to the store and they swipe a</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="5.76">card it looks like a credit card and</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="5.74">nobody knows the difference so you</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="4.47">really have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="4.68">people who have been laid off who are</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.53">not working well they stay very very</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="3.78">quiet you don&amp;#39;t know that this is</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="3.06">happening a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="5.67">admit that they&amp;#39;ve lost the job it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="7.14">embarrassing but there&amp;#39;s many people who</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="6.09">are not working at that same job might</text>
  <text start="360" dur="5.64">be working at a part-time job or living</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="5.67">off their severance right now and hoping</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="6">that they find something but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="5.85">seeing at this point is that things are</text>
  <text start="371.64" dur="4.98">deteriorating very very rapidly and the</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="3.42">stock market well that&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="5.03">indication of anything it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="6.48">indication of manipulation fraud it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="4.06">the government the central bank to</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="3">convince the people that everything is</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="4.29">fine but everything in the background</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.98">everything behind the stock market well</text>
  <text start="390" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s the real economy that&amp;#39;s the real</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="4.05">people and this is why we see everything</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="4.23">contracting right now and when we look</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="4.71">at this we can see that the job numbers</text>
  <text start="399" dur="5.22">are completely fake we see large</text>
  <text start="400.98" dur="4.62">companies well they&amp;#39;re not hiring like</text>
  <text start="404.22" dur="4.62">they used to actually they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="405.6" dur="7.71">negative area and we&amp;#39;re seeing that a</text>
  <text start="408.84" dur="7.47">lot of these statistics that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="6.36">throwing at us well they don&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="6.27">sense anymore and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="419.67" dur="5.01">that they&amp;#39;re shooting for a GDP of 4 to</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="3.81">5 percent first of all they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="4.44">going to reach that it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="5.73">impossible we&amp;#39;re seeing that tax</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="5.49">receipts while they indicate the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="4.47">in a recession gross private domestic</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="4.23">investment indicates we are in a</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="5.06">recession retailers are showing that the</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="4.58">US consumer is tapped out</text>
  <text start="441.65" dur="3.78">ups another</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="5.4">economic bellwether dramatically lowered</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="7.58">its 2017 forecast put simply the real</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="6.27">economy it&amp;#39;s rolling over right now and</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="4.84">we&amp;#39;re going to see the whole thing come</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="5.16">crumbling down now we have Harry dent is</text>
  <text start="457.85" dur="5.97">out there we have Charles menner</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="5.37">we have cliff high all saying that the</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="4.8">market something&amp;#39;s going to happen to</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="6.06">the economy moving into like the third</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="5.04">quarter of this year and Harry dent is</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="4.59">calling for a 50 percent correction</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="4.4">right now and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="3.84">calling for these huge Corrections and</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="4.38">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re in one of the longest economic</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="6.25">expansions in history and you know what</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="6.3">follows these long economic expansions</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="7.95">well they&amp;#39;ve been followed by declines</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="9.75">of 30 percent or more and we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="9.45">third longest in history at 92 months so</text>
  <text start="501.68" dur="6.24">we can see that the odds are in the</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="5.4">favor of the market coming down and</text>
  <text start="507.92" dur="6.63">coming down quite a bit we see london&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.49" dur="5.82">gold bullion market which is centuries</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="5.58">old is said to be seeking transparency</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="6.93">with plans to reveal how much gold</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="6.93">bullion is held in its vaults now i</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="5.79">would like to see this i would like to</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="5.85">see how much gold london actually has</text>
  <text start="530.03" dur="5.1">and the move is being led by the London</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="4.08">bullion market Association and it is</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="5.1">said that it will provide data for the</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="6.72">first time on how much gold is traded in</text>
  <text start="540.23" dur="5.97">the London gold bullion now the question</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="5.96">is why are they doing this now are they</text>
  <text start="546.2" dur="6.48">getting prepared for this new system and</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="8.62">I want I like to see if they actually do</text>
  <text start="552.68" dur="9.09">this now out in Arizona there is a bill</text>
  <text start="558.29" dur="6.99">that would eliminate state capital gain</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="8.16">taxes on gold and silver and encourage</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="7.68">its use as currency now it passed the</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="4.44">House committee this week and final</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="3.689">approval of the legislation would help</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="3.99">undermine the feds</text>
  <text start="576.649" dur="5.011">Irv&amp;#39;s monopoly on money so we see</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="6.029">another state right now pushing in the</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="5.729">same direction gold and silver legal</text>
  <text start="584.389" dur="4.44">tender let&amp;#39;s get rid of the said dollar</text>
  <text start="587.389" dur="4.95">and I&amp;#39;m calling it not even the US</text>
  <text start="588.829" dur="6.24">dollar anymore it is the Fed dollar so</text>
  <text start="592.339" dur="7.8">representative mark Fitch um introduced</text>
  <text start="595.069" dur="7.95">House bill HB 2014 On January 9th the</text>
  <text start="600.139" dur="5.88">legislation would eliminate the capital</text>
  <text start="603.019" dur="6.781">gains and make gold and silver legal</text>
  <text start="606.019" dur="8.16">tender so we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="6.599">they&amp;#39;re doing the same as Utah Texas and</text>
  <text start="614.179" dur="4.801">there are other states that are moving</text>
  <text start="616.399" dur="7.021">in the same direction now the question</text>
  <text start="618.98" dur="8.159">is why are we seeing this happen do they</text>
  <text start="623.42" dur="5.19">know something do they are they looking</text>
  <text start="627.139" dur="3.75">at what&amp;#39;s going on here and saying you</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="4.289">know something the said dollar is done</text>
  <text start="630.889" dur="5.25">we better protect ourselves we better</text>
  <text start="632.899" dur="5.391">have another currency waiting to go live</text>
  <text start="636.139" dur="6.06">because think about it it&amp;#39;s a Fed dollar</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="6.359">completely implodes on itself people can</text>
  <text start="642.199" dur="5.55">use gold and silver to transact business</text>
  <text start="644.649" dur="5.38">now do people have a golden sword that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.749" dur="5.611">a whole nother question and this is why</text>
  <text start="650.029" dur="6.78">all along we&amp;#39;ve been telling people get</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="5.31">your silver get your gold because when</text>
  <text start="656.809" dur="4.44">things start to fall about fall apart</text>
  <text start="658.67" dur="4.289">that paper and ink well that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="661.249" dur="5.46">implode it&amp;#39;s going to be worth nothing</text>
  <text start="662.959" dur="5.701">and gold and silver well that&amp;#39;s physical</text>
  <text start="666.709" dur="5.22">you have it it&amp;#39;s in your hands you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.66" dur="6.029">holding it now Deutsche Bank they are</text>
  <text start="671.929" dur="6.39">out there they took a full-page ad to</text>
  <text start="674.689" dur="6.99">apologize for its market rigging ripping</text>
  <text start="678.319" dur="7.77">many people off and they&amp;#39;re apologizing</text>
  <text start="681.679" dur="6.63">right now trying to get the sympathy of</text>
  <text start="686.089" dur="3.69">the people but we can see right now you</text>
  <text start="688.309" dur="4.71">know what they knew what they were doing</text>
  <text start="689.779" dur="4.951">I know they say they paid billions worth</text>
  <text start="693.019" dur="4.201">of fine but they made most likely</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="5.519">hundreds and hundreds of billions from</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="6.599">doing that so you know something I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.249" dur="5.88">really feel sorry for them we see the EU</text>
  <text start="703.819" dur="4.89">well they&amp;#39;re stepping up the pace for a</text>
  <text start="706.129" dur="4.021">cashless society and they want this</text>
  <text start="708.709" dur="5.341">completed in</text>
  <text start="710.15" dur="7.98">t18 so they&amp;#39;re not even waiting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="8.79">moving forward with their agenda now we</text>
  <text start="718.13" dur="7.94">see mario draghi he is out there and he</text>
  <text start="722.84" dur="5.76">is saying that the european central bank</text>
  <text start="726.07" dur="4.99">well they&amp;#39;re not going to be responsible</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="4.23">for the next financial crisis and we</text>
  <text start="731.06" dur="3.03">said this before the central bankers</text>
  <text start="732.83" dur="6.32">they don&amp;#39;t want to take responsibility</text>
  <text start="734.09" dur="8.51">whatsoever and of course as we know that</text>
  <text start="739.15" dur="9.25">the european central bank</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="8.74">they have about 36% of assets on their</text>
  <text start="748.4" dur="6.93">books and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="751.34" dur="6.27">now is they have a gigantic portfolio or</text>
  <text start="755.33" dur="4.02">roughly about 14 trillion in global</text>
  <text start="757.61" dur="5.94">central bank liquidity sloshing around</text>
  <text start="759.35" dur="6.36">and that I guess that wouldn&amp;#39;t be the</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="4.65">catalyst for this market crash but</text>
  <text start="765.71" dur="5.4">rather they&amp;#39;re looking at Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="768.2" dur="5.76">and saying the reason for the next</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="4.98">financial crisis is going to be because</text>
  <text start="773.96" dur="6.45">of Donald Trump&amp;#39;s deregulation of the</text>
  <text start="776.09" dur="6.72">banking industry and has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="780.41" dur="5.73">with the central bank the central bank</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="5.64">has made a full recovery and if anything</text>
  <text start="786.14" dur="4.23">should happen it&amp;#39;s because of what Trump</text>
  <text start="788.45" dur="4.05">is doing right now now we said this is</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="3.87">where they were going to head this is</text>
  <text start="792.5" dur="3.71">what they were going to do that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="4.5">going to try to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="4">someone else another country another</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="4.77">group now that all fell apart they</text>
  <text start="800.21" dur="5.67">couldn&amp;#39;t blame Russia Trump is talking</text>
  <text start="803.51" dur="4.22">to Putin and that whole story completely</text>
  <text start="805.88" dur="4.14">fell apart with all the cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="807.73" dur="4.66">where Russia&amp;#39;s trying to start war if</text>
  <text start="810.02" dur="5.07">actually if you notice that all those</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="4.89">stories kind of evaporated at this point</text>
  <text start="815.09" dur="4.89">now they&amp;#39;re trying to push Iran and</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="6.12">China but that&amp;#39;s at the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="819.98" dur="7.35">so they need to turn their their whole</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="5.73">entire view point onto Trump to say he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.33" dur="3.75">the one who was responsible now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.13" dur="4.32">waiting for him to go a little bit</text>
  <text start="831.08" dur="5.58">further in what he wants to do he wants</text>
  <text start="833.45" dur="5.82">that they&amp;#39;re waiting for him to push his</text>
  <text start="836.66" dur="3.18">agenda because they can&amp;#39;t do it too soon</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="2.01">to say</text>
  <text start="839.84" dur="3">oh yes the economy just came down</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="2.58">because of Trump because he&amp;#39;s only been</text>
  <text start="842.84" dur="4.02">in there what</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="5.43">13 14 days or so it&amp;#39;s not enough time</text>
