  <text start="81.04" dur="4.62">collapse of the system and I believe</text>
  <text start="83.38" dur="3.51">that we&amp;#39;re already in this recession and</text>
  <text start="85.66" dur="2.52">of course what they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="86.89" dur="4.31">back in time and they&amp;#39;ll tell you oh</text>
  <text start="88.18" dur="5.43">yeah the recession started in 2016 and</text>

  <text start="98.35" dur="4.799">things are breaking down in all</text>
  <text start="100.69" dur="6.06">different sectors and it&amp;#39;s very easy for</text>
  <text start="103.149" dur="5.341">the Fed and the rest to mask all of this</text>
  <text start="106.75" dur="3.899">to make you think that nothing is going</text>
  <text start="108.49" dur="5.31">on that everything is fine but behind</text>
  <text start="110.649" dur="5.761">the scenes behind this illusion that</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="4.05">they put up everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="116.41" dur="4.2">fall apart I mean looking on in</text>

  <text start="144.78" dur="5.98">Argentina&amp;#39;s peso is now in freefall even</text>
  <text start="149.049" dur="4.5">though the central bank raised its</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="7.34">interest rate three times last week to a</text>
  <text start="153.549" dur="7.771">stunning 40% to halt the plunge</text>
  <text start="158.1" dur="5.139">inflation is 25 percent and it might get</text>
  <text start="161.32" dur="3.77">worse and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in</text>
  <text start="163.239" dur="5.431">many different countries and Argentina</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="7.119">continually has problems where basically</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="6.27">they collapse and we&amp;#39;re seeing this and</text>
  <text start="172.209" dur="5.551">there are many other countries that are</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="6.269">going to see the same exact thing right</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="6.03">now the dollar is rallying and the</text>
  <text start="181.209" dur="4.921">Argentine government is asking for a</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="4.44">bailout from the IMF</text>
  <text start="186.13" dur="3.06">and this whole thing is getting worse</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="2.67">and worse</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="4.02">and what&amp;#39;s happening is this currency</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="3.93">crisis is morphing into a debt crisis</text>
  <text start="193.21" dur="4.11">because we&amp;#39;re not just seeing it in</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.94">Argentina we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Brazil in</text>
  <text start="197.32" dur="5.76">Turkey in Russia rising interest rates</text>
  <text start="200.77" dur="4.56">in the US has unleashed competition</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="5.13">among banks for deposits for the first</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="6.66">time in a decade and the Fed is allowing</text>
  <text start="208.21" dur="7.53">it to happen yes they are they want this</text>
  <text start="211.99" dur="6.56">system to implode on itself because they</text>
  <text start="215.74" dur="6.39">realize that it can&amp;#39;t go any further and</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="6.58">they need to transition into a new</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="7.44">system they just need an event they need</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="7.26">a individual a group a country to blame</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="5.22">it on and once they have that well</text>
  <text start="232.39" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to go forward with it we</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="3.87">can see already from a lot of the</text>
  <text start="236.32" dur="4.02">corporate media articles that are out</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="3.51">there they&amp;#39;re already saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.08">Trump&amp;#39;s plans it&amp;#39;s because of this and</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.22">again we&amp;#39;re talking about each side</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="5.07">trying to gain the narrative actually if</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="5.19">we look at some of the hedge funds we</text>
  <text start="249.49" dur="5.1">see that they are now shorting the</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="4.37">entire market they&amp;#39;re saying companies</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="6.11">are going to be going down and that</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="7.81">means we&amp;#39;re headed into a very rough</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="7.42">period and we can see billionaire hedge</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="7.92">fund managers their expectations of</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="6.81">further market disruptions are coming so</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="3.96">we see already that they&amp;#39;re planning on</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="5.28">this they know what&amp;#39;s coming the</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="6.39">insiders always seem to know when things</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="5.19">are going to happen they get a heads-up</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="5.16">they know the inside track of what is</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="3.96">going on and this is how you know when</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="4.05">things are going south</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="4.68">remember the central bankers what they</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="4.14">do is they pump everything up into</text>
  <text start="294.04" dur="4.38">gigantic bubbles then they then they</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="3.69">basically sell everything they have to</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="3.03">retailers because they think the market</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="2.46">is going to continually move up they</text>
  <text start="301.45" dur="2.43">think everything is gonna be great</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="2.43">they&amp;#39;re going to go into housing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="2.46">gonna go into the market they can go</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="4.29">into the bonds they&amp;#39;re gonna go into</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.88">everything and this is when they bring</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="5.4">it all down now it looks like Russia</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re realizing that there is no time</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="3.93">left</text>
  <text start="315.25" dur="4.47">the economy is basically ripping itself</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="3.99">apart breaking</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.71">very very quickly and we can see this</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="4.2">because if and we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="4.2">yesterday if the Fed raises the interest</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="3.99">rates two more times the yield curve</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="3.21">goes inverted we are in a recession the</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="4.55">whole thing starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="7.47">remember once one of the dominoes Falls</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s going to hit another Domino so if</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="3.72">something happens in the bond market</text>
  <text start="341.17" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s going to hit the stock market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="3.93">gonna hit the housing market it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="3.3">hit the derivative market and the whole</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="4.26">thing is going to be disaster what</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="3.39">happened in 2008 everything started to</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="2.97">fall apart</text>
  <text start="351.76" dur="4.08">the first domino fell and then all of a</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="3.87">sudden this company that company this</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="4.23">company the market felt they needed</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="3.84">bailouts everything just started to fall</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.26">apart you saw a huge amount of layoffs</text>
  <text start="361.9" dur="4.08">there are people in their homes that had</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="3.65">no jobs they couldn&amp;#39;t even turn on the</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="4.05">lights they didn&amp;#39;t have enough money</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="3.73">people were staying in their homes are</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="3.18">saying they weren&amp;#39;t leaving out in</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="3.81">California people were just walking out</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="4.07">of their homes because they didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="4.32">they left all their stuff in the homes</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s going to happen once again and</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="5.54">Russia and China they realize that this</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="6.54">was going to happen and it looks like</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="6.88">Putin is out there and he is saying that</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="6.24">it is now time where Russia is</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="6.21">completely independent from the petro</text>
  <text start="395.47" dur="4.68">dollar system stressing that the West is</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="3.81">boosting this process through its</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="4.92">economic bullying in the form of</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="5.67">sanctions this is not merely a</text>
  <text start="405.07" dur="5.07">separation from the dollar he says this</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="7.77">refers to the need of strengthening our</text>
  <text start="410.14" dur="8.31">economic sovereignty our gold yes he</text>
  <text start="415.72" dur="5">said it our gold and our foreign</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="4.77">currency reserves undergo</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="6.88">diversification and we will continue to</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="7.62">do it basically what he&amp;#39;s saying he sees</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="6.3">the writing on the wall he realizes the</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="7.98">Rothschild system the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="433.9" dur="8.1">Note is dead and it&amp;#39;s time that China</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="5.55">Russia completely separate themselves</text>
  <text start="442" dur="5.43">and they are no longer dependent on the</text>
  <text start="444.37" dur="4.62">dollar and of course he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="3.45">sanctions saying this is why we need to</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="3.84">do it the real reason is because the</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="3.81">entire system is just breaking down</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="4.489">because a lot of the sanctions are on</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="5.52">individuals in Russia and some</text>
  <text start="457.319" dur="5.261">corporations but this is not really</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="5.359">affecting Russia that much what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="5.73">affecting Russia is the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="465.569" dur="5.111">the petro dollar is affecting many many</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="6.079">nations around the world as it</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="6.209">continually declines as it dies and</text>
  <text start="474.389" dur="5.381">these countries they don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="4.53">down with the dollar so they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="479.77" dur="3.03">building their infrastructure they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="3.72">been building their gold reserves</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ve been building their exchanges</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="2.941">they&amp;#39;ve been building their markets</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;ve been building their bilateral</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="6.57">trades they&amp;#39;ve been building all of this</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="8.011">for a specific reason the reason is</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="6.269">because the entire system is falling</text>
  <text start="498.43" dur="5.31">apart it is breaking down and the whole</text>
  <text start="500.919" dur="5.21">thing is getting ready to go under this</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="5.729">is why they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and</text>
  <text start="506.129" dur="6.491">basically as we can see many countries</text>
  <text start="509.469" dur="6.3">are basically adapting and moving</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="6.27">towards the petro yujuan away from the</text>
  <text start="515.769" dur="5.851">petro dollar and the central banks they</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="5.819">realize this they understand that this</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="5.67">system can&amp;#39;t go on forever and this is</text>
  <text start="524.709" dur="4.5">why they&amp;#39;re getting ready and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="4.56">moving very quickly now to bring it down</text>
  <text start="529.209" dur="4.351">now again both sides want to control the</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="4.08">narrative this is the this is the game</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="4.279">here because whoever controls the</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="4.08">narrative and we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to tell the people</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.53">what has happened might not be the truth</text>
  <text start="542.709" dur="3.951">but they will tell them whatever they</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="5.039">need to tell them to convince them that</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="4.36">we need to go to a new system and of</text>
  <text start="549.579" dur="2.911">course it&amp;#39;s not gonna be because of the</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="2.91">central bank that they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="2.19">blamed for this they&amp;#39;re gonna blame this</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="3.12">on something else</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="4.44">if Trump in the Patriots get a hold of</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="4.02">the narrative they can turn around and</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="3.75">blame this on the central bank this is</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="5.28">what the central bank is trying to avoid</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="7.709">they do not want this to happen at all</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="6.419">costs so it looks like at this point the</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="4.771">central banks they&amp;#39;re gonna most likely</text>
  <text start="572.769" dur="4.801">going to raise rates until the system</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="5.76">starts to fall apart and this will allow</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="6.78">them to start to lower rates and use</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="5.26">other tactics and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="3.88">going to blame the entire</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="4.02">system falling apart most likely on</text>
  <text start="588.23" dur="4.53">Trump or maybe another country it looks</text>
  <text start="590.39" dur="3.87">like they might be blaming it on Iran</text>
  <text start="592.76" dur="3.89">we&amp;#39;ll get into that in a little bit in</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="4.769">the next report but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="596.65" dur="4.57">they are definitely pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="599.029" dur="5.31">and we&amp;#39;re going to be going through this</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="5.43">transition one way or another no matter</text>
  <text start="604.339" dur="7.141">who has the narrative there will be a</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="6.51">transition into a new currency how long</text>
  <text start="611.48" dur="3.6">will this transition bait we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="4.47">this is why you need to be prepared with</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="4.199">food water supplies you need to have</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="3.66">gold and silver remember this has been</text>
  <text start="619.279" dur="4.621">gold and silver have been money for</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="4.62">thousands and thousands of years they</text>
  <text start="623.9" dur="4.32">retain their value especially when paper</text>
  <text start="625.91" dur="7.02">currency dies a new currency system is</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="7.89">born they pretty much ensure your wealth</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="6.12">a lot of countries are looking at crypto</text>
  <text start="636.11" dur="5.43">currencies you should have some crypto</text>
  <text start="639.05" dur="3.42">currencies to use when the system comes</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="3.69">back online</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="4.14">you also need cash because in the</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="4.41">beginning stages of one the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.61" dur="5.64">coming down you will need this cash to</text>
  <text start="649.64" dur="4.53">purchase items as inflation hits and as</text>
  <text start="652.25" dur="4.41">things start to rise in price which</text>
  <text start="654.17" dur="4.77">means the value of that paper dollar is</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="5.7">decreasing they will become worthless</text>
  <text start="658.94" dur="6.54">just like in Argentina why more Germany</text>
  <text start="662.36" dur="5.52">in Venezuela and you&amp;#39;ll end up bartering</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="4.65">this is why you need supplies it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="3.959">just for you to survive by eating the</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="5.13">food and using the toilet paper and</text>
  <text start="671.839" dur="6.631">medicines it&amp;#39;s also to use to barter</text>
  <text start="675.26" dur="6.48">with individuals so let&amp;#39;s say you ran</text>
  <text start="678.47" dur="4.95">out of certain items maybe it&amp;#39;s food you</text>
  <text start="681.74" dur="3.93">might have extra rolls of toilet paper</text>
  <text start="683.42" dur="5.39">and you might be able to trade this for</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="6.35">the food when the system comes online</text>
  <text start="688.81" dur="5.98">you will use your gold and silver to</text>
  <text start="692.02" dur="5.62">establish your wealth you will use the</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="4.739">crypto currencies to most likely pay for</text>
  <text start="697.64" dur="5.67">things because at that point in time we</text>
  <text start="699.529" dur="5.721">will probably be on a crypto coin where</text>
  <text start="703.31" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re using it to transact business</text>
  <text start="705.25" dur="6.4">you&amp;#39;ll be able to use the gold and</text>
  <text start="707.36" dur="7.8">silver to purchase said coin and that</text>
  <text start="711.65" dur="5.309">means you have maintained your wealth by</text>
  <text start="715.16" dur="4.99">holding on to this and of course stocks</text>
  <text start="716.959" dur="4.781">bonds and other things if depending</text>
  <text start="720.15" dur="4.26">what company and depending what you have</text>
  <text start="721.74" dur="5.88">they might be worthless or they still</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="4.98">might be their land is always good land</text>
  <text start="727.62" dur="3.81">just doesn&amp;#39;t go away so that&amp;#39;s good but</text>
  <text start="729.39" dur="5.06">we can see that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="731.43" dur="5.4">certain period of time where we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="734.45" dur="4.21">struggle through this transition now</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="4.05">some people are gonna have a much harder</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="4.14">time than others because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="740.88" dur="3.75">really prepared for this they they</text>
  <text start="742.8" dur="3.3">believe that the economy was going to</text>
  <text start="744.63" dur="3.03">continue on the way it is their</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="3.75">lifestyle was going to continue on the</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="4.58">way it is and nothing was ever going to</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="4.23">change and of course when it hits</text>
  <text start="752.24" dur="4.39">everything&amp;#39;s going to change just like</text>
  <text start="754.08" dur="4.86">in the 70s a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="756.63" dur="4.2">realize what was going on a lot of</text>
  <text start="758.94" dur="5.43">people coming out of college that they</text>
  <text start="760.83" dur="6.99">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs in the 70s and they</text>
  <text start="764.37" dur="5.28">couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel for their car and it</text>
  <text start="767.82" dur="4.61">was very hard at that point in time</text>
  <text start="769.65" dur="5.28">credit kind of froze up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="772.43" dur="4.33">we had interest rates rising because</text>
  <text start="774.93" dur="5.16">they were printing a lot of dollars at</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="5.34">the time and you could see that there</text>
  <text start="780.09" dur="4.59">was a huge amount of inflation wages had</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="3.93">to be readjusted and everything was out</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="3.03">of whack because we were coming off a</text>
  <text start="786.03" dur="3.9">gold standard moving on to a petro</text>
  <text start="787.71" dur="5.67">dollar system that was a transition</text>
  <text start="789.93" dur="5.82">period but again back then we were the</text>
  <text start="793.38" dur="4.98">reserve currency of the world and we</text>
  <text start="795.75" dur="4.47">were moving from a stable system to an</text>
  <text start="798.36" dur="4.89">unstable system but it was the beginning</text>
  <text start="800.22" dur="6.39">stages so yes there was a period of a</text>
  <text start="803.25" dur="6.27">hiccup but this time it&amp;#39;s much worse we</text>
  <text start="806.61" dur="5.04">have trillions upon trillions of debt</text>
  <text start="809.52" dur="5.28">not just here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="811.65" dur="6.96">global debt we have derivatives that are</text>
  <text start="814.8" dur="6.81">just completely out of control and the</text>
  <text start="818.61" dur="7.29">dollar has lost basically almost all of</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="6.51">its value and we see right now that this</text>
  <text start="825.9" dur="4.08">is going to be much much worse because</text>
  <text start="828.12" dur="3.66">the United States will no longer be the</text>
  <text start="829.98" dur="3.15">reserve currencies so we&amp;#39;re not coming</text>
  <text start="831.78" dur="3.06">off the gold sending moving on to the</text>
  <text start="833.13" dur="3.9">petro dollar system we&amp;#39;re moving off the</text>
  <text start="834.84" dur="5.16">petro dollar system which has been</text>
  <text start="837.03" dur="7.11">basically destroyed moving to a</text>
  <text start="840" dur="6.93">completely new reserve currency whatever</text>
  <text start="844.14" dur="4.92">that might be and gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="3.69">reevaluated and it&amp;#39;s probably gonna be</text>
  <text start="849.06" dur="4.45">much much higher than it is today and</text>
  <text start="850.62" dur="5.11">this is why that will ensure your</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="4.74">self I mean look what happened when we</text>
  <text start="855.73" dur="4.74">came off the gold standard in 1971 what</text>
  <text start="858.25" dur="5.04">happened during that period well if we</text>
  <text start="860.47" dur="4.92">look back prior to 1971 if we look at</text>
  <text start="863.29" dur="4.44">1968 the gold price was around 43</text>
  <text start="865.39" dur="5.22">dollars an ounce if we look in 69 it was</text>
  <text start="867.73" dur="7.8">around 41 dollars an ounce in 1970 38</text>
  <text start="870.61" dur="11.36">dollars an ounce 1971 $44 an ounce 1972</text>
  <text start="875.53" dur="13.74">63 dollars an ounce 1973 106 1974 183</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="9.19">1975 139 go to 1979 459 and we can see</text>
  <text start="889.27" dur="5.4">yes it dropped a little bit and went</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="10.97">back up and if we look at 1996 it was at</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="10.32">396 and then all of a sudden around 19</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="6.79">2005 it went up to five hundred and</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="6.51">thirteen dollars an ounce 2008 869</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="5.85">dollars an ounce and it went all the way</text>
  <text start="911.5" dur="6.21">up in 2012 to sixteen hundred dollars an</text>
  <text start="914.77" dur="5.85">ounce and basically were around $1300 an</text>
  <text start="917.71" dur="5.58">ounce today so you can see as we came</text>
  <text start="920.62" dur="6">off the gold standard gold kept on</text>
  <text start="923.29" dur="5.61">moving up and up and up when we come off</text>
  <text start="926.62" dur="5.58">of this dollar that is completely dying</text>
  <text start="928.9" dur="6.27">dying and now the gold price has been</text>
  <text start="932.2" dur="5.88">completely manipulated what do you think</text>
  <text start="935.17" dur="5.19">the gold price is gonna go to once we</text>
  <text start="938.08" dur="4.11">move to a reserve currency so you can</text>
  <text start="940.36" dur="4.95">see the difference because the gold</text>
  <text start="942.19" dur="7.46">price from the 50s all the way up to</text>
  <text start="945.31" dur="8.1">1970 stayed around $35 and then it</text>
  <text start="949.65" dur="5.35">changed in 1968 this is when they</text>
  <text start="953.41" dur="3.9">started to print some money here and</text>
  <text start="955" dur="4.2">then it changed a little bit more in 71</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="6.24">72 and then boom it started to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="959.2" dur="7.92">so you can see we were at a level</text>
  <text start="963.55" dur="5.91">playing field at $35 an ounce and then</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="4.68">the central bankers they started to</text>
  <text start="969.46" dur="4.65">basically create a lot of currency which</text>
  <text start="971.8" dur="3.96">devalued the dollar and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="974.11" dur="3.66">we see gold start to move up we come off</text>
  <text start="975.76" dur="4.61">the gold standard and gold just shoots</text>
  <text start="977.77" dur="4.73">up so if you&amp;#39;re holding gold now at</text>
  <text start="980.37" dur="5.35">$1,300 an ounce even if you bought it at</text>
  <text start="982.5" dur="4.9">$1,600 an ounce let&amp;#39;s say you did and we</text>
  <text start="985.72" dur="4.55">come off the dollar today</text>
  <text start="987.4" dur="5.61">as the reserve currency it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="990.27" dur="6.33">gone and we moved to a new reserve</text>
  <text start="993.01" dur="7.62">currency do you really think the gold</text>
  <text start="996.6" dur="7.8">price is going to be thirteen hundred</text>
  <text start="1000.63" dur="7.77">sixteen hundred no it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1004.4" dur="6.13">adjusted and it&amp;#39;s gonna move up much</text>
  <text start="1008.4" dur="5.49">much higher because this has been</text>
  <text start="1010.53" dur="7.08">manipulated down because as the dollar</text>
  <text start="1013.89" dur="5.97">lost value the gold price really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1017.61" dur="4.83">move up that much actually it stayed</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="5.64">pretty even and it came down a little</text>
  <text start="1022.44" dur="6.45">bit because of manipulation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1025.5" dur="6.93">gonna see a huge change once everything</text>
  <text start="1028.89" dur="6.03">completely falls apart I mean we saw a</text>
  <text start="1032.43" dur="4.79">huge change when we moved from a gold</text>
  <text start="1034.92" dur="6.99">standard to the petrodollar standard and</text>
  <text start="1037.22" dur="8.43">back then they just let gold move up to</text>
  <text start="1041.91" dur="7.41">the new value of the dollar pricing and</text>
  <text start="1045.65" dur="6.37">now they&amp;#39;re gonna lose complete control</text>
  <text start="1049.32" dur="4.26">once everything crashes and these</text>
  <text start="1052.02" dur="3.96">countries that are holding gold like</text>
  <text start="1053.58" dur="5.46">China and Russia they already understand</text>
  <text start="1055.98" dur="6.51">this they already know that once this</text>
  <text start="1059.04" dur="5.6">system breaks down guess what the gold</text>
  <text start="1062.49" dur="5.01">that they purchased at eleven hundred</text>
  <text start="1064.64" dur="4.93">twelve hundred dollars an ounce sixteen</text>
  <text start="1067.5" dur="4.65">hundred dollars an ounce it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="4.94">be worth that it&amp;#39;s gonna be worth ten</text>
  <text start="1072.15" dur="4.32">times that and they understand that and</text>
  <text start="1074.51" dur="5.41">this is how they&amp;#39;re gonna build</text>
  <text start="1076.47" dur="3.99">confidence in their countries so get</text>
