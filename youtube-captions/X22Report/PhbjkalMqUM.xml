  <text start="75.41" dur="5.7">look at retail and what is happening in</text>
  <text start="78.8" dur="4.47">the retail market which gives us a nice</text>
  <text start="81.11" dur="3.66">picture of how people are actually</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="3.66">spending their money do they have any</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="5.52">money are they employed are they under</text>
  <text start="86.93" dur="7.35">underemployed and but we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="90.29" dur="6.66">of stores now coming in saying that</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="5.16">their sales have dropped quite a bit</text>

  <text start="99.44" dur="5.58">and noble best by radioshack JC Penney&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.11" dur="5.76">just a nightmare and we are seeing many</text>

  <text start="117.25" dur="5.64">in their revenue and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.26" dur="5.28">unlikely that they&amp;#39;ll see growth in 2014</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="7.239">and they&amp;#39;re attributing this to poor</text>
  <text start="125.54" dur="6.449">sales abercrombie and fitch they are</text>
  <text start="130.129" dur="5.22">saying that their profit fell thirty</text>
  <text start="131.989" dur="6.351">three percent error pastel forecasts</text>
  <text start="135.349" dur="6.441">another loss and sears holding is</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="7.81">reporting a second-quarter loss of 100</text>
  <text start="141.79" dur="6.669">9494 million so what is going on here if</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="6">the unemployment rate is going down and</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="6.48">the economy is doing better and housing</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="6.539">is booming why the problem I mean back</text>
  <text start="154.939" dur="6.061">in February retail stores told us that</text>
  <text start="158.689" dur="5.401">they were closing hundreds of stores and</text>
  <text start="161" dur="5.959">laying off hundreds of retail employees</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="7.97">but the news tells us something very</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="8.11">different now you know they talk about</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="6.97">unemployment in the US and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="6.57">saying that unemployment you know the</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="7.379">applications for unemployment aid rose</text>
  <text start="181.639" dur="6.511">to 336,000 and but they&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="186.409" dur="4.47">things are getting better even though</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re rising this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="190.879" dur="5.79">the drop in layoffs helps explain why</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="5.97">drop growth has increased this year I</text>
  <text start="196.669" dur="4.38">mean or is it that the manipulated</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="4.89">numbers make it easier for the</text>
  <text start="201.049" dur="5.25">percentage of unemployed go down I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.68">going to go with that one because we can</text>
  <text start="206.299" dur="7.141">tell by the information that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="6.81">receiving on retail on housing that</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="4.769">things are not going well because when</text>
  <text start="215.75" dur="4.409">people are employed and they have money</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="4.53">and they always know that money is</text>
  <text start="220.159" dur="6.381">coming in people go out and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="6.631">spend but we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite and</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="5.14">this article goes on to say many</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="5.399">economists for see growth accelerating</text>
  <text start="231.68" dur="6.479">in the second half of the year to an</text>
  <text start="234.769" dur="5.821">annual rate of roughly 2.5% they expect</text>
  <text start="238.159" dur="3.991">consumers spending to pick up as the</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="5.7">effects of the tax increases and</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="6.479">spending cuts diminish and in the same</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.349">time that all this is coming out they</text>
  <text start="248.629" dur="7.051">also you know report that household</text>
  <text start="250.639" dur="6.87">income below end of recession amount so</text>
  <text start="255.68" dur="5.91">this goes on to say that the average</text>
  <text start="257.509" dur="6.451">American household is earning less then</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="7.4">when the great recession ended four</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="9.259">years ago us median household income</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="5.899">once adjusted for inflation has fallen</text>
  <text start="273.219" dur="7.73">4.4</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="11.61">sent and what this says is that nearly</text>
  <text start="280.949" dur="9.47">every group is worse off than four years</text>
  <text start="286.499" dur="7.861">ago so let&amp;#39;s put the pieces together</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="6.58">people have less income coming in less</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="4.649">saved because they have these great</text>
  <text start="296.999" dur="3.66">full-time jobs now because these</text>
  <text start="299.009" dur="5.19">full-time jobs have turned into</text>
  <text start="300.659" dur="6.841">part-time jobs these full-time jobs have</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="5.49">turned into no job so we have a vast</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="5.52">majority of people who are working in</text>
  <text start="309.689" dur="7.98">you know the service sector field who</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="6.929">are underemployed who are who don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="4.86">jobs at all and this is why you see</text>
  <text start="319.949" dur="4.59">retail sales going down housing start in</text>
  <text start="322.529" dur="5.13">the drop mortgage applications starting</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="6.541">to plunge because nobody has work and</text>
  <text start="327.659" dur="6.241">we&amp;#39;re seeing a disconnect now between</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="6.78">the government numbers and the Gallup</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="6.81">poll numbers of employment now the BLS</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="5.76">is showing 7.4 but the Gallup poll</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="7.199">numbers are showing 8.9 percent</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="7.38">unemployment and if we go back to 1994</text>
  <text start="347.909" dur="5.22">and we use the calculation from that</text>
  <text start="351" dur="3.719">time instead of the manipulated one we</text>
  <text start="353.129" dur="3.63">see that the real unemployment is</text>
  <text start="354.719" dur="4.141">twenty-three percent and among use</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="6.231">people coming out of college it&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="7.829">forty-five to fifty percent so that</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="8.679">paints a picture of what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="366.689" dur="7.44">on now I&amp;#39;ve said this in the past and</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="6.24">the countries are definitely prepping</text>
  <text start="374.129" dur="5.34">for some type of war which is World War</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="3.06">three let&amp;#39;s just come out and say it</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="6.211">because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="380.969" dur="7.32">and we see that countries are having</text>
  <text start="385.68" dur="5.159">continuous drills they&amp;#39;re changing their</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="4.86">constitution just like Japan is changing</text>
  <text start="390.839" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s to become instead of a pacifist</text>
  <text start="393.149" dur="6.24">nation to someone who can declare war</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="5.49">and protect allies the US is rotating</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="7.64">people under the Philippines base out</text>
  <text start="401.909" dur="6.851">there to cover China we have the u.s.</text>
  <text start="407.029" dur="5.781">circling now</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="8.73">with many bases and this just came out</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="8.85">today a top US air force official says</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="9.69">that the u.s. is planning to station a</text>

  <text start="443.62" dur="7.5">as part of the pivot to Asia policy the</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="6.87">idea behind it is to ring China with us</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="6">and allied forces now why would they</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="8.04">want to do that well we&amp;#39;re blaming them</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="8.06">for cyber attacks on the country they</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="6.09">are hoarding China&amp;#39;s right now is</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="6.01">hoarding and collecting gold it looks</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="7.38">like China is going to be the next</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="6.93">reserve currency and this general goes</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="5.37">on to say that we&amp;#39;re going to build many</text>

  <text start="481.03" dur="5.99">Air Force&amp;#39;s increased presence there the</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="6.81">US Air Force has nine major bases in</text>

  <text start="538.6" dur="3.84">you take all that and you wrap it all</text>
  <text start="540.52" dur="4.35">together what do you have</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="3.84">you have something&amp;#39;s coming and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="3.15">not even talk about the Middle East</text>
  <text start="546.28" dur="5.91">right now because that&amp;#39;s a whole nother</text>
  <text start="548.02" dur="8.36">story which includes the entire war but</text>
  <text start="552.19" dur="10.94">we&amp;#39;ll get into that in a little bit now</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="9.4">us promised Iraq weapons to be used</text>
  <text start="563.13" dur="5.8">against Iran and they were going to</text>
  <text start="565.78" dur="5.73">supply terrorists in Iraq to use against</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="5.4">Iran when the war broke out and this</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="6.09">goes on to say when Iraq was occupied</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="5.88">the US declared its intent to crush</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="5.4">terrorists but we have information that</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="5.55">the former US ambassador held a meeting</text>
  <text start="583" dur="5.82">with terrorists said they were willing</text>
  <text start="585.76" dur="5.43">to supply weapons to militants under the</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="7.71">condition that those weapons were</text>
  <text start="591.19" dur="10.68">pointed toward Iran and these weapons to</text>
  <text start="596.53" dur="9.12">be used for fighting Iran when the US</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="6.45">government Israel France England all</text>
  <text start="605.65" dur="9.42">invade Syria and then of course move</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="9.63">into Iran because Iran has a a like a an</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="5.91">agreement with Syria if they go to war</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="5.88">Iran would be there to help them Russia</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="6.39">is also backing Iran and Syria same as</text>
  <text start="623.83" dur="7.32">China so you can see where the war is</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="9.39">going to break out and now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="631.15" dur="10.08">seeing is Russia and Syria invited the</text>
  <text start="636.76" dur="6.45">UN to come in and to inspect the area to</text>
  <text start="641.23" dur="4.62">show that they were not using chemical</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="5.67">weapons when the UN security council</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="8.43">council arrived just so happens at the</text>
  <text start="648.88" dur="10.67">same time there was a chemical weapon</text>
  <text start="654.28" dur="11.67">use that killed many people and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="10.09">France England Australia all came out</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re saying that yes the Syrian</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="5.85">government used chemical weapons on</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="2.469">their own people but then I we have to</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="4.599">go</text>
  <text start="675.649" dur="6.451">back why would they invite them in then</text>
  <text start="680.089" dur="5.071">use chemical weapons on their own people</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="6.12">it makes no sense more likely what</text>
  <text start="685.16" dur="5.489">happened was the paid mercenaries which</text>
  <text start="688.22" dur="6.419">is paid by the US government and the</text>

  <text start="985.669" dur="4.2">government has to go out and find</text>
  <text start="987.709" dur="3.57">additional revenue and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="989.869" dur="4.83">and we saw this during the revolution</text>
