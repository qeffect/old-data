  <text start="65.03" dur="6.36">is the last two times we saw this the</text>
  <text start="67.55" dur="5.64">economy was in a recession let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.39" dur="4.52">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.19" dur="5.88">news now as we can see the retail</text>
  <text start="75.91" dur="5.5">apocalypse is continuing it has not</text>
  <text start="79.07" dur="4.8">stopped and we saw it with Toys R Us and</text>
  <text start="81.41" dur="4.56">many of the smaller stores and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83.87" dur="5.88">starting to see that Sears well it is</text>
  <text start="85.97" dur="6.48">completely crashing right now one of the</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="5.85">individuals on the board has resigned we</text>
  <text start="92.45" dur="5.94">see Nordstrom is also having a problem</text>
  <text start="95.6" dur="4.71">they were trying to go private and it</text>
  <text start="98.39" dur="5.339">looks like that is not going to work out</text>
  <text start="100.31" dur="6.33">either and it looks like their shares</text>
  <text start="103.729" dur="5.25">are tumbling right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="106.64" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re gonna be having problems we also</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="4.771">have stores like Banton and many others</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="4.23">that are having problems and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.75" dur="5.299">seeing is this is right before the</text>
  <text start="116.18" dur="5.91">holiday season and we&amp;#39;re moving into the</text>
  <text start="119.049" dur="6.401">timeframe where this is where the stores</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="6.149">either make it or it breaks them and we</text>
  <text start="125.45" dur="4.77">saw after last holiday season many of</text>
  <text start="128.239" dur="6.111">the stores well they didn&amp;#39;t do so well</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="7.79">and they announced many many closures</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="5.77">during the period of time when</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="3.25">everything should be going very very</text>
  <text start="140.12" dur="4.5">well because it is the holiday season</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="5.46">now the department store industry is not</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="3.33">doing well at all I mean Dillard&amp;#39;s is</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="2.73">down negative two point eight percent</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="3.06">Macy&amp;#39;s down negative one point nine</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="3.509">percent raw stores down negative point</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="5.34">six percent JC Penney down negative</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="7.441">three percent and this is spreading very</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="6.18">very quickly and again after this</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.649">holiday season I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="5.25">many more stores closed a lot more</text>
  <text start="165.049" dur="4.861">layoffs because we need to understand</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="3.6">why this is happening now of course the</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="2.79">corporate media the government and</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="3.21">everyone else wants to make you believe</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="3.9">that everything is going to online but</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="4.29">when we look at the actual numbers of</text>
  <text start="176.6" dur="4.41">online remember retail is a trillion</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="3.48">dollar business and when the corporate</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="2.91">media is out there saying well ads the</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="3.18">Amazon effect and it&amp;#39;s taking over</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="3.36">everything and they say well they did</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="6.29">ten billion dollars worth</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="9.15">it&amp;#39;s tiny compared to a trillion-dollar</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="7.3">market plus online sales is only 10% of</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="5.04">all retail sales so everything can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="3.81">going to Amazon it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="4.68">whatsoever and many of these</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="4.83">corporations they have online they have</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="3.21">an online presence where they have an</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="3.45">online website you can get everything</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="3.78">actually you can get a lot more on their</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="4.23">website then you can get in the stores</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="4.05">plus they have an added benefit you</text>
  <text start="215.45" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t have to wait for delivery you can</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="5.01">order it drive right to the store and</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="5.19">pick it up and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="3.96">media they don&amp;#39;t really want to tell or</text>
  <text start="224.18" dur="3.3">the government or the Fed they really</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t want to tell you what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="3.3">going on I mean think about how many</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="3.03">people have lost their jobs how many</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="3.87">stores have been closing how many of</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="3.84">those people have lost their jobs what</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="5.61">they don&amp;#39;t want you to realize is that</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="5.67">people don&amp;#39;t have the funds they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="3.18">have the money they&amp;#39;re not making the</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="2.94">salaries they&amp;#39;re getting laid off</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="2.69">they&amp;#39;re getting lower paying jobs we</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="4.41">know wages are continually declining</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="5.23">this is the real problem think about</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="4.68">this and go back in time and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="4.379">mentioned this before but during the</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="5.31">height of the crisis of 2008 going into</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="6.391">2009 2010 the official unemployment</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="4.02">numbers was what 10 percent or so these</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="3.3">are the u3 numbers</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="4.41">ever since then unemployment has come</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="4.95">down now</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="6.93">since that time retail has been getting</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="7.53">worse and worse and worse remember they</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="6.84">can&amp;#39;t make people spend their money they</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="6.42">can make people or entice people to take</text>
  <text start="281.39" dur="5.01">out loans like for an automobile where</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="3.33">they can say hey listen 0% down you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="2.94">not using any money of your own because</text>
  <text start="287.66" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t have any any way to do is make</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="3.66">monthly payments and actually will even</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="4.08">defer the monthly payments for like a</text>
  <text start="293" dur="4.11">month or two and people you know jump on</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="3.72">to this and say ok let&amp;#39;s do this they</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="3.84">can do it with housing they can say hey</text>
  <text start="299" dur="3.69">listen no money down or we&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="4.56">very low interest rate or we&amp;#39;ll pay off</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="6.51">your student loans if you purchase a</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="6.21">home now this is borrowing this is not</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="4.469">spending you didn&amp;#39;t take anything out of</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="5.1">your account most of the stuff is</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="5.521">without money down retail is a little</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="3.48">different first of all if your credit</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="2.159">cards are maxed</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to use your own funds</text>
  <text start="321.349" dur="3.961">and if you don&amp;#39;t have these funds guess</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="3.96">what you&amp;#39;re not gonna make a purchase</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="4.47">and this is the first place that we see</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="3.66">a problem in the economy and this is the</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="3.509">first place that we looked we realized</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="3.66">it we understood it and we put the</text>
  <text start="333.289" dur="3.72">pieces together and realize that this</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.949">was just gonna get worse as time moves</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="4.861">along here now it&amp;#39;s going to spread it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="3.81">going to spread to the auto industry</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="5.13">which is already happening because we</text>
  <text start="343.759" dur="5.13">know how they calculate sales we know</text>
  <text start="347" dur="5.43">how they Channel stuff the lots and</text>
  <text start="348.889" dur="6.78">every time they place more cars on a lot</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="6.329">that&amp;#39;s counted as a sale it&amp;#39;s not when</text>
  <text start="355.669" dur="5.791">someone purchases a car we also know</text>
  <text start="358.759" dur="5.041">with housing that interest rates are at</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="5.519">their lowest they&amp;#39;ve ever been and they</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="4.5">can barely move homes remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="366.979" dur="2.97">the homes sold are from hedge funds</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="4.109">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="369.949" dur="4.77">the the everyday American persons</text>
  <text start="372.409" dur="4.681">sitting on the sidelines manufacturing</text>
  <text start="374.719" dur="3.721">that&amp;#39;s not going well either now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="4.049">very interesting is the Empire Fed</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="5.31">survey came out and it soared to its</text>
  <text start="381.139" dur="6.12">highest in eight years now remember this</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="7.229">is the survey this is not the hard data</text>
  <text start="387.259" dur="5.611">and when we look at the hard data what</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="6.211">do we see well we see something very</text>
  <text start="392.87" dur="8.13">interesting we see that well inventories</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="7.199">new orders they have plunged work hours</text>
  <text start="401" dur="5.039">have plunged which again makes no sense</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="3.84">when you look at the survey when you</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="7.081">look at the soft data the hard data is</text>
  <text start="408.229" dur="7.59">moving and going absolutely nowhere now</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re starting to see some recession red</text>
  <text start="415.819" dur="5.31">flags more indicators that are letting</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="5.369">us know that there is a definite problem</text>
  <text start="421.129" dur="5.28">in the economy now the last two times</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="4.891">the spread between the thirty-year and</text>
  <text start="426.409" dur="7.681">five-year Treasury bonds was below 90</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="8.159">bps the US economy entered a recession</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="6.359">and this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="436.969" dur="5.91">now this is probably nothing but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="440.449" dur="3.991">been seeing a lot and we&amp;#39;ve been you</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="4.47">know tracking a lot of these indicators</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="6.599">and they&amp;#39;re really all pointing to a</text>
  <text start="447.349" dur="6">major recession headed our way and we</text>
  <text start="451.039" dur="3.001">know already just from Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="1.951">coming outside</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="3.87">listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna see any type of</text>
  <text start="455.3" dur="5.97">crisis in our lifetime that was the</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="5.7">flare that was shot into the sky letting</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="4.14">us know that a recession is coming it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="3.15">almost like when Bernanke announced that</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re not forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="466.76" dur="5.37">recession anytime soon that was the</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="5.37">beginning of 2008 by the end of 2008 we</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="3.78">were entering a recession actually it</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="4.17">happened way before that but that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="5.13">the stock mark so it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="4.92">is Richard sillas and there have been</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="5.25">many other individuals that track this</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="6.45">they track patterns they track cycles</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="5.22">and he is a professor at the Stern</text>
  <text start="489.77" dur="5.16">School of Business co-author would</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="5.64">sidney homer of the Magisterial a</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="5.55">history of interest rates and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="5.49">studied past business cycles and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.48" dur="5.16">been looking at the crisis and saying</text>
  <text start="502.64" dur="5.31">listen we&amp;#39;ve studied these cycles we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="4.65">done enough analysis we&amp;#39;d love look back</text>
  <text start="507.95" dur="5.279">in history and right now they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="7.05">the probability of a repeat of what</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="5.611">happened back in 2008 around 70 to 80</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="3.87">percent chance that this is going to</text>
  <text start="518.84" dur="3.87">happen again and I&amp;#39;m gonna say this</text>
  <text start="521.21" dur="3.84">chance is much much higher because if</text>
  <text start="522.71" dur="3.6">you put in all the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.44">everything that the central bank has</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="4.17">done listen we&amp;#39;re living in an</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="3.42">illusionary</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="5.61">world right now where they have</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="4.56">convinced us that the economy is fine</text>
  <text start="536.09" dur="2.7">and everyone&amp;#39;s saying well how can they</text>
  <text start="537.47" dur="6.87">do this this is impossible</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="8.82">go back to 2006 2007 you were living in</text>
  <text start="544.34" dur="5.22">an illusionary world at that time what</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="6">do you mean by that the subprime</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="7.95">securities which rated triple-a we now</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="7.17">know that they weren&amp;#39;t most of the</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="6.09">individuals encapsulated in these</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="7.62">subprime securities they were defaulting</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="6.87">on their loans and everything started to</text>
  <text start="568.4" dur="4.32">spread but they pretended and they kept</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="5.88">the illusion alive they never admitted</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="7.2">it until the very end the same thing is</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="6.75">happening right now everyone today is</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="6.24">living in an illusionary world when they</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.16">pull the plug the truth is going to come</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="5.25">out just like the truth</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="5.25">when the plug was pulled back in 2008</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="5.22">and when the market comes down this is</text>
  <text start="593.51" dur="5.61">the last thing that they have left to</text>
  <text start="596.63" dur="5.37">convince everyone that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.12" dur="4.589">fine once the economy once the stock</text>
  <text start="602" dur="4.56">market comes down because the economy</text>
  <text start="603.709" dur="6.781">has already been coming down</text>
  <text start="606.56" dur="7.89">we&amp;#39;ve been watching everything decline</text>
  <text start="610.49" dur="7.8">over time the only thing they have left</text>
  <text start="614.45" dur="7.319">is the stock market if this fell by 50%</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="6.75">today where 40% or 30%</text>
  <text start="621.769" dur="6.211">guess what corporations would use this</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="7.169">as an excuse to lay off a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="6.63">people they would cut costs and we would</text>
  <text start="632.209" dur="4.231">be in a recession right now even though</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="5.039">they told us all the way up to this</text>
  <text start="636.44" dur="5.61">point that we are fine now their trick</text>
  <text start="639.649" dur="5.611">is is that they&amp;#39;ve been telling us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="7.289">fine and because of the stock market</text>
  <text start="645.26" dur="6.329">coming down that&amp;#39;s the indicator of the</text>
  <text start="649.339" dur="5.341">official recession no the recession has</text>
  <text start="651.589" dur="5.041">been happening all along the economy has</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="3.27">been deteriorating all along we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
