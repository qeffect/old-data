  <text start="38.36" dur="5.76">is made 31st 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="41.72" dur="5.49">episode is one world government moves</text>
  <text start="44.12" dur="7.14">forward EU planned new tax ID numbers</text>
  <text start="47.21" dur="6.54">for everyone let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="51.26" dur="5.46">collapse financial news now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="53.75" dur="4.62">lot of economic information coming out</text>
  <text start="56.72" dur="4.17">today the US government the central</text>
  <text start="58.37" dur="5.55">bankers they are doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="60.89" dur="4.349">possibly can to convince every single</text>
  <text start="63.92" dur="4.68">person in the US and around the world</text>
  <text start="65.239" dur="5.361">that hey everything is fine and we can</text>
  <text start="68.6" dur="4.769">see right now they&amp;#39;re manipulating data</text>
  <text start="70.6" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re massaging a lot of the</text>
  <text start="73.369" dur="6.841">information using propaganda to convince</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="7.47">everyone that each sector of the economy</text>
  <text start="80.21" dur="5.73">is doing absolutely fun but we see</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="5.159">things are starting to slip we see the</text>
  <text start="85.94" dur="5.76">real economic information it&amp;#39;s shining</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="4.47">through all the fake and phony</text>
  <text start="91.7" dur="3.39">information they&amp;#39;re trying to throw at</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="5.731">us and we know there&amp;#39;s two different</text>
  <text start="95.09" dur="7.349">types of consumer confidence measures</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="5.13">that is used one is Gallup which is the</text>
  <text start="102.439" dur="4.141">people where they go out to the people</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="5.58">they serve a the people and the people</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="4.829">are the deciding factor of you know are</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="3.6">they confident about the economy are</text>
  <text start="111.409" dur="4.081">they not confident about the economy</text>
  <text start="113.27" dur="7.139">then we have the conference board which</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="8.58">is a government paid program and they</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="5.581">are the ones that put out what the</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="3.78">consumer confidence is and this is what</text>
  <text start="125.99" dur="5.339">what this is the one that the government</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="6.66">uses and this has always been high it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.329" dur="5.91">always been up there and it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="6.539">been the opposite of the Gallup consumer</text>
  <text start="137.239" dur="5.611">confidence but strangely enough the</text>
  <text start="141.049" dur="5.19">conference board consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="6.3">measure which hovered around 95 for the</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="4.891">last six months we see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.15" dur="4.35">starting to drop it&amp;#39;s starting to move</text>
  <text start="151.13" dur="6.78">in the same direction as gallop it has</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="8.55">dropped to 92 92.6 now they thought it</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="6.21">was going to rise to 96.1 but everything</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="4.799">that we&amp;#39;re seeing in the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="4.83">harder and harder to explain what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.849" dur="3.991">going on and it seems a little</text>
  <text start="168.95" dur="3.48">ridiculous with all the retail shops</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="5.039">closing and everyone&amp;#39;s looking around on</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="4.68">okay something&amp;#39;s wrong here and people</text>
  <text start="175.879" dur="2.64">who are trying to sell their house is</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="3.269">saying okay my house has been on the</text>
  <text start="178.519" dur="3.871">market for eight months what is going on</text>
  <text start="180.379" dur="4.561">here and I lowered the price four times</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="4.83">already I put out my resume to get a job</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="5.219">in a I&amp;#39;m not getting any answer actually</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="5.64">I look and I see there&amp;#39;s no place to</text>
  <text start="190.159" dur="5.041">send my resume and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="4.709">that there&amp;#39;s no other alternative but to</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.64">say okay consumers are not that positive</text>
  <text start="197.569" dur="6.03">anymore we see those saying business</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="6.45">conditions are bad well that also</text>
  <text start="203.599" dur="6.17">increase from 18.2 to 21.6 and the</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="6.21">consumer outlook for the labor market</text>
  <text start="209.769" dur="5.921">it&amp;#39;s less favorable now because</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="5.04">everyone&amp;#39;s starting to become aware that</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="4.109">something is not right now the corporate</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="4.65">media was out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="6.601">listen everything is fine personal</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="6.389">spending is the most since august of</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="4.35">2009 and of course when this runs</text>
  <text start="229.579" dur="2.371">through the corporate media everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="3.63">saying oh everyone spending their money</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="5.009">retail is back on track everything is</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="5.37">fine but then we look closely at the</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="6.511">data and what do we say well this was</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="6.69">driven by the increase in energy</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="5.699">spending it is increased by three point</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="5.82">eight percent month on month I remember</text>
  <text start="249.169" dur="5.581">this number is included in the spending</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="5.089">statistics so they can use this to show</text>
  <text start="254.75" dur="4.889">everyone that spending is increasing</text>
  <text start="257.349" dur="5.021">well we know spending is not increasing</text>
  <text start="259.639" dur="4.321">because it shows up in retail and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="3.24">not talking about the government retail</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="3.87">numbers I&amp;#39;m talking about the actual</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="4.44">retail numbers that come from the CEOs</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.309">where all of a sudden they say yes in</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="6.21">our store sales have declined we are</text>
  <text start="273.139" dur="5.941">closing you know 10 20 30 stores letting</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="4.65">go these people that&amp;#39;s the real number</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="4.2">that other retail number that the</text>
  <text start="280.91" dur="5.569">government puts out that&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="5.759">that&amp;#39;s massage that&amp;#39;s the illusion and</text>
  <text start="286.479" dur="5.381">when we talk about retail numbers we</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="4.081">like to go right to the source and that</text>
  <text start="291.86" dur="4.47">is the company and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="293.12" dur="4.5">seeing is that in each one of these</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="4.8">stores sale</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="6.21">our declining now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.13" dur="6.33">trying to convince us that Americans</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="5.54">found around 70 billion more in</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="8.58">disposable income and this is why</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="9.13">spending is surging what so why did they</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="6.93">revised the number to make it look like</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="6.93">people are spending well the US</text>
  <text start="322.97" dur="6.24">government decided to revise how much</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="6.69">spending power Americans have and as</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="6">part of the report they did the</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="5.25">following estimates of wages and</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="4.89">salaries have been revised for October</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="4.98">through March the revision to the fourth</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="3.81">quarter wages and salaries reflected the</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="4.43">incorporation of the most recently</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="5.16">available BLS tabulation of</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="4.359">fourth-quarter wages and sellers for the</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="4.62">quarterly census of employment and wages</text>
  <text start="351.139" dur="5.421">the the revision occurred because</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="6.09">according to the DEA Americans were</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="5.32">richer over the past six months so</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="4.949">according to the US government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="5.759">telling everyone that yeah people just</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="5.851">found this money out of thin air which</text>
  <text start="367.639" dur="4.911">is odd because despite the dramatic</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="6.66">upward revision in personal income</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="8.41">personal spending remained unchanged hmm</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s kinda odd suggesting US consumers</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="3.709">were even less willing to go out and</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="5.459">part ways with their hard-earned money</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="6.78">now there&amp;#39;s an easy way to confirm all</text>
  <text start="387.949" dur="9.78">this because if we see retail spending</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="10.171">increase from CEOs of the various stores</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="10.861">we can say yes okay this number is true</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="9.04">if we see retail spending decrease we</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="3.06">know this was completely manipulated now</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="2.46">of course the government is going to</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="3.6">come out with their manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="4.89">to try to convince everyone that yes</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="6.69">spending is increasing but we can see</text>
  <text start="418.01" dur="6.18">right now they are manipulating they are</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="5.99">massaging they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="6.87">possibly can to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="5.77">people are out there spending they have</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="7.52">a lot more income they have a lot more</text>
  <text start="433.7" dur="9.86">money and all of this is just about</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="7.6">shifting decimal points moving commas</text>
  <text start="443.56" dur="5.8">recalculating to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="7.8">that everything is fine we see the</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="8.91">housing prices they beat expectation by</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="6.39">most in two years now case-shiller came</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="5.58">out and looked at their 20 cities and</text>
  <text start="460.37" dur="8.07">they&amp;#39;re saying yes we see a rise of 5.3</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="8.819">5.4 three percent we only expected 5.1</text>
  <text start="468.44" dur="7.86">six percent that&amp;#39;s incredible actually</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="6.831">if you take a wider view and we look at</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="8.22">the national home price index guess what</text>
  <text start="479.5" dur="8.13">it dropped so they&amp;#39;re looking at 20</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="6.899">cities if you look at the entire country</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.59">the prices are falling right now they</text>
  <text start="491.419" dur="5.601">won four five point three two percent</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="6.8">down to five point one five percent and</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="5.38">when you look at this you see prices</text>
  <text start="500.02" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;re not doing what everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re doing actually when I look</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="5.94">around I see that prices are</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.71">dramatically falling it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="4.949">and worse now if the housing market is</text>
  <text start="512.81" dur="4.349">so fantastic and people just gobbling up</text>
  <text start="515.089" dur="5.851">these houses and prices are rising like</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="6.391">crazy the government doesn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="4.11">step in banks don&amp;#39;t have to do anything</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="5.27">because people are out there taking out</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="7.289">mortgages because they want this home</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="5.53">but we don&amp;#39;t see this we don&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="532.339" dur="4.771">everyday American running out to</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="5.58">purchase these homes and we do have</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="4.92">proof of this because Wells Fargo it</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="4.5">reintroduced a three percent down</text>
  <text start="542.03" dur="6.84">mortgage on its own without going</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="7.08">through the FHA hmm very interesting now</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="6.18">why are they doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.51" dur="5.28">realizing the Millennials you know who</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="3.15">have that huge amount of debt of student</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="3.03">loan because the government convinced</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="3.33">them go to school he&amp;#39;ll get a great job</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="4.9">while they graduated school they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="6.909">find that great job they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="564.72" dur="7.38">job they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to get the</text>
  <text start="568.439" dur="6.721">home so the next generation is not</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="5.479">purchasing so they tried everything they</text>
  <text start="575.16" dur="7.349">tried saying okay three percent down</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="7.391">through FHA they tried 0% down with some</text>
  <text start="582.509" dur="4.95">builders Wells Fargo saying uh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="6.119">just gonna do it on our own just to try</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="7.161">to get these people who have no money no</text>
  <text start="591.089" dur="6.69">job living with their parents to</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="6.94">purchase a home but guess what it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="597.779" dur="6.451">going to work because people do not feel</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="5.1">confident in what they&amp;#39;re doing if you</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t feel confident and you&amp;#39;re drowning</text>
  <text start="606.66" dur="5.4">in debt you&amp;#39;re not going to make the</text>
  <text start="609.48" dur="5.49">move it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and we</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="4.44">see retail contracting actually a lot of</text>
  <text start="614.97" dur="4.44">these Millennials who are working</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="4.589">part-time are losing jobs they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="619.41" dur="3.63">even hold on to them I&amp;#39;ve heard people</text>
  <text start="621.089" dur="5.25">were their hours are even getting cut</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="6.269">back and during these summer months this</text>
  <text start="626.339" dur="7.531">is not a hot time for retail now the</text>
  <text start="629.309" dur="7.111">Dallas Fed tumbles this is the 17th</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="5.31">month in a row of contraction for the</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="7.519">Dallas Fed this is the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="7.529">survey now they were expecting a balance</text>
  <text start="643.939" dur="5.411">to negative eight which is still</text>
  <text start="646.709" dur="6.271">negative but it went from negative 13.9</text>
  <text start="649.35" dur="5.76">all the way down to negative 20.8 does</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="4.829">not look good the baltic dry index</text>
  <text start="655.11" dur="5.839">inched up around six points to 612</text>
  <text start="657.809" dur="6.57">holding steady which is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="660.949" dur="8.771">during this time of year in past years</text>
  <text start="664.379" dur="9">we&amp;#39;re at 1,100 1,200 1,400 now out in</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="6.979">the UK we see Brits are being sent</text>
  <text start="673.379" dur="5.661">postal ballots with a guide that</text>
  <text start="676.699" dur="5.88">strongly suggests they should vote for</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="7.149">Britain to remain in the European Union</text>
  <text start="682.579" dur="8.531">now when they received the instructions</text>
  <text start="686.189" dur="8.551">it seems that they had a hand and a</text>
  <text start="691.11" dur="7.18">pencil in the box of remain a member of</text>
  <text start="694.74" dur="5.68">the European Union which</text>
  <text start="698.29" dur="5.729">seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to suggest</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="6.81">something and the people out in Britain</text>
  <text start="704.019" dur="5.25">are saying wait a minute this should</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="3.719">have never been sent out it looks like</text>
  <text start="709.269" dur="4.111">you&amp;#39;re trying to convince people this is</text>
  <text start="710.949" dur="3.841">the right box to check and of course the</text>
  <text start="713.38" dur="3.569">officials are out there saying no no</text>
  <text start="714.79" dur="4.739">this has nothing to do with this this</text>
  <text start="716.949" dur="4.471">will not sway the people at all but you</text>

  <text start="721.42" dur="3.659">instructions they say this is the box to</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="5.459">check without reading anything over and</text>
  <text start="725.079" dur="8.521">they check this box it should have been</text>
  <text start="728.649" dur="7.951">an arrow pointing to both boxes that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="4.56">it but we know what they&amp;#39;re up to we</text>
  <text start="736.6" dur="3.03">know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they</text>
  <text start="738.16" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t want people thinking on their own</text>
  <text start="739.63" dur="5.34">they want people to follow their</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="6.569">instructions and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="5.94">the choice for them now something very</text>
  <text start="748.509" dur="4.26">interesting came up and it looks like</text>
  <text start="750.91" dur="5.22">the groundwork is being laid for</text>
  <text start="752.769" dur="6.151">everyone in Europe to be given a new tax</text>
  <text start="756.13" dur="4.8">ID number and it looks like this is in</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="5.609">preparation for a one-world government</text>
  <text start="760.93" dur="7.68">in preparation for moving to electronic</text>
  <text start="764.529" dur="7.92">money and under plans by Brussels every</text>
  <text start="768.61" dur="6.089">working person in the U is to be given a</text>
  <text start="772.449" dur="4.861">personal European taxpayer</text>
  <text start="774.699" dur="4.44">identification number and we see the EU</text>
  <text start="777.31" dur="4.44">Parliament Economic Affairs Committee is</text>
  <text start="779.139" dur="5.611">going to rubber-stamp a plan by</text>
  <text start="781.75" dur="7.139">commissioners to create a common</text>
  <text start="784.75" dur="5.67">corporates consolidated tax base what</text>
  <text start="788.889" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="790.42" dur="5.609">national insurance number pretense to</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="5.88">disguise the real objective and the</text>
  <text start="796.029" dur="4.11">scheme was passed by the economic and</text>
  <text start="798.31" dur="4.35">Monetary Affairs Committee last week and</text>
  <text start="800.139" dur="5.671">this is another step in the</text>
  <text start="802.66" dur="5.669">federalization of Europe and I hate to</text>
  <text start="805.81" dur="6.69">say this but the British will have to</text>
  <text start="808.329" dur="7.591">comply with this also now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="6.41">seeing right now is covert maneuvers by</text>
  <text start="815.92" dur="5.669">the EU to take over the member states to</text>
  <text start="818.91" dur="6.609">take over their corporate taxation</text>
  <text start="821.589" dur="6.81">powers with a common corporation tax</text>
  <text start="825.519" dur="5.241">base for Europe as a whole one world</text>
  <text start="828.399" dur="4.051">government does it sound familiar</text>
  <text start="830.76" dur="3.43">Brussels right now is</text>
  <text start="832.45" dur="5.61">eliminating independence within Europe</text>
  <text start="834.19" dur="5.88">on taxes and this enables Brussels to be</text>
  <text start="838.06" dur="6.66">handed the ability to track every EU</text>
  <text start="840.07" dur="10.11">taxpayer and it&amp;#39;s laying the groundwork</text>
  <text start="844.72" dur="8.63">for Europe to set up new taxes and we</text>
  <text start="850.18" dur="7.44">can see right now they&amp;#39;re slowly</text>
  <text start="853.35" dur="7.21">maneuvering and pushing this is how they</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="4.05">do it a little bit at a time a little</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="3.42">bit at a time and they tell you</text>
  <text start="861.67" dur="4.41">something else for the reasons why</text>
  <text start="863.98" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re doing it they never come out and</text>
  <text start="866.08" dur="3.78">tell you the real reasons and everyone</text>
  <text start="868.33" dur="3.06">says yes this is for the better this is</text>
  <text start="869.86" dur="3.87">this will be a lot better for everyone</text>
  <text start="871.39" dur="5.76">no it won&amp;#39;t will be a lot better for</text>
  <text start="873.73" dur="5.7">them not for the people now we talk a</text>
  <text start="877.15" dur="4.08">lot about Obamacare and we know this is</text>
  <text start="879.43" dur="5.64">not a benefit for the people we know</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="5.22">people are paying huge premiums to get</text>
  <text start="885.07" dur="3.87">the same insurance they have before</text>
  <text start="886.45" dur="6.21">actually insurance they had before was a</text>
  <text start="888.94" dur="6.81">lot better but back in September of 2013</text>
  <text start="892.66" dur="5.52">the IRS and the Treasury Department they</text>
  <text start="895.75" dur="4.76">issued guidance prohibiting businesses</text>
  <text start="898.18" dur="5.46">from using health reimbursement</text>
  <text start="900.51" dur="4.69">agreements which help workers pay for</text>
  <text start="903.64" dur="3.84">their health insurance plans purchased</text>
  <text start="905.2" dur="4.38">on the individual market and other</text>
  <text start="907.48" dur="4.65">medical expenses so companies cannot</text>
  <text start="909.58" dur="6.36">offer this anymore the only way that</text>
  <text start="912.13" dur="6.3">businesses can offer this is if they</text>
  <text start="915.94" dur="4.71">were to integrate the health</text>
  <text start="918.43" dur="4.59">reimbursement agreements with group</text>
  <text start="920.65" dur="5.55">plans then they can still offer the</text>
  <text start="923.02" dur="4.83">benefit now the Treasury Department said</text>
  <text start="926.2" dur="5.31">that you know these health reimbursement</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="6.87">agreements they didn&amp;#39;t satisfy different</text>
  <text start="931.51" dur="4.98">provisions and Obamacare so what choices</text>
  <text start="934.72" dur="5.58">do employers have today in these and</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="5.49">small companies well not many one they</text>
  <text start="940.3" dur="6.06">can either offer expensive group</text>
  <text start="941.98" dur="7.55">coverage which many times the small</text>
  <text start="946.36" dur="6.26">company they just can&amp;#39;t afford them or</text>
  <text start="949.53" dur="6.78">people are completely on their own and</text>
  <text start="952.62" dur="7.63">the employer cannot help the employee</text>
  <text start="956.31" dur="5.77">now any business that violates the rule</text>
  <text start="960.25" dur="4.46">is subject to fines of a hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="962.08" dur="4.11">per day per employee totaling three</text>
  <text start="964.71" dur="4.6">36,500</text>
  <text start="966.19" dur="7.29">in a year and businesses face a maximum</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="5.88">penalty of 500,000 per year so we can</text>
  <text start="973.48" dur="4.41">see what businesses are doing at this</text>
  <text start="975.19" dur="5.64">point they&amp;#39;re just letting people go off</text>
  <text start="977.89" dur="5.27">on their own and letting them pay for</text>
  <text start="980.83" dur="4.92">their own health insurance which means</text>
  <text start="983.16" dur="6.28">more money is coming out of their pocket</text>
  <text start="985.75" dur="5.49">so there was a point in time where</text>
  <text start="989.44" dur="4.56">companies would pay for the health</text>
  <text start="991.24" dur="4.86">insurance and now a lot of the small</text>
  <text start="994" dur="5.52">companies and I know many of them which</text>
  <text start="996.1" dur="5.97">I&amp;#39;ve spoken to saying this is what we</text>
  <text start="999.52" dur="5.28">have to do we can&amp;#39;t give them health</text>
  <text start="1002.07" dur="5.58">insurance they&amp;#39;re on their own they go</text>
  <text start="1004.8" dur="6.09">to the exchanges and they pay for their</text>
  <text start="1007.65" dur="5.25">own health insurance and we can see at</text>
  <text start="1010.89" dur="4.26">this point this is all about penalties</text>
  <text start="1012.9" dur="3.9">this is not about helping the people</text>
  <text start="1015.15" dur="5.73">this is not helping the companies</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="6.84">because a lot of times companies would</text>
  <text start="1020.88" dur="5.1">use the health insurance would use the</text>
  <text start="1023.64" dur="5.429">health reimbursement agreements to be a</text>
  <text start="1025.98" dur="5.04">little bit more competitive but at this</text>
  <text start="1029.069" dur="4.951">point it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1031.02" dur="6.66">make all companies be the same everyone</text>
  <text start="1034.02" dur="7.319">do the same thing and if these companies</text>
  <text start="1037.68" dur="6.269">don&amp;#39;t follow this system they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1041.339" dur="4.74">to be penalized and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="4.411">company saying okay I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="1046.079" dur="4.951">have over this number of employees I</text>
  <text start="1048.36" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t want them to work over this many</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="6.06">number of hours and we see this is not</text>
  <text start="1053.79" dur="5.13">helping the workforce this is actually</text>
  <text start="1057.09" dur="5.13">hurting the workforce which then</text>
  <text start="1058.92" dur="4.89">translates into not working out for the</text>
  <text start="1062.22" dur="6.12">economy because now the employee is</text>
  <text start="1063.81" dur="6.47">spending more money the businesses are</text>
  <text start="1068.34" dur="5.37">cutting hours the businesses are</text>
  <text start="1070.28" dur="5.2">reducing the number of employees and we</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="5.13">can see this is going to have a</text>
  <text start="1075.48" dur="6.57">dangerous effect on the economy as the</text>
  <text start="1078.84" dur="5.73">economy collapses listen everyone thanks</text>
  <text start="1082.05" dur="6.89">a lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
  <text start="1084.57" dur="4.37">especially be prepared thanks a lot</text>
