  <text start="88.13" dur="5.46">interview this week with Biggs we&amp;#39;re and</text>
  <text start="91.76" dur="4.08">we were discussing gold we were</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="4.86">discussing the economists we were</text>
  <text start="95.84" dur="4.86">discussing queue and we know that The</text>
  <text start="98.45" dur="6.059">Economist magazine back many many years</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="6.239">ago predicted that in 2018 we were going</text>
  <text start="104.509" dur="4.86">to see the gold standard or they just</text>
  <text start="106.939" dur="5.151">had a gold piece of gold there with the</text>
  <text start="109.369" dur="8.03">date 2018 on it and very interestingly</text>
  <text start="112.09" dur="7.36">during a Q&amp;amp;A session and Annan asked q</text>
  <text start="117.399" dur="4.51">are we gonna take down the federal we</text>
  <text start="119.45" dur="5.419">can&amp;#39;t get rid of the central banks and Q</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="6.831">responded that gold is going to destroy</text>
  <text start="124.869" dur="7.031">the Fed now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="128.74" dur="6.94">because right now we have the Economist</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="6.6">which predicted in 2018 that gold was</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="4.74">going to maybe be the new currency or</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="5.85">gold was going to be used in some way</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="7.02">and this was in the year 2018 and in</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="5.64">Annan asked you the same type of</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="5.16">question or a question about the Fed and</text>
  <text start="149.99" dur="6.51">Q responded that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="152.6" dur="8.31">destroy the Fed then we see Basel 3 and</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="6.819">within this new Basel 3 regulation gold</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="4.99">is going to be counted as</text>
  <text start="163.319" dur="5.04">money we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that in just</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="5.699">a minute but I wanted to head out to the</text>
  <text start="168.359" dur="5.94">UK and we understand that may is pushing</text>
  <text start="171.599" dur="4.5">her deal and Parliament the people there</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="4.8">continually rejecting it well we all</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="5.071">know that it&amp;#39;s an EU deal and we know</text>
  <text start="179.099" dur="3.931">that this is a central bank deal and</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.01">this is the way they want it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="5.819">gonna give on it so it looks like Mays</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="7.169">deal or I should say the --use deal was</text>
  <text start="188.849" dur="9.631">rejected again by an overwhelming 149</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="9.03">votes on March 12 Theresa May has penned</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="8.369">a public warning to MPs to back her</text>
  <text start="202.379" dur="7.681">twice rejected brexit deal or else we</text>
  <text start="206.849" dur="7.59">will not leave the EU for many months or</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="7.139">if ever she said if Parliament cannot</text>
  <text start="214.439" dur="5.73">agree to this deal before the European</text>
  <text start="217.199" dur="5.19">European Council on March 21st we will</text>
  <text start="220.169" dur="4.8">seek a short technical extension to pass</text>
  <text start="222.389" dur="5.07">the necessary legislation if it cannot</text>
  <text start="224.969" dur="6.751">we will not leave the EU for many months</text>
  <text start="227.459" dur="6.39">or if ever now this is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="5.12">central bank wants we&amp;#39;ve said this from</text>
  <text start="233.849" dur="5.66">the beginning we know what we would like</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="7.419">Trump has said we&amp;#39;d need a better deal</text>
  <text start="239.509" dur="7.57">the people want a separation of the UK</text>
  <text start="244.259" dur="6.63">from the EU they don&amp;#39;t like the deal</text>
  <text start="247.079" dur="7.77">that may is pushing at them because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.889" dur="6.78">really an EU deal and the EU doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="254.849" dur="6">want a budge what is their real plan</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="7.381">their real plan is to keep the UK in</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="8.281">limbo why because if they keep them in</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="7.29">limbo they don&amp;#39;t leave everything stays</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="8.06">the same and the central bankers this is</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="8.2">how they work let the government argue</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="6.74">about nothing</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="7.38">we&amp;#39;ll sit back and just keep everything</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="8.46">the way it is put everyone in government</text>
  <text start="287.92" dur="6.42">the people at each other and make sure</text>
  <text start="292.39" dur="3.9">they don&amp;#39;t look at the central bank</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="4.5">because we&amp;#39;re the ones who are causing</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="5.31">it what do you think happens in the</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="5.73">United States the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="6.39">state they keep the people fighting with</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="6.3">each other so we truly don&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="6.66">enemy and this is what is happening out</text>
  <text start="310.87" dur="6.12">in the UK and this is really their</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="5.64">agenda they they didn&amp;#39;t want to have a</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="5.97">deal with the UK they don&amp;#39;t want the UK</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="5.01">leaving and if they were going to accept</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="5.85">the EU deal guess what it was in their</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="6.66">favor but they knew that it was not</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="5.94">going to be accepted they knew that they</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="5.64">were going to be in this limbo state and</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;ve said this many many months ago and</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="4.95">here we are today where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="6.27">be in this limbo state unless the people</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="6.57">of the UK get together government gets</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="6.09">together and said says you know what</text>

  <text start="504.4" dur="4.23">started to spread across the country</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="4.95">this is what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to Canada</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s gonna happen to the world because</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="8.96">we are in an economic illusionary</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="6.69">economy created by the central banks and</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="5.32">right now</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="6.69">Trump&amp;#39;s mission is to bring down and</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="6.149">take over the central bank establishment</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="6.149">to get us out of this economy that works</text>
  <text start="531.459" dur="4.441">on debt now we know the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="534.339" dur="2.821">is gonna be meeting on March 19th</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="3.42">actually there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="4.14">happening on March 19th the Federal</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="3.24">Reserve meets and they&amp;#39;re gonna discuss</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="3.75">if we should raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="3.84">keep them steady I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="2.49">keep him steady actually there&amp;#39;s word</text>
  <text start="546.4" dur="3.15">now that</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="4.95">they might not even raise rates this</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="4.38">year some are saying maybe in the third</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="3.24">quarter which I think is gonna happen I</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="3.51">think it&amp;#39;s gonna happen I think most</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="4.5">likely they&amp;#39;ll just skip over it and</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="6.78">nothing will happen this year why Trump</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="5.969">is in control Patriots are in control so</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="5.059">what else is happening on March 19th we</text>
  <text start="566.199" dur="7.741">know that Q has this countdown going and</text>
  <text start="569.279" dur="8.05">t minus zero is March 19th we also know</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="6.87">that lawyers have to make a case in</text>
  <text start="577.329" dur="5.911">regards to Epstein&amp;#39;s sealed files that</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="4.23">they should remain sealed or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="4.17">going to be unsealed so we have three</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="3.359">things actually happening happening on</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="2.869">March 19th</text>
  <text start="588.399" dur="5.94">do I think this is a coincidence</text>
  <text start="590.279" dur="6.73">absolutely not but let&amp;#39;s go back to the</text>
  <text start="594.339" dur="5.851">question the an and ask you are we gonna</text>
  <text start="597.009" dur="7.38">get rid of the Fed and Q said well gold</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="6.87">is going to destroy the Fed and very</text>
  <text start="604.389" dur="5.31">interestingly we understand that central</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="4.829">banks they&amp;#39;ve been adding nearly 23</text>
  <text start="609.699" dur="5.161">million ounces of gold up 74 percent</text>
  <text start="611.889" dur="6.18">from 2017 and this is the highest annual</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="5.039">purchase rate increase since 1971 and</text>
  <text start="618.069" dur="6.33">the second highest rate in history</text>
  <text start="619.899" dur="8.731">Russia was the biggest player so on</text>
  <text start="624.399" dur="8.151">March 29th there&amp;#39;s going to be new bills</text>
  <text start="628.63" dur="7.56">this is Basel 3 they will go into effect</text>
  <text start="632.55" dur="7.51">those rules will allow physical gold</text>
  <text start="636.19" dur="7.74">bullion but not paper gold so physical</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="7.829">gold bullion not paper gold not GLD none</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="10.05">of the paper contracts to be on par with</text>
  <text start="647.889" dur="9">cash and sovereign debt instruments it</text>
  <text start="653.98" dur="4.979">may be no coincidence that as March 29th</text>
  <text start="656.889" dur="4.861">has been approaching banks around the</text>
  <text start="658.959" dur="6.24">world have been buying huge amounts of</text>

  <text start="672.459" dur="6.99">year almost twice as much as in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="675.55" dur="5.4">the highest level raised since 1971 when</text>

  <text start="692.29" dur="6.539">is the realization by major Italian</text>
  <text start="694.779" dur="7.021">newspaper Sol 24 or that synthetic gold</text>

  <text start="728.98" dur="3.96">been the normal order of things</text>
  <text start="730.269" dur="5.07">on the contrary gold closed last year</text>

  <text start="740.44" dur="3.81">bars behind the scenes they pushed and</text>
  <text start="742.57" dur="4.23">coordinated the offer of hundreds of</text>
  <text start="744.25" dur="5.25">tons of synthetic gold on the London and</text>
  <text start="746.8" dur="5.88">New York exchanges where 90% of the</text>
  <text start="749.5" dur="4.86">trading of metals takes place the excess</text>
  <text start="752.68" dur="3.75">supply of gold derivatives obviously</text>
  <text start="754.36" dur="4.08">served to knock down the price of gold</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="4.08">forcing investors to liquidate positions</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="5.1">to limit large losses accumulated on</text>
  <text start="760.51" dur="6.15">futures thus the more gold future prices</text>
  <text start="763.54" dur="5.549">fell the more investors sold synthetic</text>
  <text start="766.66" dur="4.47">gold triggering bearish spirals</text>
  <text start="769.089" dur="5.701">exploited by the central banks to buy</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="6.66">physical gold at ever low prices the</text>
  <text start="774.79" dur="4.56">only way government&amp;#39;s can manage the</text>
  <text start="777.79" dur="3.21">level of debt that threaten the</text>
  <text start="779.35" dur="4.89">financial survival of the Western world</text>
  <text start="781" dur="6.63">is to inflate or debase their currencies</text>
  <text start="784.24" dur="5.76">the ability to count gold as a reserve</text>
  <text start="787.63" dur="4.53">from which banks can create monetary</text>
  <text start="790" dur="3.899">inflation is not only to allow goal to</text>
  <text start="792.16" dur="4.38">become a reserve on the balance sheet of</text>
  <text start="793.899" dur="6.091">banks but to have a much much higher</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="6.84">gold price to build up equity in line</text>
  <text start="799.99" dur="7.23">with massive debt in the system so what</text>
  <text start="803.38" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that gold is</text>
  <text start="807.22" dur="6.33">being suppressed down so countries</text>
  <text start="809.92" dur="4.89">around the world accumulate as much gold</text>
  <text start="813.55" dur="5.42">as they possibly</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="6.99">ken and with basil three it says that</text>
  <text start="818.97" dur="4.15">physical gold not paper gold so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="5.34">why they were getting out of paper gold</text>
  <text start="823.12" dur="7.2">will be on par with cash and sovereign</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="6.84">debt instruments well think about it for</text>
  <text start="830.32" dur="5.82">a second what will bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="833.98" dur="5.16">what will bring down their private</text>
  <text start="836.14" dur="8.67">western central bank paper currency</text>
  <text start="839.14" dur="9.84">system physical gold not the paper junk</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="8.31">that they throw at us real gold as real</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="5.7">gold rises in price and remember right</text>
  <text start="853.12" dur="3.23">now it&amp;#39;s being suppressed so a lot of</text>
  <text start="854.68" dur="3.72">countries are taking advantage of this</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="6.19">purchasing a lot of gold because they</text>
  <text start="858.4" dur="7.71">know that gold is going to rise and once</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="5.31">gold starts to rise yes maybe the dollar</text>
  <text start="866.11" dur="6.45">will rise with it for a short period of</text>
  <text start="867.85" dur="8.01">time but as gold continually rises it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.56" dur="6.36">going to outshine no pun intended the</text>
  <text start="875.86" dur="6.65">debt note which is the dollar which is</text>
  <text start="878.92" dur="8.22">the euro which is all paper currencies</text>
  <text start="882.51" dur="8.97">gold will show the true value of the</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="9.72">central bank&amp;#39;s fiat currency system and</text>
  <text start="891.48" dur="7.93">when people realize that the paper notes</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="6.53">that they&amp;#39;re holding are absolutely</text>
  <text start="899.41" dur="8.16">worthless well guess what happens people</text>
  <text start="903.39" dur="7.93">want real money they want gold people</text>
  <text start="907.57" dur="7.14">then will pile into gold which will make</text>
  <text start="911.32" dur="7.17">gold price move up which will make the</text>
  <text start="914.71" dur="6.96">paper currency decline which then will</text>
  <text start="918.49" dur="3.63">destroy the private central bank think</text>
  <text start="921.67" dur="4.62">about it</text>
  <text start="922.12" dur="6.63">why are countries purchasing gold why</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="6.02">are states in the United States passing</text>
  <text start="928.75" dur="6.54">legislation so gold can be on par with</text>
  <text start="932.31" dur="5.529">fiat currency it can be used to pay for</text>
  <text start="935.29" dur="5.09">things outside of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="937.839" dur="2.541">System</text>
  <text start="940.66" dur="6.96">why is all of this happening remember</text>
  <text start="944.65" dur="6.42">each piece to the puzzle when you bring</text>
  <text start="947.62" dur="5.55">them all together you start to see the</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="4.71">bigger picture when you have all the</text>
  <text start="953.17" dur="4.56">puzzle pieces on the table and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.78" dur="3.93">all mixed up you see no picture when you</text>
  <text start="957.73" dur="5.61">start to put the pieces together a</text>
  <text start="959.71" dur="6.87">picture starts to form and we know that</text>
  <text start="963.34" dur="4.89">Russia China India Turkey many other</text>
  <text start="966.58" dur="3.45">countries they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot</text>
  <text start="968.23" dur="4.59">of gold we know there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="970.03" dur="6.03">manipulation in the market we see Basel</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="6.09">3 right now we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="976.06" dur="4.62">system is slowing and it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="978.91" dur="3.45">of tariffs it&amp;#39;s not because of what</text>
  <text start="980.68" dur="4.08">Trump is doing it&amp;#39;s because their</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="3.9">central bank system is collapsing it was</text>
  <text start="984.76" dur="3.51">going to happen no matter what they were</text>
  <text start="986.26" dur="3.45">just hoping to cover it all up when you</text>
  <text start="988.27" dur="3.86">start to start when you start to put all</text>
  <text start="989.71" dur="6.27">these pieces together you start to see</text>
  <text start="992.13" dur="5.38">the picture of what is happening and as</text>
  <text start="995.98" dur="4.17">we continually put more and more of</text>
  <text start="997.51" dur="4.98">these pieces together for this puzzle</text>
  <text start="1000.15" dur="4.47">the picture becomes clearer and clearer</text>
  <text start="1002.49" dur="4.25">and I think what&amp;#39;s happening is that</text>
  <text start="1004.62" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re setting everything up right now</text>
  <text start="1006.74" dur="4.63">the part of the plan is to set</text>
  <text start="1009.15" dur="5.4">everything up and put everything in</text>
  <text start="1011.37" dur="6.42">motion so when it&amp;#39;s time to make this</text>
