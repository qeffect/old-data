  <text start="176.34" dur="4.35">fine</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="5.16">behind the scenes in the shadows the</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="5.55">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="7.71">quickly and this is why I say that once</text>

  <text start="198.17" dur="7.93">at that point they won&amp;#39;t care and we can</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="3.69">see right now that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="4.14">be able to hold this economy together</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="5.28">much longer there will be some type of</text>
  <text start="210.24" dur="4.65">an event may be a financial event that</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="4.05">brings this whole thing down if not</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re going to see more and more people</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="4.56">being laid off because we know that this</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="4.62">holiday season it is not going to go</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.5">well they&amp;#39;re already predicting it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="5.58">going to go well and we&amp;#39;ll see by black</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="6.99">friday by cyber monday that this whole</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="6.06">thing is a complete disaster we see the</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="5.79">US services PMI for October printed at</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="5.88">54.8 this is the highest since 2015 of</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="3.84">November and we see that employment</text>
  <text start="240.99" dur="3.93">growth across the services and</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="7.44">manufacturing sectors remain one of the</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="7.56">weakest seen for over three years now we</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="8.31">are getting more signs that this economy</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="7.5">is approaching this depression I mean I</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="4.34">think we&amp;#39;re in a recession right now</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re approaching a depression right now</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="5.11">because when you take a quick glance of</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="5.28">the US auto sector right now everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="4.8">a Zulu auto sales are up look the bubble</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="3.78">has been pushed up and of course we know</text>
  <text start="272.4" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve been giving loans to subprime</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="5.22">people and all of that but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="5.13">seeing right now if you look past that</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="6.21">and you look beneath the surface we see</text>
  <text start="282" dur="6.45">that there are other problems and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="9.75">called auto repossessions and they are</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="12.12">soaring now when we look at 2008 and</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="11.579">2009 we see that repossessions were very</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="8.82">very high well today they&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="306.479" dur="8.011">the same levels</text>
  <text start="309.39" dur="7.35">and when we see this occur it means that</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="5.99">there are problems it&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="5.79">indicator letting us know that we are</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="5.17">headed towards this Great Depression</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="6.06">this collapse of the system when we look</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="6.03">at delinquencies and let&amp;#39;s say we look</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="5.82">at GM subprime securitisations where</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s 31 to 60 day delinquencies well</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;ve been on the rise since 2012 and</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="6.45">now stand at over eight percent of</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="5.34">outstanding loans ironically the levels</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="7.43">of delinquencies currently being</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="10.98">reported look very similar to 2001-2002</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="8.76">2008 to 2009 and the indicators that we</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="6.15">talked about yesterday they also</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="4.06">resemble what happened back in two</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.83">thousand eight and all the prior</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="7.59">recessions we see the year-over-year</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="6.15">change in 61 plus de delinquencies well</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="3.87">guess what they&amp;#39;re growing at</text>
  <text start="373.92" dur="8.64">double-digit rates for several months</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="8.04">now again another indicator I mean the</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.83">economy is just not just going to turn</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="6.51">around on a dime everything is</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="5.01">deteriorating very very quickly and each</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="4.92">one of these economic indicators that</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve looked at it shows this is what</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="4.5">happened in 2008 this is what happened</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="7.35">in 2001 this is what happens now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="7.47">in the same exact area so back then they</text>
  <text start="404.64" dur="7.71">called it a recession well if the</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="7.65">indicator is equal to or worse off what</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="5.28">do you call it now well they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="415.17" dur="4.11">it a recovery i&amp;#39;m calling it a recession</text>
  <text start="417.63" dur="4.14">i&amp;#39;m calling it that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="3.75">towards a depression now the corporate</text>
  <text start="421.77" dur="4.02">media is all out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.03" dur="6.12">saying wow us factory orders they&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="425.79" dur="6.78">looks like everything&amp;#39;s back on track</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="6.87">and when you really look at it you have</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="7.59">to remember factory orders they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="7.26">declining for 22 straight months 22</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="7.5">straight months during the great</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="8.85">recession it was something like 15 or so</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="6.69">and when they look and when we look at</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="7.73">these factory orders they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="10.35">there&amp;#39;s a rise of 0.6% this is a blip</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="7.27">compared to what we saw prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="7.86">where factory orders were between 10 and</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="10.34">20 where we saw back in 2010-2011 where</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="9.78">they are between 10 and 20 and now</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="7.63">they&amp;#39;re nowhere us factory new orders</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="6.06">are down seventeen percent from July</text>
  <text start="485.1" dur="7.59">2014 peak of the cycle and we are now in</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="7.11">a downward trend again another indicator</text>
  <text start="492.69" dur="5.55">and why did this happen in September</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="7.379">most likely they&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="6.81">the holiday seasons and will it last no</text>
  <text start="502.889" dur="3.931">I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to get really</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="4.41">I don&amp;#39;t think we should get excited</text>
  <text start="506.82" dur="4.5">about this little blip because I can see</text>
  <text start="509.46" dur="3.87">right now that it&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="5.07">completely fall off by the end of this</text>
  <text start="513.33" dur="7.1">year and come January it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="4.04">even worse remember what happened in</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="6.61">2015 when we came into 2016 the</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="6.6">beginning of the year was absolutely</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="6.27">awful well we went through an awful year</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="5.25">where everything was deteriorating come</text>
  <text start="534.33" dur="6.06">2017 it&amp;#39;s going to be even worse because</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;ve looked at maybe maybe at what 12</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="4.98">to 15 different economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re all telling us the same thing</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="4.11">the only thing the government and the</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="4.32">central bank have are the manipulated</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="5.16">unemployment numbers the suppression of</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="4.17">gold and the stock market that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything that</text>
  <text start="555.9" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re using the tells that</text>
  <text start="557.28" dur="8.37">everything is fine and we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="7.71">everything else and guess what if we go</text>
  <text start="565.65" dur="4.68">back to 2008 prior to two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="6.2">and we use all of these economic</text>
  <text start="570.33" dur="6.54">indicators they were predicting a</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="7.12">gigantic market crash and</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="6.99">2008 while the US government the central</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="7.68">bank hundreds of millions of people</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="8.21">believed that the economy was fine so</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="7.5">we&amp;#39;re doing the same thing right now and</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s predicting a bomb collapse a stock</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="5.01">market collapse it collapse of the</text>
  <text start="599.4" dur="6.05">system and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="601.86" dur="6.54">right now we see us productivity</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="6.04">continually declining and if we look</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="7.62">back in prior years for us productivity</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="9.99">we see that productivity was pretty darn</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="8.61">good from 95 all the way up to the Great</text>
  <text start="621.48" dur="6">Recession in 2008 we had some you know</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="7.52">little bumps and stuff along the way but</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="8">when we look at 2014 going forward</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="7.36">productivity has continually dropped and</text>
  <text start="635.48" dur="6.25">it&amp;#39;s continually declining and here we</text>
  <text start="639.51" dur="8.96">are a year on year in negative territory</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="10.22">and we haven&amp;#39;t seen this since 1993 and</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="5.44">we can see right now that from</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="5.41">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="7.38">from everything that we see this economy</text>
  <text start="657.36" dur="9.54">is getting ready to unravel this economy</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="7.62">is getting ready to come down hard and I</text>
  <text start="666.9" dur="3.27">do believe that once the elections are</text>
  <text start="668.91" dur="4.31">done they&amp;#39;re not even going to care</text>
  <text start="670.17" dur="6.48">anymore they&amp;#39;re just gonna let it go</text>
  <text start="673.22" dur="6.22">this has already been pre-planned they</text>
  <text start="676.65" dur="4.89">already know the economy is doomed they</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="5.399">already know that they can&amp;#39;t keep the</text>
  <text start="681.54" dur="7.46">system up I mean we&amp;#39;ve lost the edge in</text>
  <text start="684.839" dur="6.991">the Middle East the petro dollar is dead</text>
  <text start="689" dur="5.23">there&amp;#39;s a new currency on the way this</text>
  <text start="691.83" dur="7.4">is going to be a global currency we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="7.14">going to see massive dollar devaluations</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="4.69">where people are going to lose their</text>
  <text start="701.37" dur="5.04">pensions people are going to lose our</text>
  <text start="703.92" dur="4.589">life savings</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="6.479">and it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult for</text>
  <text start="708.509" dur="6.601">people to get by and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="712.889" dur="5.49">inflation because once the currency is</text>
  <text start="715.11" dur="8.039">devalued products are going to cost a</text>
  <text start="718.379" dur="9">lot more money and this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="723.149" dur="7.411">needs to have certain items to write out</text>
  <text start="727.379" dur="6">this storm because you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="730.56" dur="5.55">going to the store picking up bread if</text>
  <text start="733.379" dur="6.57">you can even find it for fifty sixty</text>
  <text start="736.11" dur="8.01">seventy dollars it&amp;#39;s just not possible</text>
  <text start="739.949" dur="6.781">and as things get worse it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="6.12">worse as time goes on until everything</text>
  <text start="746.73" dur="6.24">evens out so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="750.24" dur="3.99">this entire economy from all the</text>
  <text start="752.97" dur="4.14">economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
