  <text start="82.75" dur="3.57">things happening right now that are</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="4.619">absolutely crazy and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="86.32" dur="5.49">everything is intertwined at this time</text>
  <text start="89.259" dur="4.711">and the economy is not separate and</text>
  <text start="91.81" dur="4.58">apart from world events it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="93.97" dur="4.59">together and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>

  <text start="102.88" dur="5.489">the UK well retail sales they fell most</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="4.32">since 2011 and consumers right now</text>

  <text start="109.96" dur="5.4">from faster inflation now retail sales</text>
  <text start="113.83" dur="5.039">they dropped by point seven percent</text>
  <text start="115.36" dur="6.41">earlier this year and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="118.869" dur="6.36">right now is that this is continually</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="8.26">increasing where things are declining</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="7.171">and inflation is moving up in April what</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re seeing is food sales they declined</text>
  <text start="132.4" dur="5.16">by point two percent their first decline</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="5.25">since a period through August prices are</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="4.739">rising faster than wages in the UK and</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="4.379">shoppers are having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="142.299" dur="5.071">time this is going to start to happen</text>
  <text start="144.549" dur="4.591">around the world and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="3.27">that inflation is really going to take</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.59">hold and it&amp;#39;s really going to push</text>
  <text start="150.64" dur="4.68">everything where I should say the value</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="4.229">of the currency is going to drop and</text>
  <text start="155.32" dur="4.35">prices of goods are going to feel like</text>
  <text start="157.959" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re going through the roof we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="3.39">going to start out slow people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="3.571">going to really recognize it in the</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="5.1">beginning but as time goes on things are</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="5.76">going to rapidly change we see the labor</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="6.63">market right now well the rate of hiring</text>
  <text start="171.07" dur="6.33">right now well it is dropped it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="4.74">biggest drop in four years the BLS</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="4.44">reported that in February the number of</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="4.44">Americans higher dropped to 5.3</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="4.02">million sliding a hundred and ten</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="4.86">thousand or the biggest monthly drop</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="7.05">since April and we see right now that in</text>
  <text start="188.83" dur="6.93">February that hiring over the past year</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="5.639">it declined by three point six percent</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="4.71">relative to last year this was the</text>
  <text start="198.549" dur="4.621">biggest decline in the annual rate of</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="5.25">hiring in over four years and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="203.17" dur="5.7">looked at this before and we compared</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="5.76">hiring verse payroll and the last time</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="5.22">we saw this was back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="5.61">eight where all of a sudden we had a</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="6.27">slowdown in hiring and things started to</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="6.09">roll over and this happened back in 2007</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.77">going into 2008 we are now seeing it</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="4.47">last time we looked at this we saw it</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="4.98">happening where we reach the peak things</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="4.589">start to move over and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="6.86">roll over right now and we are declining</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="8.071">rapidly so the slowdown in hiring the</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="6.76">payroll which is also declining is all</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="5.91">happening at the same time and as this</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="5.729">happens the economy is going to implode</text>
  <text start="246.22" dur="5.849">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="249.459" dur="5.37">and this is going to have a ripple</text>
  <text start="252.069" dur="4.521">effect in many other parts of the</text>
  <text start="254.829" dur="4.141">economy because we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="5.049">retail stores completely closed and look</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="4.68">at hhgregg completely closed down look</text>
  <text start="261.639" dur="3.661">at JC Penney look at target look at</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="4.17">payless and many of the other source</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="5.369">it&amp;#39;s all contracting people are losing</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="5.31">jobs right now which means things are</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="5.661">rapidly changing we know that the</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="6.06">pension problem is a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="5.2">several as we know large public pensions</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="4.59">around the country they are in serious</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="5.52">trouble and after several years of</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="5.04">paying out more than taking in there</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to make it</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="6.51">now let&amp;#39;s look what happens if by some</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="5.699">small chance today&amp;#39;s market gets exposed</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="6.089">as a massive bubble and it all comes</text>
  <text start="297.789" dur="5.88">crashing down like in 2008 so what would</text>
  <text start="301.419" dur="5.191">happen if all of a sudden we have this</text>
  <text start="303.669" dur="6.451">huge correction well it would force the</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="6.869">funds to liquidate over 1.5 billion in</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="5.55">assets in 2018 alone and what will</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="5.611">happen then is that these funds</text>
  <text start="315.67" dur="6.33">they would run out of currency to pay</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="5.64">the individuals and as time went on</text>
  <text start="322" dur="5.64">within four years or less these funds</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="5.82">would have no currency to pay out</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="5.25">whatsoever and it would be completely</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="4.38">imploding on itself and this is</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="3.72">happening in many different states many</text>
  <text start="334.93" dur="3.27">different areas and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.96">continually happen because it&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="4.05">gigantic Ponzi scheme and if you really</text>
  <text start="340.57" dur="4.71">look at this we have problems all over</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="5.67">the place we have a retail contraction</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="6.3">problem we have a GDP problem I mean</text>
  <text start="347.92" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re forecasting this GDP barely over</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="4.71">zero present we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="5.16">with corporate defaults with</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="5.58">bankruptcies with loan creation the</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="5.04">stock market well that&amp;#39;s ready to</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="5.58">correct itself it&amp;#39;s ready to come down</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="6.36">so what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is a</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="5.37">disaster in the making and if we look at</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="4.2">the stock market we can see that the</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="5.67">stock market has hit all-time high and</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s a common saying that is used</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="6.36">with the stock market stocks go up the</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="5.28">stairs and then out the window well for</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="5.58">three months stocks have climbed the</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="5.46">stairs strange three months ago around</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="3.18">that time period there was the election</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.29">a little bit over three months I should</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="4.41">say and that&amp;#39;s when Trump was elected</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="3.69">and all of a sudden we saw this boom to</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="4.44">the stock market it&amp;#39;s been climbing the</text>
  <text start="400.09" dur="4.8">stairs ever since and now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.16">reached the window and are sitting on</text>
  <text start="404.89" dur="4.92">the edge and the entire market rally</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="3.99">since the election has been based on</text>
  <text start="409.81" dur="3.9">assumption that Trump administration</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="5.64">would be able to implement massive tax</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="6.6">and healthcare reforms this is not going</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="5.39">to happen the deep state central bankers</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re not going to let it happen and</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="5.92">none of these are going to happen</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="5.94">anytime soon or maybe at all and we know</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s been talking about jobs bringing</text>
  <text start="430.42" dur="5.82">them back and building manufacturing</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="6.33">this is not going to happen in this</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="7.26">economy it just can&amp;#39;t the system needs</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="6.48">to be completely dropped and brought</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="6.13">back online and this is what we see</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="6.31">happening right now and the market is</text>
  <text start="449.63" dur="5.01">beginning to wake up to this when it</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="5.34">finally gets it we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="454.64" dur="6.81">sharp and violent correction unfold the</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="5.52">fed already knows this they already know</text>
  <text start="461.45" dur="4.74">that this is going to happen remember</text>
  <text start="463.25" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been funding all of this they</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="3.6">push buttons and guess what they have</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.02">their own trading desk they&amp;#39;re pumping</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="5.1">free money into the banks the banks are</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="5.25">pumping that money into the market the</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="6.18">Fed is injecting the market on its own</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="5.88">directly they already know that this</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="4.92">system is getting too ready ready to</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="6.63">roll over this is why in the minutes</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="7.89">Janet Yellen said that the stimulative</text>
  <text start="489.89" dur="6.3">monetary policy is ending she says the</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="4.68">new focus will be on maintaining recent</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.01">economic gains there are no recent</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="7.05">economic games what she&amp;#39;s really talking</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="6.93">about is keeping this system up what</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="4.98">she&amp;#39;s saying is that whatever the</text>
  <text start="508.13" dur="5.099">economy is doing now that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.59" dur="4.68">going to be doing and she knows along</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="4.111">with all the other central bankers they</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="4.05">know if they&amp;#39;re not pumping this system</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="4.949">up and keeping it on life support it</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="5.58">comes crashing down and we can see that</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="4.771">it is coming to an end because they know</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="4.32">that it&amp;#39;s ready to roll over they know</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="5.07">they will not be able to stop it and</text>
  <text start="529.22" dur="6.45">this is why they&amp;#39;re taking their hands</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="7.4">off of it stepping back because they</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="6.84">want it to crash right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.53" dur="5.11">signaling with their interest rate hike</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="4.38">with saying that we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="4.29">pumping the funds into the stock market</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="5.61">anymore they&amp;#39;re going to let the economy</text>
