  <text start="102.35" dur="4.23">news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="3.509">housing market and how the housing</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="3.69">market isn&amp;#39;t doing well and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="108.289" dur="3.301">just here in the United States it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="4.26">many different countries and up in</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="5.52">Canada what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that just</text>
  <text start="114.53" dur="5.79">over 50 percent of Millennials age 30</text>
  <text start="117.11" dur="5.759">owned their own homes the latest census</text>
  <text start="120.32" dur="5.399">shows compared to 55 percent of baby</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="5.791">boomers at the same exact age and what</text>
  <text start="125.719" dur="5.911">is happening right now is that the cost</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="6.389">of these homes they are very very high</text>
  <text start="131.63" dur="6.27">because since 2011 the census shows the</text>
  <text start="135.049" dur="4.711">value of homes has steadily increased to</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="4.2">a national average of four hundred and</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="3.87">forty three thousand up from three</text>
  <text start="142.1" dur="3.06">hundred and forty five thousand so it</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="3.63">looks like it it&amp;#39;s gone up almost a</text>
  <text start="145.16" dur="4.889">hundred actually it has gone up a</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="4.65">hundred thousand dollars now Vancouver</text>
  <text start="150.049" dur="3.81">has had the highest prices in the</text>
  <text start="151.91" dur="3.84">country with the average home value over</text>
  <text start="153.859" dur="4.38">1 million Toronto is around seven</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="3.89">hundred and thirty-four thousand Calgary</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="3.601">around five hundred twenty seven</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="4.36">thousand and Montreal came in around</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="5.19">three hundred and sixty six thousand and</text>
  <text start="164" dur="5.489">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="5.07">census data shows that more people are</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="5.58">completely out of the market and they</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="5.49">are going to rent their homes instead of</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="6.361">purchasing their homes because these</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="5.97">bubbles have been blown up so high that</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="5.65">it&amp;#39;s completely out of reach to the</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="7.41">everyday first-time homebuyer or</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="7.02">even the existing home buyers and this</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="6.25">cannot be sustained because when incomes</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t you know keep pace with the home</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="6.11">values what happens is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="6.24">separation and we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="5.23">2007-2008 and eventually these bubbles</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="4.98">start to pop and we&amp;#39;ve shown many many</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="4.62">graphs of bubbles all over the place and</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="3.63">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the top</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="4.5">of the bubbles in many different areas</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="4.44">many different cities the bubble is</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="3.03">starting to pop and we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="3.33">that in a little bit but I wanted to</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="4.68">mention something that happened with</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="4.26">gold right now now Mexico announced it</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="3.6">would increase its foreign exchange</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="5.13">hedging program due to inflation fears</text>
  <text start="228.99" dur="4.59">and then all of a sudden and normally we</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.59">see the opposite happen where people</text>
  <text start="233.58" dur="5.04">will dump you know thousands upon</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="5.03">thousands of gold future contracts and</text>
  <text start="238.62" dur="6.24">bring the price of gold down this time</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="7">someone bought seventeen thousand gold</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="8.64">future contracts over 2 billion notional</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="7.02">driving the precious metals up not down</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="4.32">this time and that is very interesting</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="5.7">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.98">are starting to listen they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="3.72">to observe and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="3.81">realize that there is definitely</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="4.919">something wrong with the economy economy</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.559">and in all different countries we are</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="3.271">going to see inflation because the</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="2.941">United States sees inflation other</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="2.85">countries are going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="3.48">actually other countries are seeing</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="4.8">inflation but it&amp;#39;s going to get much</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="5.76">much worse here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="5.55">see that durable good orders they have</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.49">stagnated below 2007 highs for the last</text>
  <text start="286.14" dur="5.37">four years and thanks to a better than</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="5.04">expected 2.2 percent jump in September</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="4.49">the year-on-year gain was an impressive</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="5.25">sounding eight point three percent and</text>
  <text start="296" dur="6.01">we could see at this point that this has</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="5.31">been driven up by you know airplanes and</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="4.08">things like that and it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="6">being pushed up but when you look at it</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="5.85">over a period of time since 2011 durable</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="3.57">good orders they have really gone</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="5.039">nowhere whatsoever it&amp;#39;s pretty much a</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="6.439">flat line and it goes up it goes down</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="6.421">but nothing has really happened</text>
  <text start="320.449" dur="4.511">with durable goods it&amp;#39;s been holding</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="3.21">steady and this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="3.48">wanted to do they wanted bring it up</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="3.69">with airplane orders or whatever they</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="2.49">parts and things like that it comes back</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="2.339">down</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="3.57">they readjust the numbers they revise</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="5.551">the numbers they go back in time and</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="6.96">they continually do this now back to the</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="5.699">housing crisis here in the United States</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="4.519">we are seeing that there are many cities</text>
  <text start="343.889" dur="5.071">out there which case Euler looks at and</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="4.631">the Fed looks at this the corporate</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="3.42">media looks at this and says okay</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="4.14">the housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.47">moving up and up and up and that means</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="4.05">the housing market is strong and then if</text>
  <text start="356.85" dur="4.289">you look outside the 20 cities we see</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="4.89">that housing is really not that strong</text>
  <text start="361.139" dur="4.021">we see outside of the 20 cities well</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="3.57">there are individuals that are holding</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="4.11">onto their homes the value of the homes</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="4.02">are coming down it&amp;#39;s becoming harder and</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="3.36">harder to sell these homes and I think</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="4.8">what is happening just like it happened</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="8.159">back in 2008 is that we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="9.209">this housing crisis occur city by city</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="7.731">and New York is already beginning the</text>
  <text start="385.289" dur="7.051">process we also see out in California</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="5.47">San Francisco the Bay Area well it is</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="4.02">happening there and in other cities</text>

  <text start="401.88" dur="3.539">this is the third month in a row</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="4.351">year-over-year that this has declined</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="4.321">after having dropped around three point</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="4.35">five percent in August and two point six</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="4.709">percent in July and you need to keep in</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="5.4">mind the summer months are the most</text>
  <text start="414.449" dur="5.34">popular month for housing this is what</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="4.23">the Realtors wait for they wait for the</text>

  <text start="447.15" dur="4.73">indication of what actual sales might</text>
  <text start="449.849" dur="4.141">look like over the next few months and</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="4.42">right now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="5.04">look good out in the San Francisco area</text>

  <text start="503.55" dur="5.88">the way down to thirteen point four</text>
  <text start="505.919" dur="6.841">percent and this is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="6.45">disaster and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="6.569">is we&amp;#39;re seeing that the housing market</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="5.849">is coming down now think about it the</text>
  <text start="519.329" dur="4.83">interest rates are at the lowest point</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="5.911">ever I mean the only place we can really</text>
  <text start="524.159" dur="5.281">go is may be negative but we are so low</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="4.02">with interest rates and there&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="4.41">home construction companies saying</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="3.299">listen we just need buyers and what</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ll do is those people that have</text>
  <text start="534.959" dur="4.981">student loans will help pay student</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="4.589">loans off if they just purchase a home</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="4.83">and we can see that you know Fannie Mae</text>
  <text start="542.459" dur="5.971">Freddie Mac they&amp;#39;re gonna guarantee some</text>
  <text start="544.77" dur="6.629">of these loans and we can see that banks</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="6.24">now are giving 0% no money down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.399" dur="5.25">trying to do everything to get people in</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="3.44">to purchase home but the everyday</text>
  <text start="556.649" dur="4.471">American they&amp;#39;re on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;re not purchasing the foreign</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="5.07">investments it is drawing up right now</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="4.8">and the hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="4.92">well guess what they can&amp;#39;t continually</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="5.19">purchase these homes forever because</text>
  <text start="571.11" dur="5.13">once again they know there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="4.98">a top and they&amp;#39;ll need to sell these</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="4.62">homes and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="4.08">right now we are hitting the top in some</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="3.66">cities we&amp;#39;ve already hit the top and</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re coming down so we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="5.64">cascading effect city by city</text>
  <text start="587.699" dur="7.14">and it&amp;#39;s gonna start to fall and we saw</text>
  <text start="590.16" dur="6.959">this back in 2006 2007 2008 out in</text>
  <text start="594.839" dur="4.321">California people were leaving their</text>
  <text start="597.119" dur="3.69">homes because interest rates started to</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="3.619">move up they had adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="600.809" dur="5.07">mortgages they couldn&amp;#39;t afford them and</text>
  <text start="602.779" dur="6.97">everything started to fall apart we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.879" dur="7.49">seeing the same patterns they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.749" dur="7.74">repeating what happened back in 2008</text>
  <text start="613.369" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s like deja vu and this is going to</text>
  <text start="617.489" dur="5.7">spread to city to city to city and</text>
  <text start="620.689" dur="4.75">everything outside of those cities that</text>
  <text start="623.189" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re the bubble has been pumped up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.439" dur="4.8">just going to get worse a lot faster</text>
  <text start="627.689" dur="5.31">because remember outside of these cities</text>
  <text start="630.239" dur="5.22">things are already pretty darn bad where</text>
  <text start="632.999" dur="6.11">people can&amp;#39;t sell their homes prices are</text>
  <text start="635.459" dur="6.9">coming down traffic is drying up and as</text>
  <text start="639.109" dur="5.65">these Shiller cities start to plummet</text>
  <text start="642.359" dur="5.31">guess what it&amp;#39;s going to affect the</text>
  <text start="644.759" dur="5.37">outer areas and it&amp;#39;s going to hit each</text>
