  <text start="46.68" dur="4.979">United States Israel UK and other Arab</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="5.79">nations they&amp;#39;ve been funneling weapons</text>
  <text start="51.659" dur="5.61">into them supporting them and the</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="4.83">Islamic state is doing everything the</text>

  <text start="92.25" dur="6.689">plan which has been put forth to start</text>

  <text start="121.109" dur="4.86">dollar and this is going to pull this is</text>
  <text start="123.359" dur="4.44">going to be a very very big problem for</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.141">the central bankers because what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="4.141">to happen then other countries are going</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="3.48">to look at this and say okay if I can</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="3.93">buy all this oil from these countries</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="4.069">without using the US dollar why do I</text>

  <text start="149.33" dur="4.98">United States we will see the devaluing</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="5.61">of the dollar we will see prices start</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="6.42">to rise on different products and we</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="4.59">will see inflation and they right now</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="3">the central bankers United States</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="4.86">government are doing everything they</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="5.369">possibly can to provoke any country they</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="5.7">possibly can to start this war and</text>
  <text start="169.099" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re putting everything force to get</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="3.81">ready to go into Syria you can just see</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="3.601">how they&amp;#39;re planning plotting and</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="4.47">getting ready to go in there because</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="4.979">their goal has always been the same and</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="4.74">it seems like they are sticking to the</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="5.221">plan and they&amp;#39;re not going to be swayed</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="4.47">either way they&amp;#39;re going straight for it</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t care if Russia&amp;#39;s on the other</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="5.22">side they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing Russia if</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="5.07">this turns out to be an all-out war so</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="4.98">be it to them they really don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="5.55">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.71">news now what we see here in Japan it</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="3.629">looks like their economy is contracted</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="3.6">by seven point one percent in the second</text>
  <text start="207.109" dur="3.871">quarter this is the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.73" dur="4.47">third-largest economy and a contracted</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.44">and an annualized rate of about 7.1</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="3.42">percent and we can see they thought it</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="3.629">was going to be about six point eight</text>
  <text start="216.62" dur="4.35">percent but it was a lot worse than they</text>
  <text start="219.049" dur="4.641">thought and it seems like a lot of</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="5.43">countries are starting to feel the</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="4.96">economic pressures where their economies</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="3.36">aren&amp;#39;t doing as well as everybody</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="3.089">thought they were going to be doing</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="5.759">because you have to remember if we go</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="7.351">back one year now the European nations</text>
  <text start="235.519" dur="6">Japan everyone said we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="4.83">recovery we&amp;#39;re going to see jobs we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="4.761">going to see fantastic things happening</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="5.7">as we go into 2014 and it is completely</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.14">the opposite now it looks like France</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="4.08">they pretty much had it with their</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.439">president about eighty-five percent of</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="5.43">the population does not want the</text>
  <text start="255.859" dur="6.391">president to seek a second term in 2017</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="6.06">his approval rating has hit an all-time</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="5.49">low with just thirteen percent of those</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="4.289">as saying he is doing a good job now of</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="4.65">course you have to remember back when we</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="5.401">had the false flag event in August of</text>
  <text start="272.39" dur="4.86">2013 the president of France</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.28">out there the eurozone was out there in</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="5.64">the US was all hyping up recovery worm</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="5.82">recovery look everything&amp;#39;s going well</text>
  <text start="282.89" dur="5.91">and again the French people pretty much</text>
  <text start="285.98" dur="5.82">had it with the lies telling them how</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="5.49">great everything and basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="4.77">happening is the entire system is really</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="4.59">starting to fall apart and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="4.65">exactly what the leaders are telling us</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="4.32">and like I said it is always the</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="4.47">opposite of what they tell us if they</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="6.45">tell you we&amp;#39;re in a recovery thing</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="6.75">collapse now we can see that Argentina</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="4.65">now where they were going into default</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="3.6">and I said this in my past reports that</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="3.24">they might be looking at the BRIC</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="4.38">nations and they don&amp;#39;t really care that</text>
  <text start="317.54" dur="4.56">much about you know owing money to the</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="4.08">u.s. they don&amp;#39;t care about what the</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="5.88">judge says in the US and its starting</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="5.61">really to look that way where China and</text>
  <text start="327.98" dur="4.32">Argentina their central banks have</text>
  <text start="330.11" dur="4.74">agreed to a multi-billion dollar</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.61">currency swap operation to bolster</text>
  <text start="334.85" dur="5.13">Argentina&amp;#39;s phone reserves or pay for</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.92">Chinese imports with you one as</text>
  <text start="339.98" dur="6.15">Argentina&amp;#39;s us reserves dwindle in</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="4.95">addition Argentina claims China supports</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="3.93">the nation&amp;#39;s plan and the defaulted</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.5">bondholder dispute the swap will allow</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="4.8">Argentina to bolster its foreign</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="5.61">reserves or pay for Chinese imports with</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="5.67">you want currency at a time where a weak</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="4.44">export revenues and Allen currency have</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="4.56">put the Latin American nations farm</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="5.04">reserves under intense pressure so we</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="4.83">can see they are stepping away from the</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="6.66">western central banking system moving</text>
  <text start="369.92" dur="6">over to the BRIC nations China is</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="4.56">helping them they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="375.92" dur="4.59">bilateral deal and it&amp;#39;s exactly what we</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="5.22">thought it was going to be when we</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="5.4">reported on Argentina defaulting now I</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="4.92">talk a lot about the housing recovery</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="4.86">and it&amp;#39;s starting to look like this</text>
  <text start="388.73" dur="4.11">housing recovery is really starting to</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="3.78">fall apart I looked around the country</text>

  <text start="412.8" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re starting to lower their prices</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="6.06">even Fannie Mae just reported the number</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="6.599">of Americans who said now is a good time</text>

  <text start="437.039" dur="3.18">this year this is what Fannie Mae is</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="3.571">saying they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="440.219" dur="4.35">little bit of a pullback in 20 40 but</text>

  <text start="464.879" dur="6.09">us now we have to ask ourselves a couple</text>
  <text start="468" dur="5.339">of questions here why our mortgage</text>
  <text start="470.969" dur="5.07">applications to purchase a home down</text>
  <text start="473.339" dur="4.741">twelve percent versus one year ago well</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="6.151">let&amp;#39;s say the unemployment rate is down</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="6.44">a full percentage point why aren&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="496.889" dur="6.75">housing boom took hold how could home</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.31">prices rise by twenty-five percent since</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="4.56">2012 even though mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="5.88">have plunged I mean we know this because</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="5.431">we have we know the Fed we know foreign</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="5.64">investors are coming in and paying for</text>

  <text start="1025" dur="3.929">China is and right now the economies of</text>

  <text start="1042.01" dur="5.429">been using the same playbook in Nigeria</text>

  <text start="1049.63" dur="3.63">working in this area so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1051.49" dur="4.23">they switched it up and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1053.26" dur="4.68">this Ebola breakout and of course now</text>

  <text start="1060.46" dur="6.06">this region and you can see they are</text>
  <text start="1062.62" dur="6.419">definitely pushing the agenda and again</text>
  <text start="1066.52" dur="6.659">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that this isn&amp;#39;t real</text>
  <text start="1069.039" dur="6">and it is spreading and because what</text>
  <text start="1073.179" dur="3.151">we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that more and more</text>
  <text start="1075.039" dur="1.651">people again in fact it some people</text>
  <text start="1076.33" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1076.69" dur="4.29">and get infected and some people do but</text>
  <text start="1079.39" dur="4.11">it looks like since the borders are all</text>
  <text start="1080.98" dur="4.98">open and we&amp;#39;re flying people into the</text>
  <text start="1083.5" dur="4.17">states they want to really use the fear</text>

  <text start="1087.67" dur="4.14">send military down there we better help</text>
  <text start="1089.41" dur="4.38">out we better do something and it seems</text>
  <text start="1091.81" dur="4.05">like it&amp;#39;s playing right into this and</text>
  <text start="1093.79" dur="4.08">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1095.86" dur="3.54">and it seems like they&amp;#39;re going to take</text>
  <text start="1097.87" dur="3.12">control of each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="1099.4" dur="3.99">as we know they&amp;#39;re helping with the</text>

  <text start="1114.28" dur="4.92">to keep the nation&amp;#39;s contained have the</text>

  <text start="1128.41" dur="3.93">is in each one of these countries and</text>
  <text start="1130.33" dur="5.7">now the u.s. figured out a way of</text>

  <text start="1136.03" dur="5.07">in Japan they&amp;#39;re having problems moving</text>
  <text start="1138.58" dur="3.87">that US base to another area because it</text>
  <text start="1141.1" dur="4.2">will allow them to bring in more</text>

  <text start="1145.3" dur="4.26">it looks like the Japanese people are</text>

  <text start="2429.19" dur="4.8">have been reportedly conducted in the US</text>
  <text start="2431.38" dur="4.53">and UK dirty bombs are much easier to</text>
  <text start="2433.99" dur="4.2">make or acquire than conventional real</text>
  <text start="2435.91" dur="4.02">nuclear weapons and are therefore for</text>
  <text start="2438.19" dur="5.64">more plausible as a terrorist weapon and</text>
  <text start="2439.93" dur="8.13">also from the nuclear material you can</text>
  <text start="2443.83" dur="6.57">tell where it came from with a bioterror</text>
  <text start="2448.06" dur="4.02">you don&amp;#39;t know where it came from so</text>
  <text start="2450.4" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s most likely that they might use</text>
  <text start="2452.08" dur="4.47">some type of dirty bomb and they can</text>
  <text start="2454.63" dur="4.38">look at the isotopes and say yes we</text>
  <text start="2456.55" dur="5.61">found it it came from the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2459.01" dur="5.64">terrorists and these came from Iran and</text>
  <text start="2462.16" dur="3.45">they can pinpoint this over to the area</text>
  <text start="2464.65" dur="2.58">so you can see they are definitely</text>
  <text start="2465.61" dur="5.16">prepping for something like this to</text>
  <text start="2467.23" dur="7.08">happen and we already know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2470.77" dur="5.7">implicating Russia as using cyber</text>
  <text start="2474.31" dur="5.43">attacks against the power grid and the</text>

  <text start="2485.62" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re inside the United States and</text>
  <text start="2487.51" dur="5.7">they could take out the power grid with</text>

  <text start="2493.21" dur="5.78">all of this is starting to come together</text>
  <text start="2495.7" dur="5.82">right now we are heading down into</text>
  <text start="2498.99" dur="5.98">September then going into October where</text>

  <text start="2507.1" dur="5.58">and according to the wars Power Act he</text>
  <text start="2509.77" dur="4.74">has 60 days right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="2512.68" dur="4.05">that this will be coming to an end right</text>

  <text start="2516.73" dur="5.88">his amnesty executive order to after the</text>
  <text start="2520.81" dur="4.32">elections because the American people</text>
