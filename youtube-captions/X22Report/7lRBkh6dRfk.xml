  <text start="251.34" dur="7.679">at what is happening right now we can</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="7.35">see that Trump is showing the people of</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="7.351">the United States and the world that</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="9.15">this system can be controlled very very</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="7.65">easily and the Federal Reserve controls</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="7.2">this illusionary system its manipulated</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s not free and open and in the past</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.44">when the Fed was first brought in in</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="4.5">1913 they weren&amp;#39;t supposed to be</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="4.68">controlling interest rates they were</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="5.49">supposed to loan the government currency</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.95">with interest attached and they were</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.68">supposed to make sure there was no</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.55">inflation make sure the</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="6.959">we had full employment that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="6.81">much it but as time went on and the Fed</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="5.551">grew and we had the IMF we had the biz</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="4.079">we had other central banks and the</text>

  <text start="314.49" dur="6.75">fiat system they had control at all</text>
  <text start="318.259" dur="5.47">because otherwise their system would</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="5.64">crash and burn so they needed to</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="5.041">manipulate the system to make sure they</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="4.94">were able to keep the system going long</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="6.269">enough 2008 they had some problems and</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="5.62">they needed to take the next step and</text>
  <text start="335.039" dur="5.431">this is where we saw a stimulus this is</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="7.68">where we saw the Fed completely control</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="7.29">the entire economic system and before</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="6.45">Trump and the Patriots move forward with</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="8.159">the plan what do they need to do they</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="6.689">need to stop the government the corrupt</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="5.821">government that is continually spending</text>
  <text start="358.259" dur="6.03">that has these funds that go to nowhere</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="6.049">land and into the pockets of other</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="6.891">people and nothing is accounted for and</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="7.481">we&amp;#39;ve seen this happen many times before</text>

  <text start="443.51" dur="6.53">by coming all different programs by</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="7.71">cutting expenses needs to audit every</text>
  <text start="450.04" dur="6.94">part of the government because as we</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="5.91">know there are a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="456.98" dur="5.61">receiving funds that should never</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="6.36">receive funds and to move forward with</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="7.92">this transition - you need to cut</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="6.84">expenses because there will be no credit</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="4.65">card there will be oh you know what that</text>

  <text start="475.16" dur="5.22">let&amp;#39;s just borrow another trillion can</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="5.13">you imagine that think about your own</text>
  <text start="480.38" dur="5.099">household think about a business money</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="3.99">just disappears and you say I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.479" dur="5.131">worry about it we&amp;#39;ll just borrow some</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="5.22">more how long do you think that business</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="3.51">would stay in business or how long do</text>
  <text start="492.53" dur="4.56">you think your household would be able</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="5.88">to function eventually you wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="497.09" dur="3.96">able to this is what&amp;#39;s happening to the</text>
  <text start="500" dur="3.69">government right now what do you think</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="4.739">the interest rates around zero if the</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="3.63">interest rates actually moved up and</text>
  <text start="505.789" dur="3.481">forget about the rest of the economy</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="3.24">let&amp;#39;s just talk about the debt and the</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="3.81">government if the interest rates moved</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="4.8">up you think we&amp;#39;d be able to afford the</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="4.139">interest payments on the debt if it</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="4.89">moved up to three four five six seven or</text>
  <text start="517.219" dur="4.771">eight percent no the government would</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="2.88">not be able to the number of tax</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="4.2">receipts coming into the government</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="5.88">would not be enough at on top of that</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="6.269">all the different programs and all the</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="5.22">other spending there is it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="532.459" dur="3.091">impossibility this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.23" dur="3">continually lowering the rate and</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="3.27">lowering the rate this is one reason</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="4.02">there are many other reasons of course</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="4.85">which we talked about already but to</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="7.11">move forward the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="6.97">needs to reset quite a bit and this</text>
  <text start="548.36" dur="4.979">takes some time you need to audit you</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="6.24">need to find out where the waste is and</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="6.361">cut these programs or make them</text>
  <text start="556.88" dur="4.98">accountable and I do believe there is so</text>
  <text start="559.7" dur="3.23">much corruption in government that a lot</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="4">of these programs</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="7.43">nobody has any idea what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="7.18">this is why you need a business person</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="4.75">involved in all this not a politician</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="4.17">not a career politician who never ran a</text>
  <text start="575.11" dur="5.1">business who never had to account for</text>
  <text start="577.21" dur="6.63">funds you need someone in the private</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="6.48">sector who understands business who</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="4.65">understands profit and loss to take</text>
  <text start="586.69" dur="3.99">control actually this is why the</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="4.5">founding fathers really didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.67">career politicians they wanted people</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="5.94">who were who were in everyday life</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="6.52">running a business understanding a</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="4.26">business understanding the people what</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="3.81">they want because you&amp;#39;re an everyday</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="6.36">hardworking person they wanted them to</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="6.57">come in serve their time and then go</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="5.04">back to their business actually do you</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="4.68">know out of all the presidents that</text>
  <text start="614.59" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ve had there&amp;#39;s only three that did</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="7.14">not take a salary they decided instead</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="8.1">to donate their salary to charities who</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="7.5">are they John F Kennedy Herbert Hoover</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="6.87">and Donald Trump all the other</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="6.9">presidents no matter how wealthy they</text>
  <text start="634.69" dur="6.03">were they took a salary should tell you</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="5.64">something right there and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="5.46">interesting is that Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="644.11" dur="5.34">out there saying that we are getting</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="6.36">very close to a trade deal the first</text>
  <text start="649.45" dur="5.22">phase of a trade deal and China is out</text>
  <text start="652.54" dur="6.03">there saying that we&amp;#39;re really close to</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="6.93">striking a preliminary trade deal and he</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="7.62">said Trump said were in the final throes</text>
  <text start="661.6" dur="6.29">of negotiating an agreement Trump in the</text>
  <text start="666.19" dur="6.54">Patriots they&amp;#39;re setting the trap</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="7.96">they&amp;#39;re trapping the entire deep state</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="4.53">central bank&amp;#39;s system remember the</text>
  <text start="675.85" dur="3.84">argument that they&amp;#39;ve been pushing of</text>
  <text start="677.26" dur="5.64">why the global economy is declining it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.69" dur="5.46">because of these trade wars timing is</text>
  <text start="682.9" dur="4.59">everything you don&amp;#39;t want to do this too</text>
  <text start="685.15" dur="4.38">soon you want to make sure that everyone</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="3.87">is focused and understands that the</text>
  <text start="689.53" dur="3.57">central bank system and the Trump</text>
  <text start="691.36" dur="4.35">continually repeats this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="693.1" dur="5.13">understand the economy they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="4.26">understand trade they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="4.95">how it all works they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
