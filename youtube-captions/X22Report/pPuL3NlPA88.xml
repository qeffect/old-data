  <text start="57.32" dur="4.86">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.61" dur="6.449">episode 1704 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is October</text>
  <text start="62.18" dur="6.77">31st 2018 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.059" dur="6.181">is panic central bankers are trapped</text>
  <text start="68.95" dur="4.33">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.24" dur="4.29">financial news now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="4.68">interesting is that everything has</text>
  <text start="75.53" dur="4.92">flip-flopped since the beginning when</text>
  <text start="77.96" dur="5.519">Trump first came into office and while</text>
  <text start="80.45" dur="6.57">he was running for president and while</text>
  <text start="83.479" dur="6.871">he started his first presidency back in</text>
  <text start="87.02" dur="5.94">2016 the media was building a narrative</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="6.36">and I believe they thought they had this</text>
  <text start="92.96" dur="6.36">incredible power to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="5.49">Trump those people who are working with</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="6.57">Trump and people would just believe it</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="5.97">and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="4.619">strategy that the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="108.17" dur="4.86">deep state have been using well it is</text>
  <text start="110.509" dur="6.271">backfiring on them because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="113.03" dur="6.869">expect what was going to come next</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="5.729">because remember throughout this entire</text>
  <text start="119.899" dur="5.371">period of time they were always in</text>
  <text start="122.509" dur="3.301">control the central bank was always in</text>
  <text start="125.27" dur="3.629">control</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="6.36">and they never had an individual or a</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="6.361">bunch of individuals in office who would</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="5.55">fight back against them they never</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="3.05">experienced this never even knew what it</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="3.81">was like</text>
  <text start="138.31" dur="6.49">the central bank they knew what it was</text>
  <text start="141.53" dur="7.59">like but this is going way back in time</text>
  <text start="144.8" dur="7.29">before 1913 back to Andrew Jackson back</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="5.64">to the founding fathers and if we move</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="5.67">forward to the present day they really</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="5.04">hadn&amp;#39;t had anyone to really counter</text>
  <text start="157.76" dur="4.02">their arguments no one even mentioned</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.68">the Federal Reserve no one really</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="4.56">mentioned the IMF or the biz it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="4.29">much it stays out of the news no one</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="5.22">really realizes what&amp;#39;s going on even</text>
  <text start="168.77" dur="4.049">when we had the crash in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="171.56" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t mention that much about the</text>
  <text start="172.819" dur="3.571">Federal Reserve they pretty much blamed</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="3.63">it on the people well they should have</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="4.23">been taking out mortgages like they did</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="5.879">it&amp;#39;s all the people&amp;#39;s fault it was</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="7.12">speculators in the market everything was</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="6.521">fine everything was great the Federal</text>
  <text start="187.74" dur="5.76">Reserve their agenda was perfect nothing</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="4.47">was wrong remember the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.92">back then told us that we were not</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="6.99">heading into a recession during the year</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="7.28">we entered the recession and then they</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.97">gave currency to all the big banks and</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="4.96">then other currency went to other places</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="4.32">which were not allowed to know where</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="4.83">that went and they created a lot of</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="5.88">currency they stimulated the economy and</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="8.31">of course it was all for the betterment</text>
  <text start="218.64" dur="8.13">of the people was it really no because</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="5.04">we can see many years later things are</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="4.65">rapidly falling apart and they never</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="5.7">thought there&amp;#39;d be someone in office</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="5.01">today that would target the central bank</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.8">that would target the deep state that</text>
  <text start="236.43" dur="4.89">would target all these people and they</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="5.01">thought okay this person&amp;#39;s coming in no</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="5.13">problem we can handle it they never</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="4.89">expected Trump to contradict the Fed</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="6.57">they never expected Trump to contradict</text>
  <text start="249.24" dur="6.96">the news to contradict everything that</text>
  <text start="253.02" dur="5.279">they put out there from the very</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="5.94">beginning all the propaganda that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="6.841">been saying and now what is happening is</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="3.54">the economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="265.14" dur="5.78">quickly</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="7.89">Trump is pointing the finger at the Fed</text>
  <text start="270.92" dur="6.73">at what has been going on for a very</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="5.79">long time and placing the blame where it</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="5.16">should be placed and this is all being</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="6.54">done on purpose if we go to the level of</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="6.12">the everyday person we can see exactly</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="4.95">what is happening with the rates as the</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="3.06">rates move up things start to break down</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="4.08">I know the central bank right now</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re trying to explain away how rates</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t affect the economy at all</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="3.15">remember this is not a free market where</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="3.39">rates are allowed to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="299.76" dur="6.63">want the Fed is controlling it because</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="6.18">if they just let the free market go what</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="3.72">would happen everything went implode</text>
  <text start="308.19" dur="5.1">this is why they have to keep the rates</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="6.39">at zero or out in Europe in the negative</text>
  <text start="313.29" dur="5.55">territory but if we look at what is</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="4.8">happening with the everyday person and</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="3.18">we look what&amp;#39;s happening with automobile</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="2.929">dealer</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.17">ships like AutoNation for instance</text>
  <text start="324.229" dur="5.201">they&amp;#39;re one of the largest auto</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="5.939">retailers in the US with about 242 new</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="4.68">vehicle dealerships selling about 33</text>
  <text start="332.129" dur="5.07">blent brands including Toyota Lexus</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="6.63">Honda Acura and you know for GM Chrysler</text>
  <text start="337.199" dur="7.051">the rest and what they are seeing right</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="7.95">now is they&amp;#39;re seeing a drop in new car</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="6.75">sales and for many customers that are</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="4.14">visiting the dealerships they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="351" dur="4.169">first of all the prices of vehicles</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="4.679">that&amp;#39;s way too high with rising interest</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="4.351">rates it&amp;#39;s pushing them out of the</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="4.65">market and they they&amp;#39;re rejecting it now</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re saying I&amp;#39;m not doing this so</text>
  <text start="362.159" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re turning towards use vehicles now</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="3.019">people say well what&amp;#39;s the big deal</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="3.98">they&amp;#39;re going towards used vehicles</text>
  <text start="367.759" dur="5.741">remember this is going to affect</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="6.759">manufacturing and remember in the past</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="5.099">when Obama was president they used</text>
  <text start="376.949" dur="4.411">channel stuffing to make it look like</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="6.81">manufacturing was still okay here in the</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="7.559">United States what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="385.409" dur="6.451">that people are rejecting the economy</text>
  <text start="388.919" dur="5.821">they&amp;#39;re rejecting the rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="5.97">rejecting the high prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="5.519">rejecting everything about the economy</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="3.839">yes Trump is out there and this is part</text>
  <text start="400.259" dur="3.47">of the plan we need to remember this</text>
  <text start="401.669" dur="4.8">every time you hear jobs are better</text>
  <text start="403.729" dur="6.16">things are better this is all being done</text>
  <text start="406.469" dur="7.021">on purpose he had to create this</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="6.15">illusion and put it out there so the</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.07">mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="416.039" dur="3.93">central banks couldn&amp;#39;t use it against</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="3.3">him remember what I said in the</text>
  <text start="419.969" dur="4.621">beginning they never went up with</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="5.13">someone who would contradict everything</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="5.22">that they were saying now in the</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="4.56">beginning remember they were using the</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="4.229">idea that Trump is going to kill the</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="4.739">economy remember the central bank the</text>
  <text start="434.039" dur="3.901">deep saved me mainstream media it was</text>
  <text start="436.289" dur="3.78">planned they were gonna bring down the</text>
  <text start="437.94" dur="3.18">economy and whatever Trump does they</text>
  <text start="440.069" dur="3.69">were going to blame it on him they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="5.549">gonna wait say a year or so until he was</text>
  <text start="443.759" dur="4.951">really in there as president unless they</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="4.381">got rid of him somehow and then they</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="5.25">would start you know pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="3.75">at him well he turned things around they</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="3.989">didn&amp;#39;t expect this</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="5.339">and he started to contradict the fed at</text>
  <text start="457.949" dur="5.581">the same exact time they didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="5.821">that either and this confused them now</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="5.639">what do we do he has this economy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="6.269">doing really really well how do we blame</text>
  <text start="469.169" dur="4.921">him because if we start blaming him he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="3.69">going to bring up just like he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="5.96">doing if you&amp;#39;re looking at his tweets he</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="6.81">brings up the past he shows people what</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="5.38">really has been going on he shows them</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="4.981">the truth and we&amp;#39;ll be going into that a</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="6.06">little bit later in the next report but</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="9.42">what is happening here is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.49" dur="7.34">trying to counter what he sang and the</text>
  <text start="497.13" dur="5.34">fed right now former Fed officials</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="6.25">Yellen Bernanke Volcker you name it</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="505.08" dur="5.73">figure out a way to counter what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="6.27">doing now Yellen is out there she is</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="5.82">saying that the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="5.01">looking at the debt problem and the</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="5.459">United States is taking on too much debt</text>
  <text start="519" dur="6.3">right now whoa hold on a second</text>
  <text start="522.089" dur="6.571">all of a sudden the United States is</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="6.26">taking on too much debt now if we go</text>
  <text start="528.66" dur="4.65">back in time to what 1913 or so or</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.75">actually all the way back to George</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="5.46">Washington all the way up to 2008 the</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="7.32">United States put on 10 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="8.64">worth of debt from 2008 to 2016 during</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="8.88">Obama&amp;#39;s reign we added another 8</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="6.9">trillion within eight years so from</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="4.829">George Washington all the way up to</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="6.51">Obama we put around roughly nine to ten</text>
  <text start="557.339" dur="6.901">trillion dollars and then from 2008 up</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="5.4">to 2016 Obama within that short period</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="4.71">of time put eight trillion dollars worth</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="4.34">of debt onto the books of the United</text>
  <text start="568.95" dur="4.53">States where the people are responsible</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="5.71">now the Fed is saying that the United</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="4.53">States is taking on too much debt where</text>
  <text start="576.27" dur="4.23">were they during Obama where were they</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="4.68">before that mean because Trump is in</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="4.26">office and he put on another three</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="5.329">trillion all of us had now it&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="584.76" dur="6.29">debt we had too much debt</text>
  <text start="588.019" dur="4.341">already this is a fact and this is the</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="3.209">debt that&amp;#39;s being reported to us</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="2.979">unfunded liabilities and everything</text>
  <text start="594.259" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s like something like over 200</text>
  <text start="595.339" dur="6.69">trillion they&amp;#39;re saying it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="599.449" dur="5.401">sustained right now so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="602.029" dur="5.1">use the argument that Trump put on all</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="3.929">this debt and it cannot be sustained and</text>
  <text start="607.129" dur="4.14">the economy&amp;#39;s going to collapse because</text>
  <text start="608.779" dur="5.701">of it well we need to remember the feds</text>
  <text start="611.269" dur="6.44">entire business model revolves around</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="6.449">debt putting countries into debt and</text>
  <text start="617.709" dur="5.651">Trump didn&amp;#39;t add all this debt he only</text>
  <text start="620.929" dur="6.45">had a three trillion everybody else</text>
  <text start="623.36" dur="6.99">added eighteen trillion the difference</text>
  <text start="627.379" dur="4.531">this time is that the three trillion the</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="4.469">five trillion the tension that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="6.06">to be added is being put there on</text>

  <text start="637.97" dur="5.989">have the central bank raised the rates</text>
  <text start="640.689" dur="7.231">put the country further into debt</text>
  <text start="643.959" dur="8.531">contradict the Fed at the same time and</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="8.219">who is responsible because now you have</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="7.05">the ability to go back in time and show</text>
  <text start="656.139" dur="6.16">what the central bank has done to take</text>
  <text start="659.54" dur="5.13">it a step forward you can also say</text>
  <text start="662.299" dur="5.671">listen we didn&amp;#39;t even know we had this</text>
  <text start="664.67" dur="7.62">amount of debt once you start auditing</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="8.609">the Fed and then the blame is right on</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="7.62">the Fed the Fed is trapped there trying</text>
  <text start="676.579" dur="6.42">to figure a way out of this blaming</text>
  <text start="679.91" dur="4.44">Trump for his economic policies that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.999" dur="3.33">not going to work that&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="686.329" dur="5.401">trying to figure out a way to navigate</text>
  <text start="689.569" dur="5.671">around this they were never up against</text>
  <text start="691.73" dur="6.779">someone who would counter their</text>
  <text start="695.24" dur="5.759">arguments go back to the past and show</text>
  <text start="698.509" dur="5.01">them what they&amp;#39;ve done and as we move</text>
