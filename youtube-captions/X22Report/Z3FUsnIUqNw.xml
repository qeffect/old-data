  <text start="38.34" dur="5.85">7 2016 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="5.28">Russia is strategically maneuvering to</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="5.549">control the global oil supply to bypass</text>
  <text start="46.589" dur="5.731">the US dollar let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="49.739" dur="6.03">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="6.86">we&amp;#39;ve been hearing a lot about getting</text>
  <text start="55.769" dur="6.06">rid of cash we understand Europe Japan</text>
  <text start="59.18" dur="4.21">even the United States they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="61.829" dur="3.331">talking about going to negative interest</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="3.36">rates even though the central bank the</text>
  <text start="65.16" dur="4.62">Fed came out and raised the interest</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="4.83">rates by 25 basis points right after</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="3.839">that occurred we&amp;#39;ve been hearing</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="3.63">negative interest rates and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="3.39">hearing about a cashless society how</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="2.519">Larry Summers came out and said we</text>
  <text start="77.009" dur="2.731">should really get rid of the</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="3.721">hundred-dollar bill in Europe they said</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.71">they can get rid of the five hundred</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="7.169">dollar euro note and we see out in</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="7.14">Greece as soon as this was announced the</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="9.151">people in Greece got very nervous and</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="9.599">they took their 500 euro note and they</text>
  <text start="97.77" dur="5.16">deposit it back into the bank&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="6.451">they were nervous it was going to be</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="8.25">worthless and what&amp;#39;s on the drawing</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="7.83">board right now is that Greek banks they</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="7.92">might charge those people who want to</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="8.37">deposit the 500 euro note into the bank</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="8.339">a fee and this way help them prop up the</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="7.32">system a little bit help them pay down</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="7.02">certain things because they realize a</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="7.98">lot of Greek people withdrew their money</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="9">and we see at this point they have an</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="8.099">opportunity to tax the people now they</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="6.961">haven&amp;#39;t done it yet but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.239" dur="5.821">considering it and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="6.569">that situation very carefully now out in</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="8.819">Australia things are declining rapidly</text>
  <text start="156.989" dur="7.291">there we know that retail has been good</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="3.631">housing has been good the economy has</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="3.57">been good but everything&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="4.77">decline now just like we saw in Canada</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="5.16">Canada is a complete mess at this point</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="6.27">and it&amp;#39;s going down the tubes just like</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="6.33">every other country and retailers are</text>
  <text start="176.55" dur="5.79">already in Australia have been warned to</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="4.74">prepare for at least two years and every</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.05">time they say just to you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="7.17">going to be much much longer two years</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="7.44">of subdued sales growth as declining per</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="6.81">capita income&amp;#39;s softening housing prices</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="6.48">and weak commodity prices real retail</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="6.63">sales growth is expected to sell slowed</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="7.23">significantly in 2016 2017 leading into</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="7.379">2018 this is coming from Deloitte Access</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="6.66">Economics and they&amp;#39;re saying that what</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re seeing right now things are</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="4.2">going to really slow down now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.8">seeing this happen here in the United</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="5.339">States we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Canada we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="4.679">seeing it throughout Europe and it is</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="4.831">spreading right now because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.319" dur="4.441">happening is the unemployment rates are</text>
  <text start="228.57" dur="3.87">really going up people are losing their</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.49">jobs and the jobs that they are finding</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="5.88">their only part-time so what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="3.51">at this point is that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="3.509">don&amp;#39;t have discretionary funds they</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="4.11">can&amp;#39;t go out and pay for the goods and</text>
  <text start="241.829" dur="6.361">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this spread</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="8.66">throughout the world at this point now</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="8.789">here in the US consumer credit growth</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="10.21">we&amp;#39;ve revolving credit is way down</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="7.641">people are at their maximum and what</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they thought</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="9.01">credit was going to basically expand by</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="7.11">17 billion but it only grew by 10.5</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="6.15">billion the weakest and biggest myth</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="5.58">since march of 2013 and the biggest</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="5.28">driver of this disappointment was</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="7.62">contraction in revolving credit down 1.1</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="7.59">billion this shows us that people they</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="6.81">have nothing left here we&amp;#39;re running on</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="4.91">empty and as we move forward into this</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="2.54">year</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="2.85">more and more people are going to be</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="6.81">laid off we&amp;#39;re going to see more retail</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="7.92">stores closed as retail declines and the</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="3.87">situation is not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="4.05">actually it&amp;#39;s going to get much much</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="5.76">worse we&amp;#39;re seeing the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="9.21">is holding steady at 350 4 points right</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="9.96">now very very low this is absolutely in</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="5.82">a range where it&amp;#39;s completely awful now</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="5.7">Peter Schiff came out and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="5.58">discussing the economy and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="5.61">that the new bubble that we have right</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="8.88">now is much larger than the 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="7.859">and it is slowly leaking right now he</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="5.12">said the u.s. is already back in a</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="6.781">recession and socks are in a bear market</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="8.5">the bubble is now releasing air nerp is</text>
  <text start="351.26" dur="8.9">a complete disaster and as we move</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="8.01">forward we&amp;#39;re seeing that jobs are</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="5.08">absolutely non-existent ninety percent</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="3.479">of the jobs created were part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="5.07">eighty percent of the jobs were in low</text>
  <text start="366.979" dur="5.611">wage sectors hours worked on wages down</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="4.29">biggest drop in weekly earnings in US</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="3.3">history down point seven percent and</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="4.189">four point nine percent unemployment</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="6.54">rate means us creating low-paying</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="6.341">part-time jobs working-age people have</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="6.51">accepted bad jobs or have completely</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="6.45">left the labor force the real estate</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="6.15">bubble right now is getting ready to pop</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="6.03">and the economy is going to be heading</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="4.799">down the tubes and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="4.98">been seeing this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="399.889" dur="5.431">reporting on and as we move forward</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="4.94">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that everything is</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="6.08">coming together at this point all</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="6.73">sectors of the economy are breaking down</text>
  <text start="411.4" dur="5.47">nothing is improving the only thing that</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="4.35">is improving at this point is the</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="3.84">government creating illusionary</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="3.96">statistical numbers trying to convince</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="3.84">everyone that everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.44">keeping the market up and gold</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="4.799">suppressed because as of December of</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="6.84">2015 gold has gone up</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="6.68">200 plus points already and we can see</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="6.269">already the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="438.129" dur="7.87">Settlement has issued a warning to all</text>
  <text start="442.099" dur="8.011">central banks saying the negative</text>
  <text start="445.999" dur="6.211">interest rate risk is backfiring the</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="3.449">longer and more deeply central banks in</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="4.709">Europe and Japan venture into this</text>
  <text start="453.559" dur="6.03">unconventional monetary policy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.919" dur="8.131">going to get worse and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="459.589" dur="7.771">have major problems and of course as we</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="3.479">know the central banks are not going to</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="3.6">do anything about it because they need</text>
  <text start="468.529" dur="5.64">to stay on this path because if interest</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="5.97">rates rise if they stop the money</text>
  <text start="474.169" dur="4.56">printing if they stop everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="5.099">doing the entire system collapses and</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="8.581">they do not want to be blamed for any of</text>
  <text start="482.029" dur="8.341">this absolutely not and as we go on</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="5.969">throughout this year the central bank</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="8.19">the US government they need to prop this</text>
  <text start="493.279" dur="9.56">entire system up one way or another they</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="6.18">cannot let it collapse whatsoever</text>
  <text start="502.839" dur="4.3">because they want to bring it down</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="5.039">themselves they want everyone to look</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="6.601">over to there right at this other group</text>
  <text start="509.779" dur="6.211">at this other country and blame them now</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="5.579">Russia is doing something very</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="6.14">interesting they have played a</text>
  <text start="519.319" dur="7.08">masterstroke in the current oil crisis</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="7.149">by taking the lead and they&amp;#39;re forming a</text>
  <text start="526.399" dur="6.151">new cartel remember they had a meeting</text>
  <text start="529.279" dur="7.161">with Qatar Saudi Arabia Venezuela back</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="7.92">on februari 16th this was the first step</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="5.41">during the next meeting in this month</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re going to have another meeting in</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="7.469">March and they&amp;#39;re going to have a larger</text>
  <text start="544.819" dur="11.7">group of participants they are building</text>
  <text start="549.319" dur="11.7">a consensus to basically form this new</text>
  <text start="556.519" dur="6.331">oil cartel so they&amp;#39;re taking the OPEC</text>
  <text start="561.019" dur="3.69">nations</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="7.849">and they&amp;#39;re trying to create an</text>
  <text start="564.709" dur="8.63">anaerobic which is Russia and OPEC and</text>
  <text start="570.699" dur="7">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="573.339" dur="6.67">has been a longtime US ally but they</text>
  <text start="577.699" dur="6.301">might be looking at Russia saying hmmm</text>
  <text start="580.009" dur="8.161">maybe we should be moving towards what</text>
  <text start="584" dur="6.69">Russia is doing we see a rack is looking</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="7.83">at Russia and many other countries are</text>
  <text start="590.69" dur="7.139">also doing the same thing so if they can</text>
  <text start="596" dur="4.889">get this consensus of all these</text>
  <text start="597.829" dur="6.12">countries together Russia will emerge as</text>
  <text start="600.889" dur="5.281">the de facto leader of the major</text>
  <text start="603.949" dur="4.021">oil-producing nations of the world</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="5.089">accounting for almost seventy three</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="6.599">percent of the global oil supply and</text>
  <text start="611.259" dur="5.26">what they&amp;#39;re going to do once they</text>
  <text start="614.569" dur="4.921">capture the oil market they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="616.519" dur="6">to control it and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="619.49" dur="7.409">bypass the dollar though they won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="622.519" dur="8.01">need the petro dollar and what does this</text>
  <text start="626.899" dur="5.88">mean this means if the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="630.529" dur="5.67">countries who are selling their oil</text>
  <text start="632.779" dur="7.61">using the petro dollar when they stop</text>
  <text start="636.199" dur="8.101">doing this a lot of them have these</text>
  <text start="640.389" dur="6.851">dollars will float back to the US</text>
  <text start="644.3" dur="6.51">because countries will not need to keep</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="4.86">dollars in their reserves and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="3.06">where we&amp;#39;re going to get hyper inflation</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="5.669">because as more dollars come back to the</text>
  <text start="653.87" dur="7.38">US there&amp;#39;s more in circulation which D</text>
  <text start="657.769" dur="7.62">values the dollar and the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="9.959">is basically what&amp;#39;s propping this whole</text>
  <text start="665.389" dur="8.281">system up and Russia might say ok we can</text>
  <text start="671.209" dur="7.8">use the one we can use the ruble or just</text>
  <text start="673.67" dur="9.87">use your own currency and this is going</text>
  <text start="679.009" dur="7.861">to be a reality sooner than later now we</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="6.75">know the US government right now is and</text>
  <text start="686.87" dur="7.01">the central bank is not going to let</text>
  <text start="690.29" dur="5.849">this happen because if it does happen</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="2.92">everyone&amp;#39;s going to tour turn towards</text>
  <text start="696.139" dur="2.64">them</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="4.68">and say wait a minute you just destroyed</text>
  <text start="698.779" dur="5.341">the economy we&amp;#39;re blaming you the</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="5.46">economy is weak we&amp;#39;re in a recession the</text>
  <text start="704.12" dur="6.42">entire system just collapsed this is all</text>
  <text start="706.94" dur="6.72">your fault because back in 1971 we came</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="4.64">off the gold standard and you said we</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="3.69">should be on the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="5.17">well they didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone they just</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="9.2">did it and we see this was the central</text>
  <text start="720.35" dur="10.32">bank using the excuse back in the 70s of</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="5.65">gold speculators and I don&amp;#39;t remember if</text>
  <text start="730.67" dur="3.06">I don&amp;#39;t know if people remember this but</text>
  <text start="732.2" dur="3.66">they told us there was an oil shortage</text>
  <text start="733.73" dur="4.77">while they&amp;#39;re making the transition and</text>
  <text start="735.86" dur="4.56">it was very difficult to get that oil at</text>
  <text start="738.5" dur="4.709">that time I mean gas for the car I</text>
  <text start="740.42" dur="4.53">should say and at that point you had odd</text>
  <text start="743.209" dur="3.301">and even days which was the last digit</text>
  <text start="744.95" dur="3.93">of your license plate or you had red and</text>
  <text start="746.51" dur="5.4">green flags of those gas stations that</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="8.82">had fuel and there were long lines all</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="6.9">of that was a complete lie and people</text>
  <text start="757.7" dur="3.27">are going to turn and say you know</text>
  <text start="758.81" dur="8.51">something you put us in this position</text>
