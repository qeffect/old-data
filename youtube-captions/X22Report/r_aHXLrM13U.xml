  <text start="188.54" dur="6.6">lot that don&amp;#39;t and then we head into the</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="5.699">90s and 2000 and everything starts to</text>
  <text start="195.14" dur="4.62">fall apart people don&amp;#39;t notice it yet</text>
  <text start="197.569" dur="5.371">people continue to do what they&amp;#39;re been</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="6.03">doing the Fed continually creates</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="7.98">bubbles every seven or eight years or so</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="8.88">and people go ahead and they take out</text>
  <text start="210.92" dur="6.41">loans they take out mortgages with the</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="5.31">cars you started off with paying cash</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="5.32">then you went into financing and they</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.74">extended the terms for financing then</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="4.98">they went ahead and they said financing</text>
  <text start="224.72" dur="5.549">well the cost of the car is way too high</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="4.169">you might have to lease it now and of</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="3.211">course they started off with two years</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="3.621">three years they went to four or five</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="6.75">and you to put a down payment on it and</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="8.649">this continued on and wages they really</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="6.15">didn&amp;#39;t move anywhere this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.069" dur="4.801">looking at right now this is the the</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="5.009">timeline of a central bank system now</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;re at the end stage and what do we</text>
  <text start="251.389" dur="4.201">see at the end stage well wages are</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="4.5">pretty flat they haven&amp;#39;t really moved</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.17">anywhere interest rates where they were</text>
  <text start="258.019" dur="4.681">once high when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="8.629">standard they were battling inflation I</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="9.42">mean we saw interest rates like 17 18 %</text>
  <text start="268.389" dur="6.311">now what are they now they&amp;#39;re close to</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="6.54">zero other parts of the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="8.25">negative this is the end stage people</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="7.41">have trouble getting good-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="5.58">yes you can get a job but I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="7.45">about a good-paying job where you can</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="7.69">survive as the system breaks down</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.81">and if you notice and I&amp;#39;ve been in many</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="7.349">different stores you can now finance</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="6.28">everything clothes sneakers and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="303.569" dur="2.491">talking about credit cards I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="4.529">about</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;ll put you on a payment plan to to</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="7.881">allow you to acquire these items that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="9.63">how you know you&amp;#39;re at the end stage and</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="10.119">we know that the Patriots they need to</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="6.81">transition the people out of this dying</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="5.581">central bank system and into a new one</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="5.16">and it&amp;#39;s not just here the United States</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="5.099">there&amp;#39;s many moving parts to all of this</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="4.38">and this is why the biz is putting out a</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="4.231">warning because they know and they can</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="5.15">see what is happening we can see that</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="5.519">the Federal Reserve they are trapped</text>
  <text start="345.59" dur="4.449">Trump the Patriots they are dictating to</text>
  <text start="348.569" dur="3.991">the Federal Reserve what they need them</text>
  <text start="350.039" dur="6.481">to do to keep this entire system</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="9.05">operational and we see out in the UK we</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="8.31">see the move to detach the people from a</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="5.23">non-elected group which is the EU they</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="4.709">had a referendum and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="5.79">interesting about the UK it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="369.539" dur="6.361">the people in the UK once this happens</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="6.24">this is going to happen in many of the</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="6">other countries all the other countries</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="7.169">are sitting back waiting to see how this</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="11.549">plays out and if this plays out to the</text>
  <text start="386.039" dur="10.231">benefit of the UK the EU is in trouble</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="6.27">and I do believe that Boris Johnson he</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="6.449">is setting them up think about what</text>
  <text start="399.719" dur="6.781">Boris Johnson just did Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="402.719" dur="7.17">proposed a Northern Ireland solution do</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="6.69">you know this is what the EU originally</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="5.34">proposed it would involve Northern</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="5.699">Ireland alone remaining in the EU single</text>
  <text start="415.229" dur="5.521">market and a customs union which would</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="5.611">leave Great Britain England Scotland</text>
  <text start="420.75" dur="5.87">Wales free to strike trade deals but the</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="4.639">DUP in Northern Ireland</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="5.07">his party that propped up Teresa</text>
  <text start="429.139" dur="5.791">Teresa&amp;#39;s maze minority Conservative</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="3.99">government objected to this Boris</text>
  <text start="434.93" dur="5.13">Johnson</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="8.61">revived the idea somehow getting DUP on</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="9.18">board but now the EU seems united</text>
  <text start="444.29" dur="9.3">against its own idea what is Boris</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="8.37">Johnson achieved where everyone thought</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="9.21">that this could not be done what did he</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.82">do he was able to get a majority DUP is</text>
  <text start="462.8" dur="4.92">on board</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="9.239">rebel Labour MPs on board hard brexit</text>
  <text start="467.72" dur="9.569">errs on board most Tories on board so if</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="9.331">Ireland or the EU sink this deal the</text>
  <text start="477.289" dur="8.821">most likely consequence is No Deal polls</text>
  <text start="482" dur="7.44">show that Johnson will clobber Jeremy</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="6.36">Corbyn in an election the question is</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="6.24">does the the EU understand this yes I</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="6.12">believe they do the choice will be</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="8.76">between Johnson&amp;#39;s deal assuming he can</text>
  <text start="498.59" dur="9.389">work one out or no deal the EU is stuck</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="5.67">right now they&amp;#39;re in trouble yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.979" dur="2.611">trying to get an extension but guess</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="2.4">what</text>
  <text start="510.59" dur="4.02">we know that Boris Johnson only has to</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="6.719">do is say listen we don&amp;#39;t need an</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="9.66">extension it&amp;#39;s all he has to do and this</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="8.911">is the poster child for the rest of the</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="6.84">countries to do away with the globalist</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="6.17">regime now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="6.63">Trump is keeping the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="8.56">today we heard the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="10.02">and the rate fell to 3.5% this is the</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="7.469">best since 1969 Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="547.76" dur="6.21">following breaking news unemployment</text>
  <text start="550.339" dur="6.211">rate at 3.5% drops to a 50-year low Wow</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="5.82">America let&amp;#39;s impeach your president</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="5.64">even though he did nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="5.07">remember we know how these numbers are</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="5.16">calculated remember Trump is using it</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="4.77">all against the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="4.29">bank and the mainstream media they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="4.89">say that he&amp;#39;s manipulating this stuff</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="6.15">because this is exactly what they did in</text>
  <text start="574.52" dur="5.82">the past Obama did it Bush did it and</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="4.41">actually they just recalculate and</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="3.81">manipulated a little bit more every</text>
  <text start="582.2" dur="4.11">single time as we move forward</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="4.59">up until Trump Trump is just using</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="4.14">everything that they did and what is the</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="4.29">mainstream media gonna do what is the</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="5.4">Fed gonna do what is the deep state</text>
  <text start="593.03" dur="4.26">gonna do call them out on it all he has</text>
  <text start="595.85" dur="2.82">to do is say I haven&amp;#39;t changed anything</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="4.59">these are the calculations you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="5.82">using this is why they don&amp;#39;t attack them</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="5.1">on the economy this is why their only</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="4.74">weapon is to say all the indicators are</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="6.21">looking at a recession coming very very</text>
  <text start="609.23" dur="5.91">soon that&amp;#39;s all they can say but as we</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="4.35">know the Fed came out and said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="615.14" dur="4.7">predicting a recession anytime soon</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re not gonna go against the Fed</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="8.49">even though we know that Bernanke said</text>
  <text start="622.19" dur="9.39">this back in 2008 and we had a recession</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="6.43">Trump the Patriots they know that this</text>
  <text start="631.58" dur="6.36">economy it is teetering on not a</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="6.99">recession a total collapse</text>
  <text start="637.94" dur="6.36">I mean how bad is the central bank</text>
  <text start="641.75" dur="5.31">system we discussed it a little bit when</text>
  <text start="644.3" dur="6.36">we started this report but think about</text>
  <text start="647.06" dur="7.44">what has been going on think about how</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="8.52">the central bank system works the</text>
  <text start="654.5" dur="5.61">Millennials and those who are coming</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="3.93">after them</text>
  <text start="660.11" dur="5.7">are going to have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="6.72">in this economy those individuals that</text>
  <text start="665.81" dur="9.06">were born in the 50s or the 40s the 50s</text>
  <text start="669.83" dur="8.61">the 60s the 70s they benefited from the</text>
  <text start="674.87" dur="5.82">beginning stage of this central bank</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="7.89">system those individuals that are being</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="9.03">born in the late 80s the 90s 2000 they</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="4.72">are not benefiting from this central</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="3.55">bank system</text>
  <text start="691.05" dur="3.39">and when I say this I&amp;#39;m not saying every</text>
  <text start="693.27" dur="3.72">single person I&amp;#39;m saying the majority</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="4.74">yes there&amp;#39;s going to be those that know</text>
  <text start="696.99" dur="4.71">how to work around this system there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="4.59">going to be those that know how to work</text>
  <text start="701.7" dur="4.53">the stock market of course we&amp;#39;ve only</text>
  <text start="703.77" dur="4.47">seen the stock market go up since 2008</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="4.71">so they&amp;#39;ve never seen really a down</text>
  <text start="708.24" dur="5.52">market I mean I remember when I was</text>
  <text start="710.94" dur="6.03">working an investment company all the</text>
  <text start="713.76" dur="5.76">quant traders that were in there they</text>
  <text start="716.97" dur="4.59">were looking at the same this is so</text>
  <text start="719.52" dur="4.89">great this is fantastic look how easy</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="5.25">this is and during this period of time</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="5.73">they never saw a down market when we had</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="7.11">a down market I would say 90% of them</text>
  <text start="730.14" dur="6.93">had no clue what to do they lost money</text>
  <text start="733.92" dur="7.29">left and right and they were fired there</text>
  <text start="737.07" dur="7.92">was only 10% that were able to weather</text>

  <text start="816.21" dur="4.26">the gadgets and gadgets you know the</text>
  <text start="818.28" dur="6.18">chargers and all this stuff and I</text>
  <text start="820.47" dur="5.31">noticed the prices they had</text>
  <text start="824.46" dur="3.9">price of what it would be if you just</text>
  <text start="825.78" dur="5.34">paid for it in full and then they had a</text>
  <text start="828.36" dur="5.49">slash next to it and it said how much</text>
  <text start="831.12" dur="6.45">your monthly charge would be if you</text>
  <text start="833.85" dur="7.56">wanted to pay it out now I have never</text>
  <text start="837.57" dur="6.15">seen this before and now I am seeing it</text>
  <text start="841.41" dur="5.34">in more and more places and now we have</text>
  <text start="843.72" dur="8.37">startup companies that are now offering</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="6.62">payment plans to purchase everyday items</text>
  <text start="852.09" dur="4.62">this is not like going out and</text>
  <text start="853.37" dur="5.5">purchasing like a TV something you</text>
  <text start="856.71" dur="3.72">really don&amp;#39;t need we say you know</text>
  <text start="858.87" dur="3.87">something I really want that thousand</text>
  <text start="860.43" dur="5.37">dollar TV but I don&amp;#39;t have a thousand</text>
  <text start="862.74" dur="4.98">dollars but I can make fifty seventy</text>
  <text start="865.8" dur="4.05">five dollars a month because my credit</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="5.04">cards are all filled to the max so I</text>
  <text start="869.85" dur="5.52">can&amp;#39;t put them on that this is about</text>
  <text start="872.76" dur="6.6">purchasing a pair of sneakers this is</text>
  <text start="875.37" dur="6.6">about purchasing a sweater when we get</text>
  <text start="879.36" dur="6.09">down to the point where we need to put</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="6.57">this on payment plans we&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="885.45" dur="5.85">now Trump the Patriots they know this</text>
  <text start="888.54" dur="4.59">they know that this system will not last</text>
  <text start="891.3" dur="3.69">think about what we talked about in the</text>
  <text start="893.13" dur="3.27">beginning of this report when we went</text>
  <text start="894.99" dur="3.93">through the timeline of a central bank</text>
  <text start="896.4" dur="5.13">system where we went from like an</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="6.12">automobile where we went from oh you can</text>
  <text start="901.53" dur="5.16">pay it in cash because like in the 70s</text>
  <text start="905.04" dur="3.21">maybe it was three four thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="3.36">you know three you had three four</text>
  <text start="908.25" dur="5.94">thousand dollars because you saved it up</text>
  <text start="910.05" dur="5.4">maybe you didn&amp;#39;t - financing because</text>
  <text start="914.19" dur="4.2">people didn&amp;#39;t have the three four</text>
  <text start="915.45" dur="5.82">thousand - extending the financing and</text>
  <text start="918.39" dur="5.31">putting down bigger down payments then</text>
  <text start="921.27" dur="4.59">moving to leasing where it was zero down</text>
  <text start="923.7" dur="4.23">for maybe two or three years then it was</text>
  <text start="925.86" dur="4.05">leasing with a down payment</text>
  <text start="927.93" dur="5.49">then it was leasing with more of a down</text>
  <text start="929.91" dur="6.68">payment and extended terms think about</text>
  <text start="933.42" dur="5.97">it and then start to think about</text>
  <text start="936.59" dur="4.78">colleges where people used to be able to</text>
  <text start="939.39" dur="5.51">work and go to college and pay for</text>
  <text start="941.37" dur="6.51">college think about purchasing a home</text>
  <text start="944.9" dur="6.75">think about all of it how it all</text>
  <text start="947.88" dur="7.59">completely deteriorated as time went on</text>
  <text start="951.65" dur="5.559">we are at the end stage this is why</text>
  <text start="955.47" dur="5.63">Trump and the Patriots have been</text>
  <text start="957.209" dur="8.19">working so hard on the trade deals on</text>
  <text start="961.1" dur="7.06">regulations tax cuts destroying the</text>
  <text start="965.399" dur="5.73">globalist system there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="6.119">all this and now we&amp;#39;re moving into the</text>
  <text start="971.129" dur="6.421">next phase where Trump is really gonna</text>
  <text start="974.279" dur="5.9">push this the transition is being</text>
  <text start="977.55" dur="5.37">prepped and Trump has still more to do</text>
  <text start="980.179" dur="6.34">until we can move into this new system</text>
  <text start="982.92" dur="6.539">this is why he&amp;#39;s keeping this central</text>
  <text start="986.519" dur="6.5">bank system from imploding there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="989.459" dur="6.12">reason for this so we can transition</text>
  <text start="993.019" dur="4.901">without having the system collapse think</text>
  <text start="995.579" dur="4.35">about it if the system collapsed and he</text>
  <text start="997.92" dur="5.099">tried to transition everyone out of it</text>
  <text start="999.929" dur="5.611">it would be a disaster it would be a lot</text>
  <text start="1003.019" dur="5.19">better if the system stayed afloat and</text>
  <text start="1005.54" dur="4.859">then he transitioned everyone into the</text>
  <text start="1008.209" dur="5.99">new economic system put us back on sound</text>
  <text start="1010.399" dur="5.641">money and I do believe this is the plan</text>
