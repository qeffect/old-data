  <text start="124.17" dur="3.57">last phase of everything they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="5.31">doing now think about what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="6.029">doing in the past they duplicated the</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="5.16">payment system which they duplicated the</text>

  <text start="142.17" dur="5.52">petrol ruble they&amp;#39;ve been hoarding a lot</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="6.481">of gold and they&amp;#39;ve been separating</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="5.25">themselves from the dollar now four of</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="4.44">these nations are among the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="6.72">major gold producers namely China Russia</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="6.24">South Africa and Brazil furthermore two</text>

  <text start="162.18" dur="5.339">largest importers and consumers of</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="5.46">physical gold namely China and Russia so</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="5.611">that these economies have in common is</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="5.91">that they are all major players in the</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="5.4">global physical gold market now the</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="4.14">Memorandum of Understanding on gold</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="4.74">trading between the Bank of Russia and</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="5.31">the people Bank of China referred to</text>
  <text start="183.27" dur="3.84">what was actually signed in September of</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="3.15">this year</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="4.11">the deputy governors of the two central</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="5.64">banks jointly chaired an inter country</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="6.03">meeting on financial cooperation in the</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="7.98">Russian city of Sochi now the Chinese</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="9.09">central bank still officially claims to</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="6.03">hold around 1842 tons of gold in its</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.11">national gold reserves it looks like the</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="3.75">Bank of Russia as soon as the first</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="4.47">quarter 2018 will have the distinction</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.16">of holding more gold than the Chinese</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="3.96">now of course the Chinese might come out</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="3.03">and say they have a lot more than they</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="4.44">are saying but at this point it looks</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="5.91">like Russia is taking the lead now they</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="6.21">want to establish a new gold pricing</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="6.54">benchmark now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="6.09">second the gold trading in London and on</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="4.59">the comics is really trading at very</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="5.07">large quantities of synthetic</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="5.85">derivatives on gold which are completely</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="5.82">detached from the physical gold market</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="5.599">what these countries want to do is they</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="6.6">want a price gold on the physical market</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="6.191">now of course central banking the</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="4.559">central banks isn&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="5.76">especially when the system is being</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="5.491">driven by stimulus creating more</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="3.72">currency out of thin air making sure</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s a paper market making sure you</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t like gold the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="5.76">moving into a physical gold trading</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="6.72">system is because the system we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="6.18">right now is ending and they have to</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="3.78">make sure that everyone is confident in</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="2.94">the new system this is where people get</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="4.5">a little confused</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="5.55">Russia and China this is still the</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="4.05">central banking system and the central</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="4.05">bank&amp;#39;s what they like to do is they like</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="5.64">to trick the public where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="5.58">oh this is the old system and it was</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="4.71">paper driven and it was out of control</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="3.84">and I mean they don&amp;#39;t come out and say</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="3.27">this but this is what they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="3.12">doing right now and everyone looks at</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="3.51">that and says ok look what they did they</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="5.52">put the world in the debt this is a new</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="5.19">system and we are backing this by real</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="4.41">money so there&amp;#39;s all the checks and</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="4.829">balances and nobody can print much more</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="5.129">than they really need and they make the</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="4.201">world believe that this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="2.311">going to do and then eventually</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="2.7">going to happen they going to take us</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="3.99">off the gold system and they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="5.01">the whole thing all over again now again</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="5.97">they just can&amp;#39;t do this they need a</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="5.46">distraction they need something to take</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="3.66">everyone and say look over here this is</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="4.35">the reason why the old system died</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="5.4">because of cyberattacks because of a war</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="4.89">or because of anything else and after</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="4.74">this whole entire event or war whatever</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="3.6">we have this is why we need to go on to</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="2.91">the new system and this is how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="4.29">starting in the system and they make it</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="6.51">seem really really good so this new</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="6.99">system is going to allow the BRICS to</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="5.52">become more independent of the US trade</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="4.56">influence Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="5.22">preparing to launch oil futures market</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="5.43">in st. Petersburg and Shanghai with oil</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="4.26">being priced in rubles and you won and</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="3.41">we can see that they&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="4.77">this because what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="5.92">everything is shifting right now so</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="4.23">first of all it&amp;#39;s going to reduce the US</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="3.54">dollar dominance in the world trade</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="3.72">second it will increase the price of</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="4.05">gold on the world markets in general</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="4.8">third it will probably make the BRICS</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="5.37">more independent of the US influence in</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="4.83">regards of trade such an initiative will</text>
  <text start="390" dur="4.38">signal an important fundamental change</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="5.46">and the BRICS will receive the benefits</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="5.79">from all this it will also signal the</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="6.03">West that they need to follow suit or</text>
  <text start="400.17" dur="6.27">lose out economically and we see right</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="5.01">now that the central bank the Cabal here</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="5.73">in the United States they are trying to</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="6.12">hold on to the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="4.77">they don&amp;#39;t want to let it go because</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.56">think about all the power they have they</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="4.32">have the world reserve currency they can</text>
  <text start="419.19" dur="4.08">play sanctions on other countries they</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="4.38">can force countries to do things</text>
  <text start="423.27" dur="4.86">economically and if they don&amp;#39;t they send</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="4.68">in the troops they send in you know the</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="5.16">strong arm to force them to do what they</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="6.24">want this is all coming to an end the</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="5.13">reset is already in motion we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="3.96">watching the whole thing play out right</text>
  <text start="438.42" dur="4.26">now and we&amp;#39;ve been watching this for a</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="3.42">very long time if we go back just two or</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="4.38">three years ago when everyone was</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="6.18">laughing and saying oh there&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="447.06" dur="5.61">to be a duplicate payment system in</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="3.69">Russia or China now there is oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.67" dur="3.66">not going to create</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="4.29">a whole trading system in China now</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="5.67">there is oh they&amp;#39;re not going to create</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="4.41">a physical gold trading system well here</text>
  <text start="462" dur="2.31">it comes</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="4.56">oh they&amp;#39;re not going to create the</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="4.2">petrol you want or the you want is not</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="4.41">going to be included in the SDR basket</text>
  <text start="468.51" dur="5.4">well here it is everything that we</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="5.61">talked about everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="473.91" dur="5.22">saying has been happening now of course</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="2.73">just because we say it it doesn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="3.57">the next day</text>
  <text start="479.82" dur="6.14">these things take time they knew it it</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="7.23">took these central banks to move all</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="6.58">manufacturing out of the US to move</text>
  <text start="489.93" dur="7.17">everything someplace else and to</text>
  <text start="492.54" dur="7.26">establish it out in Asia they knew that</text>
  <text start="497.1" dur="4.319">this system was going to die and they</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="3.72">knew that they just couldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="4.711">in a year or two it would take a very</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="5.13">long time and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="5.099">doing it for a very long time and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="5.009">been accelerating in the last what eight</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="4.5">years or so since the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="513.659" dur="4.171">of 2008 because they realized well</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="4.291">things are coming to an end very very</text>
  <text start="517.83" dur="3.81">quickly and we see right now they</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="5.37">definitely are and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="521.64" dur="6.84">the last stage setting up a petrol u one</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="6.12">setting up a petrol ruble setting up a</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="5.82">physical gold exchange the countries</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.44">have been buying gold left and right</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="3.12">these are the countries that trading</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="4.02">gold these are the countries that have</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="6.03">gold and you can see right now they are</text>
  <text start="539.97" dur="5.49">almost ready to move everything the one</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="3.72">thing they need is a distraction and</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="3.09">this is why you need to be prepared and</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="4.14">ready because we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="4.77">all of this is being done and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="4.17">moving at a faster and faster pace</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="4.98">because they realize they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.94">keep this entire system together and if</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.01">they can&amp;#39;t keep it together well the</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="3.06">whole system falls apart and it will be</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="3.75">blamed on the central bank now they</text>
  <text start="564.48" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t let this happen because if they do</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="3.719">let it happen the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="4.26">gonna say well wait a minute the central</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="3.93">banks they manage the entire economy not</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="4.29">just here in the US but around the world</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="5.791">and the entire system just crashed</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="5.219">because of too much debt because of what</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;ve done because of stimulus they</text>
  <text start="582.839" dur="3.991">cannot let this happen this is why you</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="2.61">can be assured that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="3.569">some type of</text>
  <text start="587.699" dur="4.711">traction to show that oh this is the</text>
  <text start="590.399" dur="5.85">real reason or this is the fake reason</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="5.849">why the economy came down and later on</text>
  <text start="596.249" dur="4.2">they can say well because the economy</text>
  <text start="598.259" dur="4.5">was brought down we need to restart it</text>
  <text start="600.449" dur="4.86">someplace else because the citizens were</text>
  <text start="602.759" dur="5.1">very damaged in the u.s. the banking</text>
  <text start="605.309" dur="4.351">system was very damaged in the US and we</text>
  <text start="607.859" dur="4.26">need to move it someplace else and look</text>
  <text start="609.66" dur="4.019">just so happens that Russia China and</text>
  <text start="612.119" dur="3.57">the other nations they all have this</text>
  <text start="613.679" dur="4.95">gold which people are looking this ins</text>
  <text start="615.689" dur="4.8">they see stability they see that oh okay</text>
  <text start="618.629" dur="3.721">this could be a system that we can use</text>
  <text start="620.489" dur="4.14">and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been doing it</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="6.029">all along because they need to show the</text>
  <text start="624.629" dur="6.33">world that you can have faith in the new</text>
  <text start="628.379" dur="3.74">system so no matter what&amp;#39;s going no</text>
  <text start="630.959" dur="3.42">matter what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="632.119" dur="4.09">everything is getting ready for this</text>
  <text start="634.379" dur="3.091">major reset and I know people been</text>
  <text start="636.209" dur="3.75">talking about a reset for a long time</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="4.32">but it takes a long time to move</text>
  <text start="639.959" dur="4.201">everything without people really</text>
  <text start="641.79" dur="3.899">noticing they notice a little bit but</text>
  <text start="644.16" dur="3.899">they don&amp;#39;t understand why this is all</text>
  <text start="645.689" dur="4.11">happening and in the end when you look</text>
