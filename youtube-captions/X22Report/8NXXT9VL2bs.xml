  <text start="68.09" dur="5.669">and geopolitical news now we can see the</text>
  <text start="71.24" dur="5.07">recount process is still happening</text>
  <text start="73.759" dur="5.761">Trump is filing lawsuits Stein is filing</text>
  <text start="76.31" dur="4.83">lawsuits and the recount is really</text>
  <text start="79.52" dur="3.66">showing absolutely nothing at this point</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="4.14">but we knew this is not what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="83.18" dur="3.24">about it&amp;#39;s not about who&amp;#39;s gonna win</text>
  <text start="85.28" dur="3.27">with the recount</text>
  <text start="86.42" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s about stalling it&amp;#39;s about keeping</text>
  <text start="88.55" dur="5.429">the electoral votes out of the picture</text>
  <text start="91.34" dur="5.88">hopefully they can keep this going</text>
  <text start="93.979" dur="6.601">installing past December 19th that is</text>
  <text start="97.22" dur="5.31">their plan and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="100.58" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="7.949">to keep this up because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="106.28" dur="7.74">to manipulate the electoral college</text>
  <text start="110.479" dur="6.151">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going after and time</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="5.549">is of the essence we have 14 days until</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="6.48">we hit that spot so we will see them</text>
  <text start="119.569" dur="6.811">ramp up whatever they&amp;#39;re doing to try to</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="7.8">derail what is going to happen on</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="7.34">December 19th now in Afghanistan we see</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="7.65">the UN and the u.s. commanders well</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="8.56">they&amp;#39;re basically not agreeing on</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="5.759">anything and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="6.51">u.s. is saying listen we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="144.319" dur="7.771">to kick the UN out of the Kabul base why</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="5.94">is that because the US and the UN well</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re differing on the war reports on</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="5.339">what&amp;#39;s really going on there</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="7.051">and we see that they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="5.851">US where they&amp;#39;re flying drones they are</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="5.82">killing a lot of civilians in the nen</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="4.289">gara province and the u.s. is saying no</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re not killing civilians we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="5.31">killing only the Islamic state and the</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="5.07">reports well they&amp;#39;re not matching up</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="6.901">right now and we know from the past that</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="6.68">yes the u.s. many of the targets are</text>
  <text start="182.42" dur="5.64">children many of the targets are women</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.769">families and this has been proven in the</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="4.86">past in the u.s. I said yes we&amp;#39;ve looked</text>
  <text start="190.489" dur="4.83">at the situation and it is true and it</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.83">looks like at this point it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="195.319" dur="5.491">worse and worse as time goes on because</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="6.27">who are they actually hitting right now</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="7.85">because the Islamic state that&amp;#39;s a group</text>
  <text start="204.02" dur="9.15">that is created by the United States</text>
  <text start="208.66" dur="10.81">created by the CIA the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="213.17" dur="8.52">to be used to create fear to be used so</text>
  <text start="219.47" dur="6.329">the US can have regime change in many of</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="6.96">the countries we see the British Foreign</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="6.531">Secretary Boris Johnson well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="6.23">dismissing any type of criticism about</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="6.129">the British arms sales to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="6.82">saying that you know what I don&amp;#39;t see a</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="6.511">war crime here doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="5.909">civilians are killed in Saudi Arabia it</text>
  <text start="244.97" dur="4.59">makes no difference we haven&amp;#39;t crossed</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="5.011">the threshold well when we look at the</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="4.019">situation in Yemen Yemen never invaded</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="3">Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="253.579" dur="4.91">why did Saudi Arabia have to go into</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="5.52">Yemen I mean that was an act of war they</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="5.471">decided to have war with Yemen the</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="5.31">people well they were having an internal</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.519">coup saying we don&amp;#39;t want this puppet</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="5.76">government in Yemen anymore and of</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="4.411">course the United States the UK well</text>
  <text start="272.21" dur="5.09">they use Saudi Arabia as their proxy</text>
  <text start="273.89" dur="5.58">army to do their bidding and this is why</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="4.6">the British Foreign Secretary Boris</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.23">Johnson is out there trying to keep</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="4.769">everything on track but we can see right</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="5.279">now the Houthis have the control and the</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="4.5">control is not Saudi Arabia the control</text>
  <text start="288.979" dur="4.591">is not the puppet government and things</text>
  <text start="291.169" dur="4.591">are falling apart in that area and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="5.969">seeing it fall apart rapidly all over</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="5.19">the place even in Iraq the United</text>
  <text start="299.539" dur="4.531">Nations right now they have agreed to</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="7.14">stop recording casualty figures in the</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="6.03">war in Iraq because Iraq is complaining</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="4.41">that the UN numbers are completely off</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="4.2">that the number of security forces that</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re reporting that have died they</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="5.339">really haven&amp;#39;t died</text>
  <text start="316.31" dur="6.15">and right now the Iraqi army officials</text>
  <text start="319.639" dur="5.641">they haven&amp;#39;t really offered any type of</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="6.06">count of how many of their fighters have</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="5.52">actually died in the fight so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="5.49">having problems all over the place where</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="5.82">none of these numbers are matching up we</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="3.78">see the Libyan army seize control of the</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="3.269">country they declared a state of</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="3.69">emergency and it looks like there is a</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="3.511">power struggle right down what looks</text>
  <text start="341.48" dur="4.64">like the people are saying they want</text>
  <text start="343.4" dur="5.07">their country back the unity government</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="5.46">looks like they have no power whatsoever</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="6.99">and it looks like the United States is</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="7.06">running into problems in Yemen in Libya</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="7.32">in Iraq and Lebanon and in Syria the</text>
  <text start="358.64" dur="7.35">whole entire campaign to keep the</text>
  <text start="362.78" dur="7.5">petrodollar alive is completely falling</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="9.739">apart now while all this is happening we</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="9.06">see the Syrian army the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="6.071">they have about 52% of East Aleppo now</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="4.95">under control of the Syrian army and of</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="4.65">course now John Kerry is out there well</text>
  <text start="384.29" dur="7.2">now he wants to have talks with Lavrov</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="6.719">and he&amp;#39;s made a proposal to say okay</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="4.73">listen we&amp;#39;re gonna withdraw the rebel</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="7.381">forces and we&amp;#39;re gonna take them out of</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="6.87">Aleppo now US Secretary of State latest</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="4.619">offer for all jihadis to leave Aleppo</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="4.09">appears to be an attempt to get the</text>
  <text start="405.169" dur="4.321">Russians to agree to a ceasefire in</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="5.16">order to preserve the al Qaeda control</text>
  <text start="409.49" dur="6.03">pocket in eastern Aleppo maybe until</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="6.079">Obama leaves office because remember</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.88">Obama is very worried about his legacy</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="5.801">he wants to leave office with an economy</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="4.68">that has recovered his campaigns in the</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="3.87">Middle East are a complete success and</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="4.02">whatever happens after he leaves office</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="6.26">well they&amp;#39;ll just blame that on the next</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="7.16">administration but what happened was</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="5.62">Lavrov called</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="5.23">Kerry&amp;#39;s Bluff by demanding that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="6.24">come up with concrete proposals and a</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="7.26">definite timetable for the withdrawal of</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="8.15">the terrorists not in four weeks</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="8.04">a year with the next couple of days so</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="7.5">that plan is falling apart now the EU is</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="8.85">saying well we have another plan here</text>
  <text start="461.86" dur="7">and Assad they call it retirement he</text>
  <text start="466.64" dur="5.25">doesn&amp;#39;t have to retire well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="7.05">what they were after they&amp;#39;re saying he</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="7.71">can stay as long as they allow and give</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="6.48">power to the rebel forces the EU is</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="5.819">planning to offer Damascus financial aid</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="4.77">which means debt in exchange for</text>
  <text start="485.419" dur="3.991">allowing the rebel forces to stay in</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="7.92">power in some of the regions of Syria so</text>
  <text start="489.41" dur="10.38">they&amp;#39;re using debt as a blackmail type</text>
  <text start="495.08" dur="7.17">of leverage to kind of get their way and</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="8.61">this is coming from foreign policy chief</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="10.409">federica mogherini saying that we will</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="9.24">do this and we will help out and help</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="7.581">out rebuild Syria if you accept this</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="6.84">deal because they realize at this point</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="7.57">there&amp;#39;s no way out of this they are done</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="5.609">in Syria now of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="5.13">media is out there pushing a lot of fake</text>
  <text start="530.089" dur="4.231">news the washing Washington Post they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="2.73">warning actually what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re covering their tracks right now</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="4.74">and they&amp;#39;re out there warning that no</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.02">the armed groups in Syria previously</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="3.84">vetted by the u.s. to receive weapons</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="7.529">for the CIA channels well they might</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="8.88">join the terrorist groups and this might</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="4.921">happen if Trump abandons them well</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re already part of the terrorist</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="6.57">groups they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="5.58">possibly can using fake information to</text>
  <text start="561.08" dur="6">convince everyone that when Trump comes</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="5.85">into office all of a sudden these rebels</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="4.11">are going to turn into terrorists</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="4.159">they&amp;#39;re already terrorists but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="5.22">trying to cover their tracks right now</text>
  <text start="573.339" dur="5.081">now we understand that this is a no-win</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="5.91">situation for the u.s. in the Middle</text>
  <text start="578.42" dur="5.22">East and this all revolves around the</text>
  <text start="582.32" dur="4.519">petro dollar</text>
  <text start="583.64" dur="6.54">the petrodollar right now is doomed</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="5.201">remember the US needs to maintain</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="4.83">control in this entire area</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="4.41">if the petro dollar does not exist and</text>
  <text start="595.01" dur="3.389">we can see already Turkey is turning</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="3.15">away from the dollar many of these other</text>
  <text start="598.399" dur="4.411">countries well it&amp;#39;s gonna be like a</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="5.31">domino effect just like the people in</text>
  <text start="602.81" dur="4.08">Italy the people in the UK the people in</text>
  <text start="604.91" dur="5.04">France who are saying we don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="5.009">EU we don&amp;#39;t want the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="3.569">same things gonna happen within all</text>
  <text start="611.899" dur="3.991">these countries they&amp;#39;re gonna say we</text>
  <text start="613.519" dur="5.371">don&amp;#39;t want to use the dollar to sell the</text>
  <text start="615.89" dur="4.98">oil and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="618.89" dur="5.97">for quite a while and here we are at</text>
  <text start="620.87" dur="7.08">this point and these countries are going</text>
  <text start="624.86" dur="5.52">to stop using the dollar and it looks</text>
  <text start="627.95" dur="4.11">like we&amp;#39;re moving towards that period of</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="6.769">time which is coming up very very</text>
  <text start="632.06" dur="8.01">quickly and when this happens guess what</text>
  <text start="637.149" dur="6.19">other countries will not keep the dollar</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="6">in their reserves those dollars and</text>
  <text start="643.339" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;ve been exporting inflation to all</text>
  <text start="646.07" dur="5.129">these countries for a very long time</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="7.04">it&amp;#39;s all coming back we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="651.199" dur="6.661">a flood of currency back here in the US</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.71">now are the central bankers the elite</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="5.43">just gonna let this happen</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="7.18">maybe but I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="663.29" dur="4.859">down without a fight I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.44" dur="4.56">gonna want a huge distraction</text>
  <text start="668.149" dur="5.041">I don&amp;#39;t think Trump is enough of a</text>
  <text start="671" dur="4.14">distraction because he just got into</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="3.78">office and if they actually bring down</text>
  <text start="675.14" dur="3.84">the economy like we expect a couple</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="3.63">months into his administration will</text>
  <text start="678.98" dur="3.169">people actually believe this because</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="4.2">okay he&amp;#39;s been there for four months</text>
  <text start="682.149" dur="5.651">yeah we can blame them but I think they</text>
  <text start="684.8" dur="4.289">need something else because people are</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="2.82">gonna say well wait a mere four four</text>
  <text start="689.089" dur="3.36">months you&amp;#39;re telling me in four months</text>
  <text start="690.62" dur="3.93">this strong economy he was able to crash</text>
  <text start="692.449" dur="3.741">by doing how much does he really get</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="4.529">done in four months</text>
  <text start="696.19" dur="7.53">most likely not that much so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="699.079" dur="8.041">gonna need something else now we see two</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="5.53">ships two and fibia ships they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="4.56">entered the Mediterranean we mentioned</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="5.06">this on Sunday they have about 4,000</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="6.86">Marines to the wasp and the Whitby</text>
  <text start="714.31" dur="9">and are they using this to evacuate</text>
  <text start="718.54" dur="7.62">whatever out there are they using this</text>
  <text start="723.31" dur="7.649">to have an invasion maybe an invading</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="9.659">ground force into the area because this</text>
  <text start="730.959" dur="8.85">is very suspect at this point and we can</text>
  <text start="735.819" dur="6.601">see that this is a little unusual right</text>
  <text start="739.809" dur="8.28">now because we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="742.42" dur="9.69">that there&amp;#39;s no reason for these two</text>
  <text start="748.089" dur="6.841">ships to be in the area unless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="752.11" dur="7.139">going to use them for some particular</text>
  <text start="754.93" dur="7.709">reason we know we have forces in Syria</text>

  <text start="772.629" dur="4.471">can we&amp;#39;re looking at all these</text>
  <text start="774.339" dur="5.49">indicators and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="777.1" dur="5.609">something is definitely planned what it</text>
  <text start="779.829" dur="5.43">is we don&amp;#39;t know what it is yet but we</text>
  <text start="782.709" dur="7.86">can see that something is moving in that</text>
  <text start="785.259" dur="7.02">direction and like I said the United</text>
  <text start="790.569" dur="3.531">States government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="792.279" dur="7.321">the elite they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="794.1" dur="8.969">their system is about to unravel the</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="7.62">entire economic system is about to crash</text>
  <text start="803.069" dur="6.01">if they don&amp;#39;t do something create some</text>
  <text start="807.22" dur="5.46">type of an event some type of</text>
  <text start="809.079" dur="8.661">distraction it will be blamed on them</text>
  <text start="812.68" dur="7.44">and like we said we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="817.74" dur="6.49">tactical nuke that was smuggled into</text>

  <text start="835.689" dur="6.69">readied and this is what we have been</text>
  <text start="838.179" dur="5.791">following and looking at now Russia has</text>
