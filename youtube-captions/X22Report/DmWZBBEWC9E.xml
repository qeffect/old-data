  <text start="49.23" dur="4.59">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="4.5">financial news now since the Fed has</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="2.519">announced that they&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="3.869">the Fed fund rate by a quarter</text>
  <text start="56.339" dur="4.951">percentage from we have seen the stock</text>
  <text start="58.979" dur="3.75">market completely take a dive now will</text>

  <text start="64.1" dur="4.42">readjust everything and try to pump this</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="3.991">up once again but at this point right</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="6.63">now we&amp;#39;re seeing that people are not</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="5.369">feeling and believing that we are in a</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="3.359">recovery and this was the right thing</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="4.111">for the Fed to do this is actually a</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="4.29">signal to tell us that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="7.559">towards a collapse they&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="8.371">rates in a weak economy they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="88.079" dur="5.641">the rates in an economy that has been</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.739">completely manipulated I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="4.529">talking about the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="95.909" dur="4.651">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at facts pure facts</text>
  <text start="98.249" dur="4.68">not propaganda from the government not</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="4.68">propaganda from Obama not propaganda</text>
  <text start="102.929" dur="4.89">from the central bank&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="5.699">looking at hard facts of what the</text>
  <text start="107.819" dur="5.22">economy has been doing we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.591">looking at the real layoffs remember the</text>
  <text start="113.039" dur="5.701">government got rid of the department</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="5.519">that counts layoffs back in 2013 budget</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="3.78">cuts of course but then we had to go to</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="3.18">a private company Challenger grand</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="4.26">Christmas we had a look at the layoffs</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="4.381">there which shows us almost a million</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.45">people have been laid off since June of</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="6.599">2014 and we&amp;#39;ve seen more and more</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="7.99">layoffs we&amp;#39;ve been seeing declining</text>
  <text start="135.209" dur="7.11">sales since the Fed came out and said</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="4.98">okay we&amp;#39;re gonna be raising the interest</text>
  <text start="142.319" dur="6.541">rate we&amp;#39;ve noticed strange things have</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="6.21">occurred city says well since we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="3.66">recovery and since the Fed tells us that</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="2.76">everything is fine in there raising</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="4.049">rates we&amp;#39;re gonna have to let 2,000</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="7.35">people go starting next month well that</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="7.321">makes complete sense because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="2.82">telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery that</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="3.03">every</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="5.07">is fine we&amp;#39;re adding more and more jobs</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="4.95">but every time we look there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="5.7">mm there&amp;#39;s another 10,000 there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="6.6">another 85,000 jobs being removed from</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="5.519">the system and then we look at the</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="5.25">participation rate that people have</text>
  <text start="180.629" dur="5.911">fallen off who really want a job</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="7.11">but just can&amp;#39;t find it there&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="6.77">hundred million people plus so then we</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="8.58">look at other indicators and other</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="9.58">factors we look at manufacturing we look</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="7.859">at non manufacturing PMI which has now</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="6.05">plunged to 2015 lows market reported</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.201">that America&amp;#39;s services economy</text>

  <text start="218.37" dur="5.699">January of 2015 and employment</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.3">completely tumbled market said this is</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="5.341">disappointing news for an economy which</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="6.15">has seen the first US interest rate hike</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="7.35">for almost a decade the Kansas City Fed</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="6.63">survey collapses the new orders</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="8.58">completely crash this is the most since</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="9.17">that the Great Recession of 2008 Kansas</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="10.47">City Fed collapsed to a negative nine I</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="11.19">mean we have seen one two three four</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="11.22">five six seven eight nine negative</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="7.3">Kansas City Fed surveys in a row what</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="2.85">does that tell us</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.26">you you know when the last time we saw</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="8.599">something like this was during the Great</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="8.16">Recession again hard economic facts</text>
  <text start="278.479" dur="7.571">something is wrong the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="7.02">is at 477 points and we see why</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="2.45">manufacturing is completely falling</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="4.32">apart</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="6.07">another hard fact to tell us that yeah</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="4.11">what the Fed is telling us and what the</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="3.37">government is telling us is completely</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="7.24">fake phony and false</text>

  <text start="325.81" dur="7.11">month down to a negative 11% in November</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="6.22">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="332.92" dur="7.8">during the Great Recession we had 19</text>
  <text start="335.92" dur="8.79">months of declining annual sales right</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.67">now in a recovery where the Fed and the</text>

  <text start="374.23" dur="7.29">manipulated to fool everyone and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="5.37">going to continually do this throughout</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="7.02">2016 actually they&amp;#39;re going to put it in</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="6.269">overdrive why it&amp;#39;s an election year this</text>
  <text start="388.54" dur="6.3">is what they do they make everything</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="7.171">look a lot better than it really is to</text>

  <text start="401.74" dur="5.28">happened they&amp;#39;re going to be completely</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="7.11">confused and dazed when this system</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="8.33">falls apart and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="8.91">these central bankers they&amp;#39;re not gods</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="5.86">they don&amp;#39;t have magical powers most of</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="2.85">them have been bought off by</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="4.89">corporations central banks foreign</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="5.1">governments they&amp;#39;re not even working for</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="3.72">the people anymore they&amp;#39;re working for</text>
  <text start="428.05" dur="3.839">themselves to make themselves wealthier</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="3.36">in wealthier doing things</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="2.49">because people have put them in office</text>
  <text start="433.18" dur="3.15">actually I should say corporations</text>
  <text start="434.379" dur="7.07">foreign governments central banks will</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="8.429">put them in office and their goal is</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="4.541">always the same now they might have to</text>
  <text start="444.759" dur="3.24">come up with new plans because a lot of</text>
  <text start="445.99" dur="4.35">their plans don&amp;#39;t work out a lot of</text>
  <text start="447.999" dur="4.5">their plans have been interrupted which</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="3.419">made it go longer and longer for this</text>
  <text start="452.499" dur="3.091">collapse a lot of times they have to</text>
  <text start="453.759" dur="3.18">manipulate everything to make it look</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="5.28">like this but eventually you know what</text>
  <text start="456.939" dur="7.051">happens it falls apart you can&amp;#39;t keep it</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="5.849">going and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.549">right now no matter what they do yes</text>
  <text start="466.719" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;ll try to continue it on but</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="7.62">eventually and this is a fact because we</text>
  <text start="473.349" dur="5.43">saw it back in 2006-2007 when they were</text>
  <text start="477.159" dur="3.6">certain people out there saying this</text>
  <text start="478.779" dur="4.41">system is gonna come down and of course</text>
  <text start="480.759" dur="4.231">we had all the financial pundants the</text>
  <text start="483.189" dur="3.241">government the Fed out there saying</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re ridiculous we have more</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="4.079">propaganda to tell you why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="6.089">going to happen you&amp;#39;re crazy and guess</text>
  <text start="490.509" dur="6.72">what it fell apart the same things going</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="4.53">to happen right now no difference</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="4.081">whatsoever actually there is a</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="4.131">difference this time it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="5.009">worse</text>
  <text start="502.8" dur="7.66">now we know Congress just passed the</text>
  <text start="506.319" dur="9.63">Omnibus the spending bill and there are</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="10.92">certain things inside this bill that the</text>
  <text start="515.949" dur="8.82">people of America don&amp;#39;t want but they</text>
  <text start="521.38" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t care about that once again so</text>
  <text start="524.769" dur="5.76">basically Congress&amp;#39;s elimination of</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="5.49">country-of-origin meat labels for pork</text>
  <text start="530.529" dur="4.261">and beef that consumers rely on to make</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="4.71">informed choices about their food is a</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="4.53">glaring example of how trade agreements</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="5.389">can undermine US public interest</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="5.91">policies public citizens said today that</text>
  <text start="542.579" dur="4.63">the World Trade Organization approved a</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.109">1 billion in annual trade sanctions</text>
  <text start="547.209" dur="5.07">against the United States unless until</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="4.591">the policy was terminated a provision to</text>
  <text start="552.279" dur="4.141">kill the popular consumer labels for</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="7.349">peva and pork was tucked into the</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="7.109">omnibus package passed today what else</text>
  <text start="561.279" dur="4.471">is in there well they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="563.529" dur="4.471">bringing in illegals over the border</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="5.43">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be getting jobs all</text>
  <text start="568" dur="5.24">the low paying jobs to continually pump</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="5.69">up these bubbles sisse</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="5.46">was placed in their hidden once again</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="5.44">now sisse</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="6.76">was gaining no traction whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="6">what they did was they took it and they</text>
  <text start="585.46" dur="5.94">quietly put it in the Omnibus pretending</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="9.09">it doesn&amp;#39;t exist and it made it past</text>
  <text start="591.4" dur="8.85">everything and basically this bill that</text>
  <text start="597.4" dur="4.62">they put in there it creates the ability</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="4.08">for the president to set up portals for</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="7.02">agencies like the FBI and many others</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="6.09">like the NSA so companies can hand over</text>
  <text start="609.04" dur="2.88">the information directly to law</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="3.27">enforcement and intelligence agency</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="3.75">instead to the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="3.33">Security it also changes when</text>
  <text start="615.67" dur="3.59">information shared for cybersecurity</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="6.18">reasons can be used for law enforcement</text>
  <text start="619.26" dur="7.11">investigations so they got this bill</text>
  <text start="623.2" dur="6.72">that has been kicked around for years</text>
  <text start="626.37" dur="5.62">nobody wanted to touch it so they</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="6.51">slipped it into the Omni not omnibus</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="6.87">bill and all of this that&amp;#39;s in there is</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="3.9">moving over to the president now of</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="3.99">course the president was out there</text>
  <text start="640.33" dur="4.77">saying he&amp;#39;s going to veto this is a bill</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="5.69">that&amp;#39;s too controversial no we will not</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="6.75">do this to the American people but today</text>
  <text start="648.54" dur="9.07">as he&amp;#39;s presented with the 1.1 trillion</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="9.21">budget bill he says yeah I&amp;#39;ll most</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="6.24">likely sign this so everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="5.85">told us everything he&amp;#39;s done is a</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="6.42">complete lie once again and believe me</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="7.02">he will be signing this bill in the</text>
  <text start="670.27" dur="6.26">cover of night and all of these secret</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="6.87">things that were all placed in there</text>
  <text start="676.53" dur="6.82">will now be law and this is something</text>
  <text start="680.8" dur="5.01">that we need to change there should be</text>
  <text start="683.35" dur="5.58">only one bill and nothing else attached</text>
  <text start="685.81" dur="3.95">to it that goes to the president each</text>
  <text start="688.93" dur="4.11">time</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="6.4">none of this sneaking things in hiding</text>
  <text start="693.04" dur="6.57">this putting a writer on that one bill</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="7.109">one topic that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="699.61" dur="6.81">and we would clear this all up now will</text>
  <text start="703.269" dur="4.831">M middle coupe is out there talking</text>
  <text start="706.42" dur="4.26">about his big reset I did an interview</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="4.109">with him a while back on the x-22 report</text>
  <text start="710.68" dur="4.32">spotlight and he talked about the big</text>
  <text start="712.209" dur="5.281">reset and he said that China understands</text>
  <text start="715" dur="5.67">that Russia constitutes the first domino</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="6.15">if Russia was the fall China would be</text>
  <text start="720.67" dur="5.82">next these two states are together</text>
  <text start="723.64" dur="7.8">moving to create a parallel financial</text>
  <text start="726.49" dur="7.8">system completely and separate from the</text>
  <text start="731.44" dur="5.12">Western financial system that&amp;#39;s why both</text>
