  <text start="117.7" dur="6.3">missile and the missile test didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="120.52" dur="5.16">that well basically it blew up and it</text>
  <text start="124" dur="3.72">really didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere but Donald</text>
  <text start="125.68" dur="4.89">Trump was out there and he said the</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="4.769">following North Korea disrespected the</text>
  <text start="130.57" dur="4.56">wishes of China and it&amp;#39;s highly</text>
  <text start="132.489" dur="5.401">respected president when it launched</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="6.5">though unsuccessfully a missile today</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="7.68">bad and we can see this is a coming from</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="7.24">South Korea&amp;#39;s Yonhap news and they</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="5.759">reported that North Korea provoked Trump</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="6.99">with yet another ballistic missile test</text>
  <text start="151.329" dur="6.271">loans and we see right now that a lot of</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="5.099">this information that is coming out of</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="7.139">South Korea coming out of the corporate</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="6.661">media this is all propaganda and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.739" dur="5.451">feeding this war mongering and trying to</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="7.29">get us to war now we know the deep state</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="6.579">central bankers the neocons they have</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="3.57">been trying to get us to war for quite a</text>
  <text start="176.769" dur="3.33">while and it seems that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="2.56">continually pushing their agenda right</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="2.831">now</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="3.72">and we see right now that a lot of</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="5.25">things are happening all at once and</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="5.16">this missile that was launched flew for</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="3.96">several minutes and then it broke apart</text>
  <text start="189.92" dur="5.34">there was no nuclear warhead on top</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="5.429">whatsoever and we see that Tillerson he</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="5.819">was in the United Nations talking about</text>
  <text start="197.569" dur="5.551">what was going on and we need to really</text>
  <text start="201.079" dur="5.25">look at this because I said this going</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="5.399">back quite a while where there&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="206.329" dur="5.761">been really any proof whatsoever that</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="5.701">first of all North Korea was detonating</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="4.59">nuclear weapons because when we had that</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="3.689">earthquake going back sometime the</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="2.94">United States was out there this was</text>
  <text start="217.909" dur="3.211">when Obama was president they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="3.179">that yes North Korea just tested a</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="3.81">nuclear weapon on the ground in Japan</text>
  <text start="222.799" dur="3.81">Russia China they didn&amp;#39;t pick up any</text>
  <text start="224.93" dur="3.869">radiation signatures or anything like</text>
  <text start="226.609" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past so that was</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="4.77">kind of a head-scratcher right there of</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="5.13">why it didn&amp;#39;t seem real at that point</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="4.081">but the corporate media New York Times</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="3.81">and the rest were all out there saying</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="5.55">that yes North Korea has nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="7.47">and they use words like you know may</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="6.629">would could have nuclear weapons and New</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.489">York Times reporter David E Sanger and</text>
  <text start="249.829" dur="7.38">William Jay broad painted a dire picture</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="7.02">back on April 24 2017 and the dire</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="4.381">picture that they were painting of a</text>
  <text start="259.849" dur="4.32">trump administration forced to react to</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="5.22">the growing and impending doom of North</text>
  <text start="264.169" dur="5.49">Korea nuclear weapons and the headline</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="6.69">was as North Korea speeds its nuclear</text>
  <text start="269.659" dur="5.401">program u.s. fears time will run out now</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="6.06">the front page summary was even more</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="6.539">harrowing and the editors asserted that</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="3.74">there&amp;#39;s dwindling time for the u.s.</text>
  <text start="281.599" dur="6.301">actions to stop North Korea from</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="6.1">assembling hundreds of nukes now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="3.509">out there telling us that they have</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="3.75">these things that they have nuclear</text>
  <text start="291.409" dur="3.211">weapons and they&amp;#39;re testing them and</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to mass-produce</text>
  <text start="294.62" dur="4.74">them they even went as far to say that</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re capable of producing nuclear</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="5.13">bombs every - six or seven weeks and all</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="4.23">of this is being backed up by an</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="5.19">anonymous blob of expert studies and</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="4.79">classified intelligence reports now to</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="4.8">add another red flag singer and broad</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="5.5">qualify it in the very next set</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="4.98">of their article that everything is</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="5.16">impossible to verify which is another</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="5.4">way of saying it&amp;#39;s unverified claim when</text>
  <text start="322.52" dur="3.81">asked on Twitter if he could say who</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="3.24">specifically in the US government is</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="4.02">providing the figure broad did not</text>
  <text start="328.1" dur="3.93">immediately respond and when we look at</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="4.04">this all the sources and all the</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="5.73">information is coming from anonymous</text>
  <text start="334.39" dur="5.8">officials and when asked who these</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="5.88">anonymous experts are or these officials</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="4.95">are well they couldn&amp;#39;t hand over the</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="5.25">information they wouldn&amp;#39;t give the names</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="6.57">and when we look at this if we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="5.55">to believe the corporate media if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="6">going to believe the government they</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="8.61">need to tell us who these individuals</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="8.01">are they need to show proof of how they</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="5.7">came to this conclusion and when they</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t do this well it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="368.75" dur="4.41">believe these individuals and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="3.42">looking at this for quite a while and we</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="3.51">see that the evidence actually points</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="4.17">the opposite way that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="376.67" dur="5.67">really not testing as many nuclear</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="5.88">weapons as they have said now the USS</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="5.34">Carl Vinson and it&amp;#39;s Carrier Strike</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="5.46">Group well they finally arrived at the</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="5.52">coast of the Korean Peninsula now there</text>
  <text start="390.17" dur="5.97">was a lot of different mix-ups that were</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="4.98">going on where the White House and the</text>
  <text start="396.14" dur="4.38">Pentagon were saying that yes they were</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="4.74">you know heading towards the Korean</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="4.95">Peninsula they made a stop at Singapore</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="5.28">then they were having drills off out in</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="5.64">the Philippine Sea and then they finally</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="5.46">made it to North Korea and I think this</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="3.99">was all done on purpose to lead the</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="4.02">corporate media way and everything that</text>
  <text start="415.1" dur="4.8">Trump is doing right now is really</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.88">starting starting to make me believe</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="6.57">that he is planning something that is</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="5.52">completely different than what everybody</text>
  <text start="426.47" dur="5.07">thinks right now now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="4.71">interesting where we can see that the</text>
  <text start="431.54" dur="4.44">deep State is really trying to push this</text>
  <text start="433.79" dur="5.52">very very hard trying to get us into war</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="4.89">because there is a database which is</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="4.2">called the James Martin center for</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="5.88">nonproliferation studies North Korean</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="4.68">missile test database which is the first</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="2.97">database to record flight</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="4.71">test of all missiles launched by North</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="6.99">Korea now when we look at this database</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="6.89">and we can see you know when what</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="6.51">quarter what year they tested the</text>
  <text start="459.79" dur="6.13">missile systems what tests have actually</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="5.25">succeeded what tests have failed we can</text>
  <text start="465.92" dur="4.86">see going back in time and we look at</text>
  <text start="468.47" dur="4.94">these numbers where they&amp;#39;ve had even</text>
  <text start="470.78" dur="6">more missile tests than they have now</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="8.02">back over the years why didn&amp;#39;t they make</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="6.93">it a really big deal back then why only</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="2.97">now is it a big deal it&amp;#39;s not like oh</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="3.9">wait</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="5.07">from 2008 going forward they&amp;#39;ve tested</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="4.17">maybe one missile and now all of a</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="3.75">sudden they tested like five with a</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="4.71">couple maybe two or three that have</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="7.14">failed now during the past they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="6.84">tested in one year you know 20 25 28</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.38">missile tests and we didn&amp;#39;t hear that oh</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="4.41">my god North Korea is coming to get us</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="5.28">so this right there shows us that the</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="6.15">deep state they&amp;#39;re pushing an agenda</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="5.64">right now to get us into war now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="4.38">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="515.66" dur="4.62">that we know that Trump had a hundred</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="3.48">senators come to the White House he</text>
  <text start="520.28" dur="2.759">stayed there for about 40 minutes but</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="4.35">the meeting did last a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="5.071">than that about an hour or so and they</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="4.38">talked about certain things in the</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="5.19">meeting Jim mattis was there</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="5.31">he&amp;#39;s the defense secretary Secretary of</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="4.29">State Rex Tillerson was there Director</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="4.98">of National Intelligence dan coates was</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="5.52">there general Joseph Joseph Dunford was</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="4.08">there and they were all talking and</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="2.25">briefing the Senators the details of</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="2.7">that meeting</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.2">well they&amp;#39;ve not really been made public</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="4.86">because there&amp;#39;s classification and</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="5.79">sensitivity in that meeting which is</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="5.64">understandable now here is where it gets</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="5.58">really interesting for months the media</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="6.15">have it random ridiculed Trump for not</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="6.42">distancing himself from President</text>

  <text start="734.95" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re going to discuss what is</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="6.66">happening now Priebus is out there and</text>
  <text start="740.59" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s defending Duterte because the press</text>
  <text start="743.62" dur="5.04">is out there saying that you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="745.51" dur="5.19">violating people&amp;#39;s right out in the</text>

  <text start="754.48" dur="5.79">deep State the central bank is saying</text>
  <text start="756.46" dur="7.2">this because he is going after the CIA</text>

  <text start="769.9" dur="5.58">what that does not sit right with them</text>
  <text start="772.33" dur="4.98">and this is why they are confused in</text>
  <text start="775.48" dur="4.2">what is going on now Priebus is out</text>
  <text start="777.31" dur="5.31">there saying that no no we still care</text>
  <text start="779.68" dur="5.28">about the human rights and Trump is</text>
  <text start="782.62" dur="4.68">calling him in to speak to him but I</text>
  <text start="784.96" dur="4.35">think this is a whole completely</text>
  <text start="787.3" dur="4.8">different plan which they have been</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="5.49">strategizing for quite a while right now</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="5.58">because we know do-dirty has been</text>
  <text start="794.8" dur="5.28">cozying up to China China right now has</text>
  <text start="797.68" dur="4.29">three Chinese warships which are heading</text>
  <text start="800.08" dur="3.03">toward the Philippine shores and for the</text>
  <text start="801.97" dur="3.63">first time in a decade</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="5.21">a group of Chinese warships well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="6.63">expected to arrive and dock in the</text>
  <text start="808.32" dur="6.7">Philippines so there&amp;#39;s a huge change</text>
  <text start="812.23" dur="5.91">going on with all the different nations</text>
  <text start="815.02" dur="4.5">surrounding China where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="818.14" dur="3.03">be talking about what is happening in</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="4.7">the South China Sea and talking about</text>
  <text start="821.17" dur="7.89">North Korea then we get the information</text>
  <text start="824.22" dur="8.26">that China and Russia well they&amp;#39;re back</text>
  <text start="829.06" dur="7.5">in China&amp;#39;s call now to stop North Korea</text>
  <text start="832.48" dur="8.82">new tests in exchange for halting the</text>
  <text start="836.56" dur="6.63">u.s. South Korea drills and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="841.3" dur="5.07">saying listen let&amp;#39;s have a discussion</text>
  <text start="843.19" dur="4.77">about all of this let&amp;#39;s talk about what</text>
  <text start="846.37" dur="4.89">is going on</text>
  <text start="847.96" dur="7.74">if the u.s. stops the drills and stops</text>
  <text start="851.26" dur="6.03">the provocations at North Korea that</text>
  <text start="855.7" dur="4.2">when then would have to stop their</text>
  <text start="857.29" dur="5.01">nuclear program and developing these</text>
  <text start="859.9" dur="3.66">nuclear weapons which first of all we</text>
  <text start="862.3" dur="2.97">have no proof that they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="863.56" dur="3.21">really doing this because all the</text>
  <text start="865.27" dur="3.15">sources and all the data and everything</text>
  <text start="866.77" dur="4.98">that they&amp;#39;re providing doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="868.42" dur="5.55">show it and it looks like something is</text>
  <text start="871.75" dur="4.65">happening right now now the deep state</text>
  <text start="873.97" dur="3.66">what are they going to do and what move</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="3.09">are they going to make well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="3.15">whole different story because we know</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now</text>
  <text start="880.78" dur="6.6">what&amp;#39;s very surprising about this kim</text>
  <text start="883.9" dur="5.37">jeong-hoon last year and this year have</text>
  <text start="887.38" dur="4.23">been reaching out saying we would like</text>
  <text start="889.27" dur="5.22">to talk about this actually North Korea</text>
  <text start="891.61" dur="5.91">came up with this idea that listen we</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="6.23">will stop our nuclear testing if you</text>
  <text start="897.52" dur="5.4">stop these provocations these drills and</text>
  <text start="900.72" dur="3.88">the United States government the central</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="3.78">bankers the deep state didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="904.6" dur="3.75">have anything to do with this and now we</text>
  <text start="906.7" dur="4.47">see that Russia and North Korea and</text>
  <text start="908.35" dur="5.22">China they&amp;#39;re taking this approach which</text>
  <text start="911.17" dur="5.61">is very interesting so we can see the</text>
  <text start="913.57" dur="5.67">strategy is completely changing and we</text>
  <text start="916.78" dur="6.39">can see that Trump is now speaking to</text>
  <text start="919.24" dur="6.21">do-dirty who is basically going after</text>
  <text start="923.17" dur="4.17">the CIA drug running in his country</text>
  <text start="925.45" dur="4.92">getting rid of the central banking</text>
  <text start="927.34" dur="6.36">system and we know in North Korea that</text>
  <text start="930.37" dur="4.98">is competition for the drug-running that</text>
  <text start="933.7" dur="4.35">they have going on in Afghanistan I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="935.35" dur="6.45">talking about the CIA so we can see that</text>
  <text start="938.05" dur="6.6">things are changing a little bit here</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="5.22">and the strategy is completely different</text>
  <text start="944.65" dur="5.7">than what everyone really thinks it is</text>
  <text start="947.02" dur="6.75">now something else very interesting that</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="6">occurred here north Korea has accused</text>
  <text start="953.77" dur="5.49">Israel of being the only illegal</text>
  <text start="956.35" dur="3.75">possessor of nukes and threats to peace</text>
  <text start="959.26" dur="3.39">in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="960.1" dur="4.89">now the reason North Korea came out with</text>
  <text start="962.65" dur="4.47">the statement is because the Israeli</text>
  <text start="964.99" dur="3.6">defense minister says North Korea seems</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="4.32">to have crossed a red line with its</text>
  <text start="968.59" dur="5.19">recent nuclear tests now North Korea</text>
  <text start="971.44" dur="4.92">decided to fire back saying that Israel</text>
  <text start="973.78" dur="5.04">is really the disturber of peace in its</text>
  <text start="976.36" dur="4.089">neighborhood and it&amp;#39;s the one of the</text>
  <text start="978.82" dur="4.9">only countries that</text>
  <text start="980.449" dur="6.39">has nuclear weapons and they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="983.72" dur="6.899">it a secret but is it really a secret</text>
  <text start="986.839" dur="6.42">because back in March of 2015 this is</text>
  <text start="990.619" dur="4.41">coming from the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="993.259" dur="4.711">which released a secret report done in</text>
  <text start="995.029" dur="4.86">1987 by the Pentagon funded Institute</text>
  <text start="997.97" dur="4.649">for Defense analysis that essentially</text>
  <text start="999.889" dur="4.8">confirms the existence of Israeli nukes</text>
  <text start="1002.619" dur="3.541">now the Department of Defense was</text>
  <text start="1004.689" dur="3.92">responding to a Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="1006.16" dur="4.529">lawsuit filed by Grant Smith</text>
  <text start="1008.609" dur="4.21">investigative reporter and author who</text>
  <text start="1010.689" dur="4.92">heads the Institute for Research Middle</text>
  <text start="1012.819" dur="4.8">East policy Smith said he thinks this is</text>
  <text start="1015.609" dur="4.95">the first time the US government has</text>
  <text start="1017.619" dur="6.42">ever provided official recognition of a</text>
  <text start="1020.559" dur="6.62">long-standing reality that Israel does</text>
  <text start="1024.039" dur="6.36">have nuclear weapons so we can see that</text>
  <text start="1027.179" dur="6.73">things are actually changing in this</text>
  <text start="1030.399" dur="6.54">arena that strategy is changing because</text>
  <text start="1033.909" dur="5.04">if North Korea is testing nuclear</text>
  <text start="1036.939" dur="4.291">weapons illegally and the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1038.949" dur="5.041">report that came out says that Israel</text>
  <text start="1041.23" dur="4.349">has nuclear weapons basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1043.99" dur="4.14">saying well maybe we should check into</text>
  <text start="1045.579" dur="5.94">Israel to see what they actually do have</text>
  <text start="1048.13" dur="5.22">because the Pentagon did admit to it so</text>
  <text start="1051.519" dur="3.451">we can see right now that Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1053.35" dur="2.88">pointing the finger at North Korea</text>
  <text start="1054.97" dur="3.419">saying that they have nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1056.23" dur="3.6">and they&amp;#39;re developing them North Korea</text>
  <text start="1058.389" dur="3.211">is pointing the finger at Israel saying</text>
  <text start="1059.83" dur="3.93">that they happy legal nukes which is</text>
  <text start="1061.6" dur="4.65">backed up by the Pentagon Papers so we</text>
  <text start="1063.76" dur="5.73">can see that things are rapidly changing</text>
  <text start="1066.25" dur="5.399">in this entire area now the u.s. they</text>
  <text start="1069.49" dur="5.069">have deployed troops in northeastern</text>
  <text start="1071.649" dur="5.76">Syria as a buffer between the Kurds and</text>
  <text start="1074.559" dur="5.941">Turkey and we see right now that the US</text>
  <text start="1077.409" dur="5.13">has been using the Kurds all along to</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="5.01">carve out certain portions of Syria</text>
  <text start="1082.539" dur="5.821">Turkey does not want the Kurds to have</text>
  <text start="1085.51" dur="5.19">this area they want Assad gone and a lot</text>
  <text start="1088.36" dur="5.01">of these things have been in flux right</text>
  <text start="1090.7" dur="5.01">now and things are starting to rapidly</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="4.649">deteriorate in this area now Lavrov came</text>
  <text start="1095.71" dur="5.219">out and said listen and he came up with</text>
  <text start="1098.019" dur="5.671">this very simple beautiful idea let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1100.929" dur="5.911">not allow the insane world Hawks to drag</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="4.939">the world into open conflict wars are</text>
  <text start="1106.84" dur="4.289">not unleashed by generals but by</text>
  <text start="1108.629" dur="5.351">politicians I would add on to that</text>
  <text start="1111.129" dur="3.181">central bank&amp;#39;s he also warned that war</text>
  <text start="1113.98" dur="2.25">hall</text>
  <text start="1114.31" dur="3.78">are attempting to provoke escalation in</text>
  <text start="1116.23" dur="5.4">Ukraine we are ready to work together</text>
  <text start="1118.09" dur="6.09">jointly search for various options to</text>
  <text start="1121.63" dur="4.2">overcome our challenges on the basis of</text>
  <text start="1124.18" dur="3.93">equality mutual respect and</text>
  <text start="1125.83" dur="4.8">consideration for each other&amp;#39;s interests</text>
  <text start="1128.11" dur="5.34">weird all our partners to do this and we</text>
  <text start="1130.63" dur="6.87">are urging other countries to work with</text>
  <text start="1133.45" dur="7.95">us to go after terrorism to go after the</text>
  <text start="1137.5" dur="6.27">terrorists in Syria now is the West</text>
  <text start="1141.4" dur="4.29">listening will they respond to this they</text>
  <text start="1143.77" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t in the past and if the deep</text>
  <text start="1145.69" dur="4.44">state keeps control they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1147.64" dur="5.91">continually push their goal to separate</text>
  <text start="1150.13" dur="5.46">Syria get us into war and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1153.55" dur="4.65">have to watch this situation to see how</text>
  <text start="1155.59" dur="4.47">this plays out now something very</text>
  <text start="1158.2" dur="2.25">interesting which we kind of knew all</text>
  <text start="1160.06" dur="2.91">along</text>
  <text start="1160.45" dur="5.4">where the United States the coalition</text>
  <text start="1162.97" dur="4.47">forces Israel they&amp;#39;re all part of the</text>
  <text start="1165.85" dur="4.53">Islamic state because something very</text>
  <text start="1167.44" dur="5.97">interesting did happen this came out of</text>
  <text start="1170.38" dur="6.72">the Times of Israel where the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1173.41" dur="6.84">state terrorist group have apologized to</text>
  <text start="1177.1" dur="5.55">Israel for mistakenly attacking IDF</text>
  <text start="1180.25" dur="5.73">soldiers in the occupied Golan Heights</text>
  <text start="1182.65" dur="6.03">why with the terrorist group apologized</text>
  <text start="1185.98" dur="6.95">to Israel this makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1188.68" dur="7.44">unless Israel supports the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1192.93" dur="4.96">unless the United States supports the</text>
  <text start="1196.12" dur="5.07">Islamic state and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1197.89" dur="6">support Islamic state this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1201.19" dur="6.39">what has been happening</text>
  <text start="1203.89" dur="6.84">they created them they support them they</text>
  <text start="1207.58" dur="6.96">fund them and we can see these are the</text>
  <text start="1210.73" dur="6.33">terrorist groups that they use to push</text>
  <text start="1214.54" dur="5.46">their agenda throughout the world now</text>
  <text start="1217.06" dur="5.22">where did this apology come from how do</text>
  <text start="1220" dur="5.52">we know about it well this came from</text>
  <text start="1222.28" dur="5.73">Ilan when he was giving an interview for</text>
  <text start="1225.52" dur="5.01">The Times of Israel where he said there</text>
  <text start="1228.01" dur="5.79">was one case recently where the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1230.53" dur="6.66">state opened fired and then apologized</text>
  <text start="1233.8" dur="5.16">so we see right now that everything that</text>
  <text start="1237.19" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about everything that</text>
  <text start="1238.96" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ve been saying is all coming true</text>
  <text start="1241.9" dur="4.96">this is like one gigantic truth bomb</text>
  <text start="1243.88" dur="5.44">that has been put out there</text>
  <text start="1246.86" dur="5.55">and we see that the strategy with North</text>
  <text start="1249.32" dur="6.18">Korea the strategy with Syria well this</text>
  <text start="1252.41" dur="4.44">could be changing in the near future</text>
  <text start="1255.5" dur="3.9">because we need to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="1256.85" dur="5.19">with do-dirty what&amp;#39;s going on with North</text>
  <text start="1259.4" dur="4.68">Korea because I do believe there are the</text>
  <text start="1262.04" dur="4.44">factions of deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="1264.08" dur="6.15">the neocons and those other individuals</text>
  <text start="1266.48" dur="7.29">in government who are fighting against</text>
  <text start="1270.23" dur="9.17">these I guess bad guys where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1273.77" dur="8.159">trying to maneuver away to avert a war</text>
  <text start="1279.4" dur="5.11">where the deep state wants us to get</text>
  <text start="1281.929" dur="4.771">into a war and there&amp;#39;s this battle going</text>
  <text start="1284.51" dur="5.159">on and we can see what do-dirty a well</text>
  <text start="1286.7" dur="4.32">he is going after the central bank he is</text>
