  <text start="83.799" dur="4.981">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="85.96" dur="7.589">geopolitical news now at this point we</text>
  <text start="88.78" dur="9.06">realize that obama vetoed the 911 bill</text>
  <text start="93.549" dur="8.761">which allowed US citizens to sue Saudi</text>
  <text start="97.84" dur="10.68">Arabia then Congress rejected the veto</text>
  <text start="102.31" dur="10.049">and we can see that Saudi Arabia has</text>
  <text start="108.52" dur="6.23">been talking about retaliation against</text>
  <text start="112.359" dur="7.021">the United States for doing this and</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="7.329">they might sell their US assets they</text>
  <text start="119.38" dur="5.19">might sell their US Treasuries right now</text>
  <text start="122.079" dur="4.051">Saudi Arabia they came out and they said</text>
  <text start="124.57" dur="5.49">they rejected the congressional approval</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="6.63">of the Act that would allow families of</text>
  <text start="130.06" dur="5.7">victims of the 911 attacks to sue Saudi</text>
  <text start="132.76" dur="5.79">Arabia claiming it weakens the sovereign</text>
  <text start="135.76" dur="5.21">immunity of the nation Russia has also</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="6.45">come out and slammed the legislation as</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="8.65">undermining international law and we can</text>
  <text start="145" dur="9.02">see right now that this was set up this</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="7.5">was created so the people would force</text>
  <text start="154.02" dur="6.52">the administration to do this because we</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="6.69">can see many pieces now are coming into</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="6.27">play or are being connected together</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="6.84">because we have Saudi Arabia that is on</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="6.45">the verge of selling us assets selling</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="9.66">Treasury bonds that would be most likely</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="10.44">their next move we also see the wars out</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="7.5">in the Middle East where the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="6.71">is threatened we also see one of the</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="5.07">largest banks Deutsche Bank is</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="4.75">collapsing which would start off a chain</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="5.04">reaction and the central bankers knew</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="4.68">that they can only hold the system</text>
  <text start="197.92" dur="3.78">together for a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="3.72">before something actually started to</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="4.319">fall apart and they knew Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="4.679">was going to go I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="206.019" dur="4.351">talking about this for quite a while so</text>
  <text start="208.239" dur="4.171">they needed to do something and I</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="4.979">believe this is what they did with Saudi</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="6.21">Arabia this way they can create this</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="5.281">instance of yes Saudi Arabia started</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="4.92">selling assets they started bringing</text>
  <text start="220.63" dur="5.43">down the economy it was because of you</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.89">the people it triggered deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="5.519">and we can see right now how this is all</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="4.71">going to play into it and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="3.75">have to watch this entire situation</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="4.05">carefully because we can see that</text>
  <text start="235.329" dur="3.841">there&amp;#39;s other pieces to the puzzle that</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="4.2">are coming in because we see the petro</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="5.129">dollar is under threat right now in the</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="5.48">Middle East and everything is starting</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="7.321">to fall apart it&amp;#39;s like a perfect storm</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="6.64">plus we have the elections coming up so</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="5.33">this whole thing is going to be a</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="6.81">complete mess and put on top of that</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="6.37">tomorrow is when they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="6.48">the hand off of the Internet to the UN</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="5.01">now so far Congress has done nothing we</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="5.04">see there are four states that are going</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="5.82">to sue to block Obama&amp;#39;s internet</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="4.74">transition set for tomorrow night but</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.34">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what happens remember</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="3.959">to set up a world one world government</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="3.25">it&amp;#39;s not that they&amp;#39;re setting up a</text>
  <text start="280.539" dur="3.6">government where they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="4.35">you know the central banker sitting</text>
  <text start="284.139" dur="6.691">there in a big chair going I rule all of</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="6.9">you all they need to do is override the</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="4.649">governments of each country&amp;#39;s laws and</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="4.32">all they need to do is say whatever we</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="3.481">say goes</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="4.5">we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to do this</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="5.97">with many different pieces hand the</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="6.68">internet over to the UN the UN controls</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="8.58">many nations controls the entire</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="9.15">internet whatever they say goes have the</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="9.3">TPP the TTIP signed by all the countries</text>
  <text start="317.64" dur="9.4">where they create this corporate court</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="10.17">system where the laws of that court</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="8.69">system override the government&amp;#39;s laws so</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="6.69">you can see how they can set this up</text>
  <text start="335.73" dur="7.74">under the radar and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="339.67" dur="6.05">they&amp;#39;re doing at the same time</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="6.82">everything&amp;#39;s starting to collapse around</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="6.25">now the TTP the TTIP the TPP it looks</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="3.54">like that&amp;#39;s dead in the water but</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="3.57">remember just because something is not</text>
  <text start="353.83" dur="4.17">being pushed through doesn&amp;#39;t mean they</text>
  <text start="355.54" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t keep trying because we can see</text>
  <text start="358" dur="7.61">right now Canada has their version it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="7.53">like the back-up plan for the TTIP and</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="4.51">when you&amp;#39;re watching this you can see</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="6.21">that the European countries they might</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="5.49">sign that and they will get their way</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="4.65">and I&amp;#39;m talking about they the US</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="6.63">government central bankers the elite who</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="6.66">want this one world government and for</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="5.15">those people who wonder you know what</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="5.79">the elite actually think of the people</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="7.12">well there was a new survey of America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="5.9">unelected governing elites by political</text>
  <text start="394.51" dur="5.1">scientists at John Hopkins University</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="7.21">federal bureaucrats think-tank leaders</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="8.43">and others that they surveyed think</text>
  <text start="404.26" dur="7.47">Americans are stupid and should do what</text>
  <text start="408.04" dur="6.69">they are told so when people are out</text>
  <text start="411.73" dur="6.21">there saying oh you&amp;#39;re a sheep you</text>
  <text start="414.73" dur="6.54">this is exactly what they want they want</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="9.26">a herd of people this is what they think</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="8.699">of all of us we&amp;#39;re a nuisance we have to</text>
  <text start="427.2" dur="7.419">take the herd thin</text>
  <text start="429.969" dur="6.24">out how do we do that with war we need</text>
  <text start="434.619" dur="4.26">to take away the rights of the herd</text>
  <text start="436.209" dur="4.2">because with rights they won&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="438.879" dur="6.39">we want so this is why you see them</text>
  <text start="440.409" dur="6.92">trying to train the next generation to</text>
  <text start="445.269" dur="3.93">make them believe they don&amp;#39;t have rights</text>
  <text start="447.329" dur="5.8">this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="6.96">violating our rights because they look</text>
  <text start="453.129" dur="7.53">at us and they say yeah just another</text>

  <text start="528.069" dur="6">throughout the corporate media they are</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="7.279">using the propaganda at full speed right</text>

  <text start="537.899" dur="3.67">they&amp;#39;re going to be hitting them hard</text>
  <text start="540.04" dur="3.63">because what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="541.569" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going to demonize them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="8.76">going to make them look like a crazy man</text>
  <text start="544.959" dur="11.55">and then they&amp;#39;re going to have a regime</text>

  <text start="581.499" dur="6.84">encircles China and they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="584.049" dur="6.84">lose this strategic area we see the UN</text>
  <text start="588.339" dur="6.12">is out there condemning the killing of</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="6.09">15 civilians in Afghanistan the US used</text>

  <text start="919.77" dur="6.12">this strategic area Syria is saying that</text>
  <text start="924.3" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re ready to cooperate with the UN</text>
  <text start="925.89" dur="4.5">to provide humanitarian aid to the</text>

  <text start="942.02" dur="7.09">hampering the efforts to bring in the</text>
  <text start="945.45" dur="7.47">humanitarian aid so what did the United</text>
  <text start="949.11" dur="7.98">States do well the United States flew in</text>
  <text start="952.92" dur="7.8">and destroyed infrastructure inside of</text>
  <text start="957.09" dur="7.65">Syria they destroyed a pair of bridges</text>
  <text start="960.72" dur="7.2">in the Eastern Deir Ezzor province</text>
  <text start="964.74" dur="4.02">and Syria is saying well what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="967.92" dur="5.13">here you&amp;#39;re destroying our</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="7.98">infrastructure here well when they</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="5.49">destroyed the bridges that will impede</text>
  <text start="976.74" dur="3.75">humanitarian aid deliveries into the</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="4.02">area it would hamper the movement of</text>
  <text start="980.49" dur="5.849">civilians trying to flee combat areas in</text>
  <text start="982.56" dur="6.839">the province and basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.339" dur="7.831">separating the areas right now trying to</text>
  <text start="989.399" dur="6.331">control the situation the United States</text>
  <text start="994.17" dur="4.26">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="995.73" dur="5.669">desperate this is why Russia right now</text>
  <text start="998.43" dur="4.65">realizes that this desperate country</text>
  <text start="1001.399" dur="5.671">this nut country has to say the</text>
  <text start="1003.08" dur="6.47">desperate government the neocons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.07" dur="5.43">going to do whatever they have to do to</text>
  <text start="1009.55" dur="6.28">fight back this is why Russia right now</text>
  <text start="1012.5" dur="6.18">is sending in more bombers to an airbase</text>
  <text start="1015.83" dur="7.35">in Latakia they&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>
  <text start="1018.68" dur="8.34">su-24 s su-34 s we know their aircraft</text>
  <text start="1023.18" dur="6.149">carrier is off the coast of Syria and we</text>
  <text start="1027.02" dur="5.819">realize right now that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1029.329" dur="5.431">getting prepared for war and the time</text>
  <text start="1032.839" dur="6.35">has come for the United States to make a</text>
  <text start="1034.76" dur="10.25">choice continue negotiations with Russia</text>
  <text start="1039.189" dur="8.921">or start a war and we know that</text>
  <text start="1045.01" dur="5.56">negotiations aren&amp;#39;t going well and we</text>
  <text start="1048.11" dur="4.41">can see they decided to make war right</text>
  <text start="1050.57" dur="5.01">now unless something dramatically</text>
  <text start="1052.52" dur="6.18">changes we are on the path to world war</text>
  <text start="1055.58" dur="6.09">three so the u.s. is going to be setting</text>
  <text start="1058.7" dur="5.04">a lot more weapons to the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1061.67" dur="6.18">groups which we have been seeing manpads</text>
  <text start="1063.74" dur="6.42">grad rockets toes javelins now the</text>
  <text start="1067.85" dur="3.8">effect of these weapons well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1070.16" dur="4.53">going to really help out because</text>
  <text start="1071.65" dur="5.56">Russians their fixed-wing aircraft fly</text>
  <text start="1074.69" dur="4.59">over 5,000 meters and they&amp;#39;re out of the</text>
  <text start="1077.21" dur="3.45">reach of the man pads so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1079.28" dur="3.6">to have to bring in more advanced</text>
  <text start="1080.66" dur="4.86">weaponry once we see more advanced</text>
  <text start="1082.88" dur="5.91">weaponry coming in we know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1085.52" dur="5.49">game on at this point but we have to</text>
  <text start="1088.79" dur="5.639">look at the situation right now and we</text>
  <text start="1091.01" dur="6.21">have to realize that the u.s. is going</text>
  <text start="1094.429" dur="3.781">to have a very tough time in Syria</text>
  <text start="1097.22" dur="5.09">because</text>
  <text start="1098.21" dur="8.21">can send more t90 tanks and the toes</text>
  <text start="1102.31" dur="9.28">don&amp;#39;t have any effect on them whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1106.42" dur="9.25">we know that the u.s. they might try to</text>
  <text start="1111.59" dur="6.18">create a no-fly zone this is going to be</text>
  <text start="1115.67" dur="6.78">a problem now a safe zone is completely</text>
  <text start="1117.77" dur="8.81">different a no-fly zone what they would</text>
  <text start="1122.45" dur="6.74">have to do is they would have to bomb</text>
  <text start="1126.58" dur="6.1">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1129.19" dur="7.12">the enemy&amp;#39;s air defenses command and</text>
  <text start="1132.68" dur="6.6">control capabilities they would have to</text>
  <text start="1136.31" dur="7.14">use heavy jamming and anti-radiation</text>
  <text start="1139.28" dur="7.26">missile strikes and they would have to</text>
  <text start="1143.45" dur="7.29">achieve all of this with a tactical</text>
  <text start="1146.54" dur="6.21">surprise they would have to hit the</text>
  <text start="1150.74" dur="5.16">enemy air bases where their planes are</text>
  <text start="1152.75" dur="7.71">on the ground and they can&amp;#39;t use the air</text>
  <text start="1155.9" dur="6.6">bases anymore and if they do this this</text>
  <text start="1160.46" dur="5.88">phase would last about forty eight to</text>
  <text start="1162.5" dur="7.2">ten 48 hours to ten days but we have to</text>
  <text start="1166.34" dur="9.06">remember something very important this</text>
  <text start="1169.7" dur="11.97">is not Libya Iraq Lebanon this is Syria</text>
  <text start="1175.4" dur="10.02">with Russia remember the s-300 the s400</text>
  <text start="1181.67" dur="7.56">systems there in Syria the US has never</text>
  <text start="1185.42" dur="6.48">had to operate against them especially</text>
  <text start="1189.23" dur="7.11">against the Russian version of these</text>
  <text start="1191.9" dur="10.26">type of weapons also Russia they have</text>
  <text start="1196.34" dur="11.63">very long range radars the US has a wax</text>
  <text start="1202.16" dur="10.05">which could be used but the Russians</text>
  <text start="1207.97" dur="7.18">would deploy their anti AWACS very long</text>
  <text start="1212.21" dur="5.82">range missiles and hit him out of the</text>
  <text start="1215.15" dur="5.94">sky now we know NATO is bringing in the</text>
  <text start="1218.03" dur="8.13">AWACS plane so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1221.09" dur="9.91">preparing to go all out here to go with</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="7.57">this no-fly zone type of plan and Russia</text>
  <text start="1231" dur="5.43">would deploy their own a wax but they</text>
  <text start="1233.73" dur="4.8">would put them in Iranian airspace and</text>
  <text start="1236.43" dur="5.7">remember the Iranians don&amp;#39;t they have</text>
  <text start="1238.53" dur="9.33">the s400 right now they would protect</text>
  <text start="1242.13" dur="8.79">these a wax with also mig-31 BMS making</text>
  <text start="1247.86" dur="7.26">making them very difficult targets so</text>
  <text start="1250.92" dur="6.99">for the u.s. to do all this it would be</text>
  <text start="1255.12" dur="7.2">a complete disaster it would be war with</text>
  <text start="1257.91" dur="5.97">Russia because think about this yes they</text>
  <text start="1262.32" dur="3.15">were able to do with this with Libya</text>
  <text start="1263.88" dur="4.35">they were able to fly in you know</text>
  <text start="1265.47" dur="7.2">destroy you know their radar system</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="6.39">their air bases with ease this is</text>
  <text start="1272.67" dur="4.05">something completely different because</text>
  <text start="1274.62" dur="5.87">Russia is already bringing in the</text>
  <text start="1276.72" dur="6.96">equipment remember they also have that</text>
  <text start="1280.49" dur="7.27">electronic jamming equipment which just</text>
  <text start="1283.68" dur="8.25">brings everything down so once they use</text>
  <text start="1287.76" dur="6.6">that this entire no-fly zone is going</text>
  <text start="1291.93" dur="4.29">nowhere and we&amp;#39;ve started world war</text>
  <text start="1294.36" dur="3.3">three actually not we the United States</text>
  <text start="1296.22" dur="4.29">government central bankers the crazies</text>
  <text start="1297.66" dur="6.45">in our government started World War</text>
  <text start="1300.51" dur="5.1">three and we know this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1304.11" dur="3.24">they wanted we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="1305.61" dur="3.87">for a very long time we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>

  <text start="1312.42" dur="5.88">recording it saying it and here we are</text>
  <text start="1315.24" dur="7.53">once again now will Russia talk them</text>
  <text start="1318.3" dur="6.54">down will be a ceasefire I don&amp;#39;t know at</text>
  <text start="1322.77" dur="4.5">this point because this has been tried</text>
  <text start="1324.84" dur="6.75">many many times and the United States</text>
  <text start="1327.27" dur="5.61">they can&amp;#39;t stick by it and I think the</text>
  <text start="1331.59" dur="3.93">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1332.88" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re running out of options the</text>
  <text start="1335.52" dur="3.99">system is coming down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="1337.68" dur="4.26">the woods I mean we have Deutsche Bank</text>

  <text start="1341.94" dur="8.04">threat the 911 bill has been passed and</text>
  <text start="1346.85" dur="6.82">it seems like all of this has come</text>
  <text start="1349.98" dur="7.11">together and things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="1353.67" dur="6.47">apart and as the economy continually</text>
  <text start="1357.09" dur="5.79">breaks apart the Tarot rates collapse</text>
  <text start="1360.14" dur="4.96">collapses they&amp;#39;re going to push this war</text>
  <text start="1362.88" dur="5.19">even harder so one way here</text>
  <text start="1365.1" dur="5.13">more advanced weapons coming into Syria</text>
  <text start="1368.07" dur="4.44">when we hear the propaganda and the</text>
  <text start="1370.23" dur="5.55">corporate media talking about no-fly</text>
  <text start="1372.51" dur="6.84">zones and things like that we know at</text>
  <text start="1375.78" dur="7.43">this point we are headed for World War</text>
