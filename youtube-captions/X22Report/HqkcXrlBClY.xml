  <text start="27.859" dur="5.441">hi welcome to the x 22 report my name is</text>
  <text start="30.84" dur="6.359">dave and this is episode 213 and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="6.359">state is november 12 2013 and the title</text>
  <text start="37.199" dur="4.951">of this episode is is the economy really</text>
  <text start="39.659" dur="4.201">collapsing let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="42.15" dur="4.88">economic collapse news and what we are</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="5.939">seeing is Fitch decided to downgrade</text>
  <text start="47.03" dur="5.86">Chicago right now and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="49.799" dur="5.101">that their liabilities are six hundred</text>
  <text start="52.89" dur="4.949">and seventy eight percent of its revenue</text>
  <text start="54.9" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re also saying that eight billion</text>
  <text start="57.839" dur="6.36">in Chicago&amp;#39;s unlimited tax general</text>
  <text start="60.119" dur="8.071">obligation bonds to a from a a minus</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="7.251">Fitch also cut 497 million sales tax</text>
  <text start="68.19" dur="5.7">bonds to a minus from a a minus and</text>
  <text start="71.45" dur="5.65">downgraded 200 million commercial paper</text>
  <text start="73.89" dur="6.36">notes and the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="6.72">of the poor American economic landscape</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="7.229">high unemployment and property tax base</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="5.609">recovery has been elusive and we are</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="4.411">seeing this happen in every single city</text>
  <text start="89.429" dur="4.8">we saw it happen in Detroit and Detroit</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="3.81">finally went bankrupt we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="4.291">in many different cities in a couple of</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="5.339">reports as I did before I listed down</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="6.089">all the cities that do not have any type</text>
  <text start="101.039" dur="6.57">of cash reserve and I also reported on</text>
  <text start="104.609" dur="4.47">many of the cities are spending a lot</text>
  <text start="107.609" dur="2.61">more than they&amp;#39;re bringing in and of</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="3.33">course that sounds like the US</text>
  <text start="110.219" dur="4.771">government where they&amp;#39;re not bringing in</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="4.471">that much revenue to support the debt</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="4.409">that they&amp;#39;re putting on and we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="6.269">this happen in many of the cities and we</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="6.061">can understand why these cities are</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="5.071">taken on draconian laws like New York</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="6.47">for instance taking the laws to stop and</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="6.599">frisk people and to and they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="5.559">creating gun laws to make it very</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="5.161">difficult for people to get weapons and</text>
  <text start="137.489" dur="3.601">we are seeing this happen along the east</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="4.32">coast we&amp;#39;re seeing a new</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="6.41">Jersey New York Connecticut Maryland all</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="6.049">the populated areas California Colorado</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="5.56">Illinois we&amp;#39;re seeing this all over it</text>
  <text start="150.349" dur="5.47">these areas because these are the very</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="5.88">heavy populated areas and even in Jersey</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="7.021">we see them they created a draconian gun</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="6.48">law where it will check you first on the</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="4.709">TSA list to see if you&amp;#39;re some type of</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="5.61">terrorists and if you&amp;#39;re on that list</text>
  <text start="167.549" dur="5.16">you can&amp;#39;t get a gun permit and the funny</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="2.97">thing is you don&amp;#39;t know how you got on</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="2.461">the list you don&amp;#39;t know how to get off</text>
  <text start="174" dur="3.989">the listen you&amp;#39;re not allowed to see the</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="6.06">list so it makes no sense whatsoever at</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="7.59">this time now I talked a lot about real</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="6.63">estate and how real estate is in a</text>
  <text start="185.579" dur="3.811">bubble and we all understand this we</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="4.349">understand that the Fed is still pumping</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="5.22">in billions of dollars to buy this real</text>
  <text start="192.209" dur="4.411">estate from the banks the banks are</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="4.26">taking that money pumping up the stock</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="5.55">market and this is what this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="6.739">happening right now in my past reports I</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="6.81">also described many different indicators</text>
  <text start="205.609" dur="5.88">back in August September we saw that</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="5.43">mortgage applications for declining and</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="6.131">we saw that most of the sales were in</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="5.699">cash from huge investment companies</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="6.179">hedge funds and things like that and</text>
  <text start="220.109" dur="5.94">what we are seeing now is that sales are</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="4.651">starting to decline we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="5.401">pending sales are climbing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="7.369">actually saying now new home builders</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="10.23">are reporting that people are cancelling</text>
  <text start="235.819" dur="12.73">their homes at this time and what we are</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="9.209">seeing is that DR Horton has reported</text>
  <text start="248.549" dur="5.27">that the cancellation rate has</text>
  <text start="250.889" dur="5.16">skyrocketed to about thirty one percent</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="5.26">which they only expected about a</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="6.481">25-percent cancellation rate but it has</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="7.411">gone up dramatically at this time and</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="6.15">you know what we are seeing is if we</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="5.64">look back in time that mortgage</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="5.22">applications took a dive and we always</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="4.98">know that the sales</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="5.64">and what we are seeing is the sales now</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="4.49">that are coming in people are starting</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="4.74">to cancel people are not taking</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="5.17">mortgages out the pending sales are</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="5.16">dropping and we are moving into a very</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="5.399">slow time for housing and we can see</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="6.509">that the bubble is now pretty much</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="5.881">coming apart and the major investors are</text>
  <text start="295.949" dur="4.261">looking to get out of the housing market</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="5.07">now does this happen every single place</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.61">the same way at the same time no it</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t we see this differently in each</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="5.4">state even down to the city and even</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.699">down into the counties it depends where</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="7.38">you are where you live but eventually it</text>
  <text start="313.979" dur="6.091">all catches up with everyone and I can</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="4.26">remember back and I&amp;#39;ve repeated this</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="6.96">story before when I was living in New</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="6.119">York trying to sell my home you know</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="3.93">traffic completely came to a screeching</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="4.381">halt I mean just two or three months</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.799">before the person next to me who was</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="5.13">selling his home had a busload of people</text>
  <text start="335.759" dur="5.581">sold it in a week I waited three four</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="5.01">months not a single person coming to my</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="3.72">house then I called down the Florida</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="4.289">where my sister-in-law works she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="4.889">realtor and she told us that things are</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="3.63">booming baby I have no idea what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.949" dur="4.831">talking about things are you know</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="6.151">rocking like crazy down here and it took</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="5.4">about six to eight months for this to</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="5.909">appear in Florida and they were hit even</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="5.28">harder than in New York so we will see</text>
  <text start="363.479" dur="4.551">this happen in different places at</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="7.5">different times and we understand this</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="7.419">and we also understand that it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="6.03">difficult for people to purchase homes</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="5.131">that are not working underemployed have</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="4.38">bad credit because their homes were</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="5.88">foreclosed on who have sold their homes</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="6.479">using a short sale and they have no</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="6.12">credit at this time and all these people</text>
  <text start="389.849" dur="6.361">the amount of people that went through</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="6.45">this is quite large because how do we</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="5.79">know this because the banks still have a</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="7.35">lot of shadow inventory on their books</text>
  <text start="402" dur="5.74">the Fed is still pumping in billions and</text>
  <text start="406.38" dur="3.25">billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="407.74" dur="5.82">every month and they want to increase</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="8.45">this a former top fed traitor confesses</text>
  <text start="413.56" dur="8.039">that QE does nothing absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.95">for the economy it does nothing for jobs</text>
  <text start="421.599" dur="5.1">it does nothing for the housing market I</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="6.69">mean in the way that we wanted to happen</text>
  <text start="426.699" dur="8.071">it does absolutely nothing what does QE</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="6.72">do well it makes the bankers and Wall</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="4.92">Street richer it pumps up the stock</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="4.83">market it creates the Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="5.31">bubble it creates the housing bubble it</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="8.84">creates the student loan bubble this is</text>
  <text start="445" dur="10.11">what QE is all about QE is here to rob</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="7.75">pillage take whatever they can from the</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="6">everyday person that&amp;#39;s all this is used</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="4.83">for and we are seeing the great rotation</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="5.399">of retail investors in the stock market</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="6.14">right now where the big guys the</text>
  <text start="466.509" dur="6.271">insiders the big investment houses</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="5.53">understand that the stock market is in a</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="5.97">bubble they are leaving the market and</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="6.089">they are selling their stocks to all the</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="4.32">people who came afterwards who think the</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="5.581">market is going to go much much higher</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="7.11">who eventually will lose everything they</text>
  <text start="487.03" dur="6.509">have and this always happens the same</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="7.41">exact way the stock market right before</text>
  <text start="493.539" dur="7.111">the crash hits all-time new highs the</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="4.889">big guys the insiders get out and the</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="4.62">little guys are left holding it all</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="5.22">watching it completely come tumbling</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="4.56">down and we know this is happening at</text>
  <text start="507.699" dur="4.561">this time so we see many things</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="5.819">happening all at the same time we see</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="5.79">housing market the big investors are</text>
  <text start="515.649" dur="5.041">trying to unload their homes trying to</text>
  <text start="518.05" dur="4.83">get the everyday person to purchase</text>
  <text start="520.69" dur="4.459">these homes and they&amp;#39;re having a tough</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="5.37">time purchasing because guess what if</text>
  <text start="525.149" dur="4.301">youth unemployment is is I mean</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="2.97">according to the government is</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="3.87">twenty-two percent but if you use the</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="4.77">non manipulated numbers it&amp;#39;s closer to</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="5.31">fifty percent and we also had a report</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="4.539">that most of the students who are</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="2.8">graduating college are still</text>
  <text start="540.529" dur="4.17">living with their parents because they</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="6.3">can&amp;#39;t find good jobs we also understand</text>
  <text start="544.699" dur="6">that the government is manipulating and</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="5.13">not manipulating up modifying the</text>
  <text start="550.699" dur="3.45">student loans because they understand a</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="4.32">lot of these students are underwater</text>
  <text start="554.149" dur="4.41">they cannot find jobs in their fields</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="3.36">and they&amp;#39;re making a lot less so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.559" dur="3.63">modifying the payments so it makes it</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="4.14">easier for them and a lot of people a</text>
  <text start="562.189" dur="4.861">lot of these students have no payments</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="4.74">at this time because they understand if</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="4.139">they just let all these student loans go</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="4.079">the whole thing will just come crashing</text>
  <text start="571.189" dur="5.431">down so they&amp;#39;re modifying everyone and</text>
  <text start="573.499" dur="5.88">pretending everything is okay and from</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="5.399">all of that there&amp;#39;s no way that the</text>
  <text start="579.379" dur="5.43">up-and-coming youth are going to be able</text>
  <text start="582.019" dur="6.75">to support the housing market the job</text>
  <text start="584.809" dur="8.97">market the retail market it just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.769" dur="8.82">be done so we see that things are not</text>
  <text start="593.779" dur="7.141">going the way everyone thinks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.589" dur="6.841">going this is not a recovery this we are</text>
  <text start="600.92" dur="6.899">right smack damn in the middle of a</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="6.839">collapse this is the beginning stages of</text>
  <text start="607.819" dur="6.51">it Europe if we look out to Europe we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="617.029" dur="4.381">bit ahead of us here in the States</text>

  <text start="652.519" dur="5.331">ago I reported on citibank and other</text>
  <text start="655.399" dur="5.61">banks wanting pushing this bill forward</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="6.399">where they can move their derivative</text>
  <text start="661.009" dur="5.13">accounts into guaranteed accounts that</text>
  <text start="664.249" dur="3.09">will be guaranteed by the FDIC and we</text>
  <text start="666.139" dur="4.2">all know why they want that to happen</text>
  <text start="667.339" dur="6.43">it&amp;#39;s because they understand when this</text>
  <text start="670.339" dur="5.59">thing comes crumbling down all that</text>
  <text start="673.769" dur="4.68">just going to vaporize and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="675.929" dur="4.44">be a domino effect where derivatives are</text>
  <text start="678.449" dur="4.89">just going to completely collapse and</text>

  <text start="707.759" dur="6">suspension preferably no more than 48</text>
  <text start="710.579" dur="5.85">hours gives resolution officials time to</text>

  <text start="2069.859" dur="7.32">and the whole strike scenario could be</text>
  <text start="2073.48" dur="5.889">ramped up again and they understand that</text>
