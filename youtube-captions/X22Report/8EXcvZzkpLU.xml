  <text start="209.209" dur="5.301">by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Trump</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="6.541">has added more than 6 million jobs</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="7">during his term the same cannot be said</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="7.38">for Obama as during the same time he</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="5.819">lost 2.8 million jobs Obama was so bad</text>
  <text start="225.41" dur="4.22">at creating jobs that by the end of his</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="6.361">second term he said that jobs were not</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="6.4">coming back and there was a video saying</text>
  <text start="233.69" dur="3.54">what what there&amp;#39;s no way he can bring</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="2.819">back these jobs they&amp;#39;re not coming back</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="3.479">to the US what does he have a magic wand</text>
  <text start="238.849" dur="2.82">or something and then Trump responded</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="5.191">yes I do</text>
  <text start="241.669" dur="8.22">have a magic wand and I figured out how</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="7.28">this manipulated system works and now I</text>
  <text start="249.889" dur="6.69">have complete control over this overall</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="6.279">Trump has gained nearly 9 million more</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="6.171">jobs than Obama in their respective</text>
  <text start="259.459" dur="7.231">first two and a half years in office</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="6.25">Trump needs to do this this is why you</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="4.62">see everything going on right now and</text>
  <text start="269" dur="4.62">this is why the globalists the central</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="4.829">bank they don&amp;#39;t like this remember their</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="4.56">entire plan was completely the opposite</text>
  <text start="276.139" dur="4.741">of what Trump is doing I mean really</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="4.98">think back to when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="5.19">and we were battling the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="6.09">in Syria and every time the u.s. bombed</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="5.94">the Islam in in Syria the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="4.469">gained ground and nobody could</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="5.499">understand this how is this possible are</text>
  <text start="293.719" dur="7.141">they just good no this was allowed</text>
  <text start="297.509" dur="6.3">think about the u.s. with the economy</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="5.919">what were they doing they were moving</text>
  <text start="303.809" dur="6.54">everything out of the country this is</text>
  <text start="306.779" dur="5.97">why jobs continually decreased when you</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="4.231">move manufacturers companies and you</text>
  <text start="312.749" dur="4.26">make it very difficult for companies to</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="5.19">operate what happens the whole thing</text>
  <text start="317.009" dur="5.761">doesn&amp;#39;t work now if you add in the</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.759">central bank it&amp;#39;s a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="5.009">disaster and if you add debt on top of</text>
  <text start="325.529" dur="4.95">that forget about it that&amp;#39;s where we are</text>
  <text start="327.779" dur="6.241">today and Trump is reversing all of this</text>
  <text start="330.479" dur="6.99">and they don&amp;#39;t like it Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.699">the following I think President Trump is</text>
  <text start="337.469" dur="4.2">set in his ways because he doesn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="339.719" dur="3.961">any weakening I mean look at the</text>
  <text start="341.669" dur="4.381">joblessness report today when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="4.709">surprised at is how strong the consumer</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="5.459">is I think the Chinese need it a deal</text>
  <text start="348.389" dur="5.221">more than we do it&amp;#39;s statistical I just</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="4.74">think that our economy is very strong if</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="4.829">the Fed with lower rates to where the</text>
  <text start="356.249" dur="4.14">bond market says they should be then I</text>
  <text start="358.439" dur="3.6">really wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about a recession</text>
  <text start="360.389" dur="4.56">the economy is great</text>
  <text start="362.039" dur="8.43">the only thing adding to uncertainty is</text>
  <text start="364.949" dur="6.9">the fake news he continued to let</text>
  <text start="370.469" dur="4.081">everyone know that the tariffs are</text>
  <text start="371.849" dur="5.88">working the US economy is fantastic and</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="5.339">there is no recession China is eating</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="4.59">the tariffs billions pouring into the</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="4.26">u.s. targeted patriot farmers getting</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="4.88">massive dollars from the incoming</text>
  <text start="384.149" dur="6.57">tariffs good job numbers no inflation</text>
  <text start="387.199" dur="6.37">China having worst year in decades talks</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="5.01">happening good for all now think about</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="3.93">it the mainstream media was out there</text>
  <text start="395.729" dur="4.77">because they lost complete control of</text>
  <text start="397.499" dur="4.89">the central bank system the central bank</text>
  <text start="400.499" dur="4.2">was no longer going to raise rates in</text>
  <text start="402.389" dur="5.55">the year of 2019 to crash the economy in</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="4.62">2020 so the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="407.939" dur="3.57">they decided hey you know what we can do</text>
  <text start="409.319" dur="4.261">we can tell everyone that a recession is</text>
  <text start="411.509" dur="5.551">coming and everyone will believe this</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="7.019">and we will create the recession out of</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="6.029">thin air well they knew they only had a</text>
  <text start="420.599" dur="5.19">certain period of time they knew that</text>
  <text start="423.089" dur="5.76">once Trump gets that gets those rate</text>
  <text start="425.789" dur="5.371">cuts and starts stimulus that recession</text>
  <text start="428.849" dur="4.171">plan goes down the tubes</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="3.6">and there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do this is</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="3.33">why they started it up and they knew</text>
  <text start="434.76" dur="4.56">that there was going to be a point in</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="6.06">time when they were going to have to</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="7.32">backtrack well guess what that time is</text>
  <text start="442.41" dur="6.93">now they are backtracking why because</text>
  <text start="446.64" dur="4.74">guess what the Fed is about to do we</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="4.29">already know that behind the scenes they</text>
  <text start="451.38" dur="5.21">already started stimulus they already</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="5.37">know that there&amp;#39;s no recession coming</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="5.37">because in the beginning stages of all</text>
  <text start="459" dur="5.58">this the economy is going to take off</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="5.11">let&amp;#39;s look at what the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="5.73">is saying this is at a Forbes the Trump</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="6.33">2020 economic recession isn&amp;#39;t happening</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="6.44">this is out of the Washington Post why</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="6.78">the US won&amp;#39;t be in a recession in 2020</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="6.4">this is that New York Times a recession</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="5.94">isn&amp;#39;t inevitable the case for economic</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="5.84">optimism why all of a sudden they saying</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="7.65">hey I guess a recession isn&amp;#39;t coming and</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="6.88">they&amp;#39;re backtracking all the indicators</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="5.37">they were talking about everything that</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="4.98">they were telling us completely fake</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="5.09">phony and false remember this is a</text>
  <text start="500.85" dur="6.99">manipulated economy it&amp;#39;s an illusion</text>
  <text start="504.23" dur="5.59">Trump has the wand he&amp;#39;s controlling</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="4.65">everything remember</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="4.95">optics are very important why do you</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="4.37">think he continually hits at the Fed why</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="5.73">did he why does he call out Powell</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="6.67">because it can&amp;#39;t look political Trump</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="5.64">tweeted out the following I agree with</text>
  <text start="523.53" dur="5.82">Jim Cramer the Fed should lower rates</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="7.53">they were way too early to raise and way</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="7.74">too late to cut a big dose quantitative</text>

  <text start="543.86" dur="5.41">Fed Powell was out there and he was</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="4.53">asked a question you know our politics</text>

  <text start="680.29" dur="7.02">to convince us that this is a terrible</text>
  <text start="682.84" dur="5.81">idea that Trump is doing with China this</text>
  <text start="687.31" dur="4.14">shouldn&amp;#39;t be happening</text>
  <text start="688.65" dur="5.38">now remember there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="691.45" dur="4.24">goals associated with this I do believe</text>

  <text start="736.07" dur="9.36">this is the other part of the tariffs</text>
  <text start="739.94" dur="7.35">with China now the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="745.43" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t want everyday Americans to</text>
  <text start="747.29" dur="5.55">understand this process that Trump is</text>
  <text start="750.83" dur="3.21">bringing us through this global trade</text>

  <text start="776.57" dur="5.43">on a significant drop in German</text>
  <text start="779.63" dur="4.35">industrial orders and they specifically</text>
  <text start="782" dur="5.25">point to diminished orders from the UK</text>
  <text start="783.98" dur="5.4">small part and China big part as the</text>
  <text start="787.25" dur="4.8">cause whoever the analysis stops at the</text>
  <text start="789.38" dur="5.36">part where China&amp;#39;s lack of industrial</text>
  <text start="792.05" dur="5.39">orders is the leading contribution to</text>
  <text start="794.74" dur="5.53">retraction in the German export sector</text>
  <text start="797.44" dur="5.26">what the financial analysis does not</text>
  <text start="800.27" dur="4.62">approach is the reason why Chinese</text>
  <text start="802.7" dur="6.39">orders for German industrial goods have</text>

  <text start="832.93" dur="7.81">China is going to buy something guess</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="7.099">what they have less funds to do it the</text>
  <text start="840.74" dur="7.079">value of their currency has dropped</text>
  <text start="844.329" dur="7.69">because China devalued their currency</text>
  <text start="847.819" dur="7.32">which means that their exports are</text>
  <text start="852.019" dur="6.99">cheaper and at the same time it makes</text>
  <text start="855.139" dur="7.74">any of their imports more expensive so</text>
  <text start="859.009" dur="8.041">China buys less and that now exhibits in</text>
