  <text start="116.08" dur="6.42">a lot of pieces there&amp;#39;s a lot that needs</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="6.21">to be done and he is doing it remember</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="4.38">he has tariffs in place they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="5.55">for a reason he&amp;#39;s making new trade deals</text>

  <text start="130.09" dur="6.72">controlling the Fed this is being done</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="7.079">for a reason q has told us that gold is</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="5.79">going to bring down the Fed gold is</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="5.551">going to be used to counter fiat</text>

  <text start="167.5" dur="4.59">everything else he promised he was going</text>
  <text start="170.26" dur="5.28">to drain the swamp that includes the</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="5.61">economic swamp because if you have a</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="4.05">central bank controlling the economy and</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="3.99">you get rid of all the traders and the</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="4.59">treasonous individuals you still have</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.95">the central bank which means you still</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="5.46">have a fiat currency which means around</text>

  <text start="196.6" dur="8.04">spawns more traders treasonous criminal</text>
  <text start="200.79" dur="6.52">activity and the people around the world</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="5.85">they are speaking out against their</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="7.92">governments speaking out against central</text>
  <text start="210.49" dur="8.64">banks telling all these organizations</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="6.06">what they want and we see out in the UK</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="3.99">we know there&amp;#39;s a BRICS</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="4.58">going on the people voted in a</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="5.52">referendum and they want to leave the EU</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="4.21">now it seems that May is in a little bit</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="4.59">of trouble here because Parliament</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve seized control of the brexit</text>
  <text start="233.23" dur="6.66">from Theresa May and they pass what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="7.89">called the let when amendment and this</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="7.64">passed around 329 to 300 - and they</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="5.82">voted in favor of a government motion</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.59">now the amendment calls for time to be</text>
  <text start="250.27" dur="6.15">set aside on Wednesday for a series of</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="4.86">indicative votes on alternatives to the</text>
  <text start="256.42" dur="4.439">withdrawal agreement that may negotiate</text>
  <text start="257.98" dur="5.4">with the EU the options will range from</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="5.881">a soft brexit that could cross certain</text>
  <text start="263.38" dur="5.73">of maize red lines or a no brexit at all</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="5.76">so here are some of the deals that</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re looking at maize deal this deal</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="2.94">has been rejected twice already I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="5.13">think it&amp;#39;s gonna pass the third time</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="6.24">this is the EU deal a no brexit deal</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="4.95">this would lead to the UK leaving the EU</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="5.96">on the new revised date of April 12th on</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="6.3">the World Trade Organization terms</text>
  <text start="287.64" dur="4.96">eliminating a backstop this is in theory</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="4.26">would mean rewriting the withdrawal</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.969">agreements something the EU says we are</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="6.599">not going to do Canada style deal</text>
  <text start="298.569" dur="5.1">a popular idea with hardcore Exeter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="3.81">this would focus on the future trade</text>
  <text start="303.669" dur="3.9">deal with the EU rather than the</text>
  <text start="305.349" dur="4.261">withdrawal agreement in theory the UK</text>
  <text start="307.569" dur="5.43">would accept no continuing regulatory</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="6.389">alignment with the EU the Norway Plus</text>
  <text start="312.999" dur="4.801">deal this soft brexit alternative would</text>
  <text start="315.999" dur="3.81">keep the UK in the single market by</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="5.339">remaining in the European Economic Area</text>
  <text start="319.809" dur="7.65">and European free trade association</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="9.03">unlike EFTA the deal would also keep the</text>
  <text start="327.459" dur="6.6">UK in the customs union labor deal this</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="4.11">would mean the UK remains in customs</text>
  <text start="334.059" dur="4.621">union with the EU and remain close to</text>
  <text start="336.279" dur="3">the single market I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="3.299">gonna happen</text>
  <text start="339.279" dur="5.31">the second referendum again I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="6.18">think that&amp;#39;s going to happen so we see</text>
  <text start="344.589" dur="6.54">right now things are happening in the UK</text>
  <text start="348.159" dur="5.16">the EU is not getting what they want and</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="353.319" dur="5.82">but it looks like Mays days are numbered</text>
  <text start="356.949" dur="6.99">and I believe this is why Q said Mayday</text>
  <text start="359.139" dur="7.411">Mayday Mayday she is in trouble here in</text>
  <text start="363.939" dur="4.65">the United States we know that the Fed</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="6.899">they are in a holding pattern with the</text>
  <text start="368.589" dur="7.35">interest rates and the economy here in</text>
  <text start="373.449" dur="4.65">the United States started to decline</text>
  <text start="375.939" dur="4.65">very very rapidly when the Fed was</text>
  <text start="378.099" dur="4.23">raising rates since the Fed has been in</text>
  <text start="380.589" dur="4.11">a holding pattern we&amp;#39;re still seeing a</text>
  <text start="382.329" dur="4.531">decline in the housing market but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.699" dur="4.981">not happening as fast</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="4.649">now Case Shiller they came out with</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="5.37">their home price index and it was</text>
  <text start="391.509" dur="6.11">expected to show a growth but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="5.579">seeing that it&amp;#39;s continually slowing</text>
  <text start="397.619" dur="4.811">Case Shiller 20-city composite grew at</text>
  <text start="400.629" dur="4.47">just three point five five eight percent</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="5.06">year-on-year in January well below three</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="4.68">point eight percent urine Eirik spected</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="5.319">what is happening here and we need to go</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="4.86">back a little bit the central bank they</text>
  <text start="412.809" dur="5.04">picked these 20 cities where they can</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="5.28">push the bubbles up make it look like</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="4.47">real estate was doing fantastically and</text>
  <text start="419.919" dur="4.77">this is what they do they have hedge</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="4.26">funds investment companies they all</text>
  <text start="424.689" dur="4.56">invest in real estate they buy the</text>
  <text start="426.579" dur="5.201">houses they rent them if they can but</text>
  <text start="429.249" dur="5.531">they&amp;#39;re told to keep them off the market</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="5.1">this drives up the bubbles because you</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="3.6">have less inventory out there people</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="4.5">think the real estate market is hot and</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="5.94">people say hey I want in on this and it</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="5.67">drives the prices up and we see that</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="6.15">this is the weakest annual growth since</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="6.24">September 12 decelerating for a tenth</text>
  <text start="450.47" dur="4.8">month in January as buyers right now are</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="4.08">holding out for more affordable</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.35">properties remember when the interest</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="4.8">rates have moved up it throws a lot of</text>
  <text start="459.62" dur="4.86">buyers out of the market now since we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.17" dur="6.36">in this holding pattern I do believe the</text>
  <text start="464.48" dur="6.24">Patriots we&amp;#39;re hoping and we know that</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="4.43">they plan this out that real that the</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="5.37">real estate market wouldn&amp;#39;t decline as</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="5.2">quickly as it was because they know they</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="6.12">need to keep the economy very varied</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="6.42">aesthetic for the 2020 elections we see</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="5.4">building permits well they are dropping</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="7.08">very very rapidly now once again the Fed</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="6.93">might even have to lower the rates to</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="5.16">make sure that the economy stays the way</text>
  <text start="494.54" dur="3.3">it is I mean these are going to improve</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="2.37">and I&amp;#39;m talking I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="2.4">the statistical numbers I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="3.15">about the people so kind of in talking</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="3.75">about retail I&amp;#39;m talking about housing</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="6.75">I&amp;#39;m talking about automobile purchases</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="6.83">those type of things so if we if Trump</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="5.04">and the Patriots they see the economy</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="5.349">deteriorating even further as we get</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="3.99">closer and closer to the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="3.691">we might see the Fed say you know</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="5.52">something we might have to lower the</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="6.33">rates we&amp;#39;ll wait and see to see if that</text>
  <text start="523.64" dur="5.85">actually happens but right now we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="6.93">a holding pattern and the economy has</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="7.29">been stabilized as of right now now we</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="6.15">know that Trump is preparing this</text>
  <text start="536.78" dur="5.49">economy for a transition a transition</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="6.9">away from the central bank system and we</text>
  <text start="542.27" dur="5.76">know that Trump he&amp;#39;s placed a lot of</text>
  <text start="546.17" dur="5.85">tariffs on different sectors of the</text>
  <text start="548.03" dur="6.84">economy steel aluminum and many other</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="8.069">areas and of course he&amp;#39;s using this as</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="7.65">leverage to create better deals with</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="5.401">China but something very interesting</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="5.7">happened the United States Court</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="5.31">of international trade has rebuked a</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="5.4">global industry challenge to Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="4.65">steel and aluminum tariffs the court</text>
  <text start="573.62" dur="4.529">told the multinational trade association</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="6.09">they lacked any authority to override</text>

  <text start="625.22" dur="4.97">and we need to remember Trump is not</text>
  <text start="628.13" dur="6.54">doing this just to do it</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="6.61">he&amp;#39;s unwinding everything the globalists</text>
  <text start="634.67" dur="4.74">have done everything the central bank</text>

  <text start="639.41" dur="6.239">move everything out of this country and</text>
  <text start="642.399" dur="6.731">make it a third world nation think about</text>

  <text start="649.13" dur="5.64">came off the gold standard now they</text>
  <text start="651.589" dur="6.181">don&amp;#39;t do these things very quickly they</text>
