  <text start="117.58" dur="5.849">this going to happen how are they going</text>
  <text start="120.22" dur="6.66">to take our existing system and change</text>
  <text start="123.429" dur="8.131">it right now the central banks they are</text>

  <text start="131.56" dur="5.88">Fed they are running the world&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.68">and that all leads up to who the</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="4.909">Rothschilds and we need to remember if</text>
  <text start="140.02" dur="6.81">we go back to the Economist magazine</text>
  <text start="142.349" dur="6.791">they said in the year of 2018 what did</text>
  <text start="146.83" dur="6.09">they tell us they told us that we were</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="6.81">going to be moving to a gold system now</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="6.87">does it mean exactly in the year 2018 or</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="7.83">is that the beginning of the entire</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="4.74">world moving to a gold system now which</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="2.58">is</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="7.71">very odd because that was put out a</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="8.4">while ago Q just recently said that the</text>
  <text start="172.24" dur="5.73">Fed is gonna be brought down by gold</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="4.71">which is real money so when you start to</text>
  <text start="177.97" dur="3.63">think about all this you&amp;#39;re saying whoa</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s going on here we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="3.389">talking about that a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="183.34" dur="3.93">this report we&amp;#39;re also gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="184.989" dur="5.131">about how Trump actually has been</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="6.24">talking about using gold in this</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="6.869">economic system way before Q even</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="5.46">mentioned anything but let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="3.991">world economy right now because things</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.04">are starting to break apart and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.98" dur="5.28">get me wrong here the Patriots Trump</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="4.32">they already knew that this central bank</text>
  <text start="206.26" dur="3.87">system when I talked about the economy</text>
  <text start="208.33" dur="4.89">coming down they already knew that this</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="5.609">central bank economy cannot stand the</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="4.5">way it is right now that eventually it</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="3.241">would have to be reset and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="4.769">watching right now and it just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.82">start in 2016 or 2015 this started a</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="5.071">long time ago but it&amp;#39;s really it really</text>
  <text start="224.8" dur="4.11">became noticeable in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="3.929">everything just came to a screeching</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="6.09">halt and this is why the central banks</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="6.991">had to start creating currency like</text>
  <text start="235" dur="7.59">there was no tomorrow they needed some</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="7.349">type of collapse some type of Great</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="5.489">Recession to scare everyone because they</text>
  <text start="245.829" dur="4.681">knew if they didn&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="248.079" dur="4.321">it would have just come down right there</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="3.93">and then but they knew and this was</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="4.41">planned they knew they needed some time</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="4.62">to get everything prepared for their</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="5.76">transition and this is why this happened</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="6.78">in 2008 they needed that ability to</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="6.69">create a lot of currency to prop up the</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="5.37">global system and allow them to</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="4.32">transition someplace else remember their</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="3">plans were completely different than</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="3.81">they are today</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="4.89">their plan was to mask everything with</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="4.47">some type of world event which is most</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="6.39">likely be a war now they don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="6.809">so everything that they&amp;#39;ve done was to</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="5.97">create this illusion that the economy</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="3.81">was doing well but we know because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="2.85">been following it for a very long time</text>
  <text start="292.479" dur="4.37">and this was the whole purpose of it we</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="4.369">knew that the economy was built on in</text>
  <text start="296.849" dur="3.3">illusion and now that illusion is</text>
  <text start="298.679" dur="3.871">breaking apart falling apart and</text>
  <text start="300.149" dur="4.86">imploding on itself which we knew what</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="4.889">was going to happen we see the European</text>
  <text start="305.009" dur="4.86">auto registrations they have plunged for</text>
  <text start="307.439" dur="5.85">the third month in a row down 8.8% in</text>
  <text start="309.869" dur="5.13">November now once again once you start</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="4.65">seeing this type of data where the</text>
  <text start="314.999" dur="4.65">automobile industry is you know</text>
  <text start="317.939" dur="3.99">declining very rapidly in other</text>
  <text start="319.649" dur="3.841">countries China&amp;#39;s already recognized</text>
  <text start="321.929" dur="4.44">that their automobile industry is</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="5.609">declining Europe their automobile</text>
  <text start="326.369" dur="5.04">industry is declining the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="329.099" dur="5.21">automobile industry is declining all of</text>
  <text start="331.409" dur="5.94">this is happening for the same reason</text>
  <text start="334.309" dur="5.23">the entire system was built on an</text>
  <text start="337.349" dur="4.231">illusion and when the illusion breaks</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="4.261">away from what is really going on in the</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="3.209">economy this is why you start to see</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="5.329">these things we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="7.41">homes and the prices of homes and</text>
  <text start="349.129" dur="6.52">existing home sales for a very long time</text>
  <text start="352.199" dur="7.98">we discussed many times over how the</text>
  <text start="355.649" dur="7.651">entire housing market was created to</text>
  <text start="360.179" dur="5.67">make it look like the housing market was</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="6.929">booming but it was one gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="365.849" dur="7.92">we knew going back in time the central</text>
  <text start="370.229" dur="5.25">banks told the banks listen don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.769" dur="4.14">foreclose on the homes let people live</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="4.951">in it keep homes off the market that</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="4.68">will drive prices up we will give this</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="3.81">free money money and this low interest</text>
  <text start="382.589" dur="3.3">rate to all these hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="4.589">investment companies to invest in homes</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="5.52">that one house to house tens of</text>
  <text start="388.829" dur="4.98">thousands of homes keep them off the</text>
  <text start="391.409" dur="5.25">market what does it do it drives prices</text>
  <text start="393.809" dur="4.47">up we&amp;#39;re starting to see it all fall</text>
  <text start="396.659" dur="3.87">apart right now why because all these</text>
  <text start="398.279" dur="4.831">different investment houses they are</text>
  <text start="400.529" dur="3.81">selling they want to get rid of what</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="3.089">they have right now because if they hold</text>
  <text start="404.339" dur="3.901">on to it it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="406.199" dur="5.34">disaster so out in the west coast</text>

  <text start="436.78" dur="5.73">that was in the spring of the same year</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="5.87">so in the spring it was seven hundred</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="7.05">and twenty six thousand it came down</text>

  <text start="451.72" dur="7.74">thousand dollars to be exact that is</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="6.21">huge and if you look around the entire</text>

  <text start="474.64" dur="4.74">about their independence and central</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="4.74">bank&amp;#39;s everywhere struggling to stay</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="4.65">above politics and we see that many</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="3.3">central bankers they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="3.69">resign actually the governor of the</text>

  <text start="487.72" dur="5.49">weeks after the government moved to</text>
  <text start="489.73" dur="5.94">exert more control over RBI&amp;#39;s regulatory</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="4.77">powers we&amp;#39;re seeing other central</text>
  <text start="495.67" dur="5.45">bankers out there and they are worried</text>
  <text start="497.98" dur="6.18">about their independence which means</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="5.71">country after country after country the</text>
  <text start="504.16" dur="5.49">people in all these countries they are</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="5.1">questioning the central bank and should</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="4.29">they be independent now Trump has been</text>
  <text start="511.93" dur="3.72">doing this quite often he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="2.94">contradicting the Fed saying that they</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="3.51">shouldn&amp;#39;t be raising rates</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="4.56">this is ridiculous what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="519.16" dur="5.69">if the economy falls apart it&amp;#39;s the feds</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="7.5">fault this is all being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="7.68">why because they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="6.54">blame the Fed when the system fails and</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="6.13">actually who really is responsible it is</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="6.03">the Fed it&amp;#39;s their system Trump the</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="4.56">Patriots those working with him they</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="4.74">already know that a central banking</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="7.38">system does not last that long the debt</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="6.69">load crushes their system and this is</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="7.1">why they&amp;#39;re preparing to take down the</text>
  <text start="552.94" dur="8.93">Fed using gold now we need to remember a</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="6.02">central bank their monetary system on a</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="4.819">reserve</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="5.34">nc basis is completely unsustainable and</text>
  <text start="566.689" dur="3.781">again trumpet the Patriots they know</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="3.719">this this is why Trump has Andrew</text>

  <text start="578.509" dur="6.151">be true now back in 2016 before Trump</text>
  <text start="582.259" dur="5.01">was elected president he was out there</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="3.599">on different interviews and he made</text>
  <text start="587.269" dur="3.211">different quotes and there were</text>
  <text start="588.259" dur="3.841">different articles that came out about</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="4.289">how Trump used gold</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="5.099">here&amp;#39;s one from Bloomberg which Donald</text>
  <text start="594.769" dur="5.911">Trump says Donald Trump loves gold and</text>
  <text start="597.199" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t forget it what could his obsession</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="5.519">tell us about his message another one</text>
  <text start="603.829" dur="5.31">from Forbes Donald Trump the gold</text>

  <text start="612.05" dur="8.43">station WMUR and he said we used to have</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="7.59">a very very solid country because it was</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="8.13">based on the gold standard he was also</text>
  <text start="625.31" dur="5.49">in GQ where he said bringing back the</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="5.43">gold standard would be very hard to do</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="5.93">but boy would it be wonderful we&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="5.64">a standard on which to base our money</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="6.339">right there and then with all of this</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="5.43">you can see that Trump has always been</text>
  <text start="643.069" dur="5.731">on the track of bringing back the gold</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="6.029">standard or using gold as a confidence</text>

  <text start="671.089" dur="3.42">research into the Grand Canyon saying</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of gold in the</text>
  <text start="674.509" dur="5.041">Grand Canyon and I believe that this</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="6.359">might be one of the locations where gold</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="8.729">might be and with Trump saying this with</text>
  <text start="683.839" dur="6.6">cue saying this we can see that gold is</text>
  <text start="688.279" dur="5.48">going to be the weapon of choice coming</text>
  <text start="690.439" dur="7.051">out of the Economist they&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="693.759" dur="7.481">predicted in 2018 the entire</text>
  <text start="697.49" dur="6.48">structure would be heading into a gold</text>
  <text start="701.24" dur="6.719">standard actually Q is saying that the</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="6.2">economic structure is about to change so</text>
  <text start="707.959" dur="4.531">what would be the outcome of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.17" dur="4.84">following his instincts and going for</text>
  <text start="712.49" dur="7.05">gold well that would be prosperity</text>
  <text start="715.01" dur="7.199">that&amp;#39;s what how might President Trump go</text>
  <text start="719.54" dur="5.549">about turning this around well he has a</text>
  <text start="722.209" dur="6.901">unique opening to forcefully pivot</text>
  <text start="725.089" dur="5.551">America toward epic prosperity replace</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="5.039">the dollar with gold as a global</text>
  <text start="730.64" dur="9.62">currency to make America great again we</text>
  <text start="734.149" dur="11.25">have the gold it is possible to do this</text>
  <text start="740.26" dur="9.87">this would destroy the entire central</text>
  <text start="745.399" dur="10.921">banking system because if every country</text>
  <text start="750.13" dur="8.44">used gold everyone would realize that</text>
  <text start="756.32" dur="7.07">the paper money the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="758.57" dur="7.59">been pushing is absolutely worthless and</text>
  <text start="763.39" dur="6.73">people would also realize and recognize</text>
  <text start="766.16" dur="7.38">that gold has been suppressed for a very</text>
  <text start="770.12" dur="7.77">long time because once countries start</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="6.69">to use gold guess what the manipulation</text>
  <text start="777.89" dur="4.71">comes to an end the central bankers will</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="4.5">not be able to manipulate it and then</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;ll find out what gold is really</text>
  <text start="784.73" dur="8.01">worth compared to the central bankers</text>
  <text start="787.13" dur="8.76">paper fiat currency so we can see just</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="7.05">by Trump&amp;#39;s quotes his interviews he is</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="7.5">on the same page it&amp;#39;s not just Q saying</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="10.32">it they are working together with others</text>
  <text start="803.39" dur="10.889">to push us into a gold back system or a</text>
  <text start="810.11" dur="8.51">gold confidence system to allow the</text>
  <text start="814.279" dur="7.741">country to allow the world to become</text>
  <text start="818.62" dur="6.37">prosperous because without the central</text>
  <text start="822.02" dur="6.99">bank the way things look today will look</text>
  <text start="824.99" dur="5.43">very very different not just here in the</text>
  <text start="829.01" dur="5.7">United States but</text>
  <text start="830.42" dur="8.91">the world we&amp;#39;re not used to living in a</text>
  <text start="834.71" dur="7.83">world of prosperity with maybe little or</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="6.69">no taxes without checks and balances</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed for a very long</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="7.19">time to live in the central bankers</text>
  <text start="849.05" dur="7.53">world of debt of only knowing debt and</text>
  <text start="853.21" dur="7.42">what defines you your credits chord and</text>
  <text start="856.58" dur="7.95">how well you handle that debt I mean</text>
  <text start="860.63" dur="5.76">think about what they&amp;#39;ve done and they</text>
  <text start="864.53" dur="5.34">made us believe that what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="866.39" dur="5.31">in the economy is completely natural but</text>
  <text start="869.87" dur="3.93">we know it&amp;#39;s manipulated we know that</text>
  <text start="871.7" dur="4.98">Trump has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="4.56">I mean before him Obama had the magic</text>
  <text start="876.68" dur="5.7">wand but they&amp;#39;re using it differently</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="7.08">and we know that everything is about to</text>
  <text start="882.38" dur="7.04">change and yes it will be a bumpy ride</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="6.57">because when you&amp;#39;re moving off a paper</text>
  <text start="889.42" dur="5.32">currency that is absolutely worthless</text>
  <text start="892.01" dur="7.16">that&amp;#39;s based or backed by absolutely</text>
  <text start="894.74" dur="8.01">nothing and moving into real money well</text>
  <text start="899.17" dur="5.29">people are going to take a hit I mean</text>
  <text start="902.75" dur="5.91">think about it when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="904.46" dur="6.15">standard and moved to paper currency it</text>
  <text start="908.66" dur="6.51">was a little different because they were</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="8.82">able to create a lot more currency to</text>
  <text start="915.17" dur="7.53">make it feel like your currency bought a</text>
  <text start="919.43" dur="6.57">lot more so your salary went up home</text>
  <text start="922.7" dur="5.31">prices went up products went up but it</text>
  <text start="926" dur="3.9">wasn&amp;#39;t because they were going up it was</text>
  <text start="928.01" dur="5.67">because you needed more of that dollar</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="6.75">to do the same exact thing now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="933.68" dur="4.8">doing it the opposite way and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="936.65" dur="3.03">in the beginning it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="938.48" dur="2.97">little hard a lot of people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="939.68" dur="3.99">gold and it&amp;#39;s going to be pretty</text>
  <text start="941.45" dur="3.78">difficult or silver or anything and</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;ll be a little bit difficult in the</text>
  <text start="945.23" dur="6.66">beginning but eventually once the system</text>
  <text start="949.13" dur="5.37">gets online everyone will see the</text>
  <text start="951.89" dur="6.18">difference and it&amp;#39;ll be a huge</text>
  <text start="954.5" dur="5.34">eye-opener to everyone because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="958.07" dur="4.5">been brainwashed to think that this</text>
  <text start="959.84" dur="4.35">system this global system with all this</text>
