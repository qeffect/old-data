  <text start="933.22" dur="6.21">the drachma or they can introduce the</text>
  <text start="936.279" dur="5.281">new drachma and basically switch</text>

  <text start="1568.09" dur="3.93">this is about here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1569.44" dur="6.27">of course they can keep it a secret</text>
  <text start="1572.02" dur="5.58">because the president decided listen the</text>

  <text start="1597.42" dur="4.87">continually happening throughout the</text>

  <text start="1602.29" dur="5.97">ahead and gave the fast track for the</text>
  <text start="1604.33" dur="6.57">taa the next on line is the TPP and this</text>
  <text start="1608.26" dur="5.549">means that the President does not have</text>
  <text start="1610.9" dur="6.33">to work with Congress to make any type</text>
  <text start="1613.809" dur="7.61">of trade negotiation it&amp;#39;s basically like</text>
  <text start="1617.23" dur="7.02">a dictatorship we see out in Armenia</text>
  <text start="1621.419" dur="4.44">where it looks like there&amp;#39;s another</text>

  <text start="1625.859" dur="4.51">you know being stirred up in this</text>
  <text start="1628.749" dur="5.01">country and this was all about a</text>
  <text start="1630.369" dur="6.75">16-percent hike in electricity prices</text>
  <text start="1633.759" dur="8.03">which is very odd to have these huge</text>
  <text start="1637.119" dur="7.77">protest but okay let&amp;#39;s go with it the</text>
  <text start="1641.789" dur="6.48">government there said ok we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1644.889" dur="7.98">suspend the electricity price hike and</text>

  <text start="1652.869" dur="7.23">concessions fell short they want it</text>
  <text start="1657.429" dur="5.781">completely reversed so it was suspended</text>
  <text start="1660.099" dur="8.28">right now they&amp;#39;re still not happy and</text>
  <text start="1663.21" dur="7.929">they&amp;#39;re still protesting this kind of</text>
  <text start="1668.379" dur="6.35">shows us that something else is going on</text>
  <text start="1671.139" dur="8.1">right now because if they suspended it</text>
  <text start="1674.729" dur="8.82">that means the normal price is back in</text>
  <text start="1679.239" dur="8.28">existence and there is no increase</text>
  <text start="1683.549" dur="7.11">reversing it is the same effect I mean</text>
  <text start="1687.519" dur="5.04">if they decide to increase the</text>
  <text start="1690.659" dur="4.061">electricity costs once again the</text>
  <text start="1692.559" dur="4.11">protesters will be out there but why are</text>
  <text start="1694.72" dur="3.659">they continually protesting why won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1696.669" dur="4.531">they stop now if the president comes out</text>
  <text start="1698.379" dur="6.6">and reverses it and they continually</text>
  <text start="1701.2" dur="6.299">protest then we know for sure that this</text>
  <text start="1704.979" dur="5.731">is definitely a color revolution and we</text>
  <text start="1707.499" dur="8.1">have to remember in Armenia Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1710.71" dur="8.459">Gazprom is looking to purchase the Iran</text>
  <text start="1715.599" dur="5.55">pipeline with Armenia and we also</text>

  <text start="1732.58" dur="5.789">government central bankers would love to</text>
  <text start="1735.429" dur="4.68">kick out Russia and to put in their own</text>

  <text start="1753.159" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re going to give any more discounts</text>
  <text start="1754.419" dur="3.75">that a natural gas because it looks like</text>
  <text start="1756.399" dur="2.791">at this point in time that everyone</text>
  <text start="1758.169" dur="4.441">needs to pay this</text>
  <text start="1759.19" dur="6.75">same rate well Ukrainian energy missed</text>
  <text start="1762.61" dur="5.22">minister said okay listen give us a</text>
  <text start="1765.94" dur="3.9">discount price and we&amp;#39;ll take a look at</text>
  <text start="1767.83" dur="4.35">it they took a look they took a look at</text>

  <text start="1772.18" dur="5.4">they said you know what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1773.77" dur="6.11">decline it so Russia and Ukraine failed</text>
  <text start="1777.58" dur="8.46">to reach new agreement on gas prices in</text>
  <text start="1779.88" dur="9.15">Vienna and right now Ukraine is going to</text>
  <text start="1786.04" dur="7.37">suspend its purchases of Russian gas is</text>
  <text start="1789.03" dur="6.43">this an indicator at this point that</text>
  <text start="1793.41" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re cutting themselves off from</text>
  <text start="1795.46" dur="4.26">Russia we&amp;#39;re going into the summer</text>
  <text start="1798.43" dur="3.02">months they don&amp;#39;t need as much they</text>
  <text start="1799.72" dur="5.28">probably have a lot in the storage and</text>
  <text start="1801.45" dur="7.06">does this mean that the offensive is on</text>
  <text start="1805" dur="4.92">because they just cut off the gas coming</text>
  <text start="1808.51" dur="3.33">into the country they did this once</text>
  <text start="1809.92" dur="3.12">before but then of course they went into</text>
  <text start="1811.84" dur="4.26">the winter months now we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1813.04" dur="5.67">spring going into the summer so it looks</text>
  <text start="1816.1" dur="4.47">like we are headed towards another</text>
  <text start="1818.71" dur="4.47">offensive and we have to remember McCain</text>
  <text start="1820.57" dur="5.97">was in Ukraine giving a speech saying</text>
  <text start="1823.18" dur="6.53">listen Ukraine is going to be off</text>
  <text start="1826.54" dur="5.34">Russian gas within the next two years</text>
  <text start="1829.71" dur="4.57">which means it&amp;#39;s already in the works</text>
  <text start="1831.88" dur="6.21">which means they could be a lot closer</text>
  <text start="1834.28" dur="5.55">than we think so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1838.09" dur="4.29">watch this situation very very closely</text>
  <text start="1839.83" dur="5.1">now hackers from the group called cyber</text>
  <text start="1842.38" dur="4.5">Baku they have leaked thousands of</text>

  <text start="1858.22" dur="8.43">increase the number of troops up to</text>
  <text start="1861.39" dur="9.85">250,000 because they are prepared and</text>
  <text start="1866.65" dur="7.35">ready for this offensive and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1871.24" dur="4.83">trying to kick it off as soon as</text>
  <text start="1874" dur="7.98">possible they believe they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="1876.07" dur="9.42">go now in Europe we see that Europe</text>
  <text start="1881.98" dur="5.7">might impose border controls between the</text>
  <text start="1885.49" dur="7.29">country so this will no longer be an</text>

  <text start="1897.46" dur="4.83">reintroduce border controls but doing so</text>
  <text start="1900.85" dur="4.05">would damage one of the strongest</text>
  <text start="1902.29" dur="6.92">symbols of the European unity the</text>
  <text start="1904.9" dur="8.88">question is why are they doing this why</text>
  <text start="1909.21" dur="7.89">put border controls up well they can</text>
  <text start="1913.78" dur="7.56">stop the transfer of physical cash</text>
  <text start="1917.1" dur="6.82">leaving the country because again a lot</text>
  <text start="1921.34" dur="3.99">of people are looking at the situation a</text>
  <text start="1923.92" dur="4.14">lot of people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="1925.33" dur="5.97">something i want my physical cash and i</text>
  <text start="1928.06" dur="4.92">might take it out of the country and you</text>
  <text start="1931.3" dur="4.59">know set up shop someplace else</text>
  <text start="1932.98" dur="5.43">companies might do this people might do</text>
  <text start="1935.89" dur="6.33">this and what they want to do is they</text>
  <text start="1938.41" dur="6.42">want to keep all the currency in the</text>
  <text start="1942.22" dur="5.04">country and I believe at this point in</text>
  <text start="1944.83" dur="6.48">time they&amp;#39;re going to be setting all of</text>
  <text start="1947.26" dur="7.83">this up to keep control and keep control</text>
  <text start="1951.31" dur="5.28">the system so it does not collapse so we</text>
  <text start="1955.09" dur="3.45">have to watch this very carefully and I</text>
  <text start="1956.59" dur="3.6">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we see</text>
  <text start="1958.54" dur="5.16">something happen here in the United</text>
  <text start="1960.19" dur="6.32">States to control the cash the illegals</text>
  <text start="1963.7" dur="7.05">can come in but the cash cannot leave</text>
  <text start="1966.51" dur="7.3">now back in March the European</text>
  <text start="1970.75" dur="5.13">Commissioner jean-claude younger said</text>
  <text start="1973.81" dur="5.52">that the European Union needed to create</text>

  <text start="1982.9" dur="7.41">now it seems that one in three EU</text>
  <text start="1987.31" dur="7.86">citizens wants an EU army to replace the</text>
  <text start="1990.31" dur="8.28">NATO reliance and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1995.17" dur="5.55">the EU army could be dispatched to any</text>

  <text start="2005.76" dur="5.82">dispatched if there&amp;#39;s an invasion they</text>
  <text start="2008.91" dur="6.12">can be dispatched and it looks like</text>
  <text start="2011.58" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re trying to push this and it looks</text>
  <text start="2015.03" dur="4.31">like they&amp;#39;re trying to have the central</text>
  <text start="2017.52" dur="7.32">bankers are trying to have their own</text>
  <text start="2019.34" dur="7.27">armed forces now heat we understand here</text>
  <text start="2024.84" dur="4.62">in the united states that the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="2026.61" dur="6.74">f-35 stealth jet is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="2029.46" dur="6.69">they spent a trillion dollars on it and</text>
  <text start="2033.35" dur="5.5">it just doesn&amp;#39;t work so they decided to</text>
  <text start="2036.15" dur="7.62">have a mock air battle between an f-16</text>
  <text start="2038.85" dur="7.709">jet and the new f-35 stealth jet and it</text>
  <text start="2043.77" dur="5.25">showed that the f-35 is too sluggish to</text>

  <text start="2049.02" dur="5.22">it is a complete disaster it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2051.6" dur="6.299">complete waste of money and it is one of</text>
  <text start="2054.24" dur="8.1">the most expensive weapons in history</text>
  <text start="2057.899" dur="6.871">which just doesn&amp;#39;t work and this is why</text>

  <text start="2064.77" dur="7.95">Russia we can beat China again China and</text>
  <text start="2067.919" dur="7.561">Russia they are not Yemen Iraq Libya</text>
  <text start="2072.72" dur="4.77">these are advanced actors and a lot of</text>
  <text start="2075.48" dur="6.84">their weapons and planes and missiles</text>
  <text start="2077.49" dur="9.3">are better than the United States they</text>
  <text start="2082.32" dur="7.89">have better military assets plus they</text>
  <text start="2086.79" dur="5.819">have nuclear weapons so this is not a</text>
  <text start="2090.21" dur="4.919">fight we want to have but of course the</text>
  <text start="2092.609" dur="5.461">warmongers up in the government they</text>
  <text start="2095.129" dur="5.99">want a fight they want it to cover up</text>
  <text start="2098.07" dur="5.07">the economic collapse now we understand</text>

  <text start="2114.9" dur="5.01">to have some type of an extension and</text>
  <text start="2116.96" dur="5.17">right now we see there a lot of</text>
  <text start="2119.91" dur="5.1">companies a lot of countries that would</text>
  <text start="2122.13" dur="4.8">love to do business with Iran in France</text>
  <text start="2125.01" dur="4.65">is about a hundred and hundred French</text>

  <text start="2129.66" dur="5.79">a joint delegation to the Iranian</text>
  <text start="2131.58" dur="9.21">capital because they would love to do</text>
  <text start="2135.45" dur="7.8">business with Iran I mean back before</text>
  <text start="2140.79" dur="5.94">the sanctions France and Iran stood at</text>
  <text start="2143.25" dur="5.04">over about 3.4 billion in 2011 but fell</text>
  <text start="2146.73" dur="3.48">to about five hundred and fifty six</text>
  <text start="2148.29" dur="6.84">million after the sanctions were imposed</text>
  <text start="2150.21" dur="6.75">so they lost a lot of business and Obama</text>
  <text start="2155.13" dur="5.43">is out there and say he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="2156.96" dur="8.82">listen he will walk a</text>
  <text start="2160.56" dur="9.57">a from a bad nuclear deal with Iran well</text>
  <text start="2165.78" dur="7.14">replace that with banking deal he will</text>
  <text start="2170.13" dur="4.79">walk away from a bad banking deal with</text>
  <text start="2172.92" dur="5.25">Iran because like I said in the past</text>
  <text start="2174.92" dur="6.49">this is not about nuclear weapons this</text>

  <text start="2400.18" dur="5.52">governments in those countries this is</text>
  <text start="2403.21" dur="7.68">what we see happening right now and this</text>
  <text start="2405.7" dur="7.23">is a signal to everyone that they are</text>
  <text start="2410.89" dur="5.07">pushing the agenda because they realize</text>
  <text start="2412.93" dur="5.429">that the economy is completely falling</text>
  <text start="2415.96" dur="4.02">apart now can they prop it up for a</text>
  <text start="2418.359" dur="3.091">little while longer of course they can</text>
  <text start="2419.98" dur="3.81">they can use tricks they can create</text>
  <text start="2421.45" dur="3.69">money they can inflate the bubbles</text>
  <text start="2423.79" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a very long</text>
  <text start="2425.14" dur="3.99">time but sooner or later</text>
  <text start="2427.36" dur="4.23">they will not be able to do it they will</text>
  <text start="2429.13" dur="4.26">lose control and they know this and this</text>
  <text start="2431.59" dur="3.9">is why they&amp;#39;re accelerating everything</text>
  <text start="2433.39" dur="4.44">they see what&amp;#39;s happening in Greece they</text>
  <text start="2435.49" dur="6.54">see what&amp;#39;s going on in Puerto Rico they</text>
  <text start="2437.83" dur="8.82">see in Italy France this is a domino</text>
  <text start="2442.03" dur="7.1">effect which basically now is out of</text>
  <text start="2446.65" dur="9.93">their control and they understand this</text>
  <text start="2449.13" dur="10.42">we c JH 15 it&amp;#39;s not going to end in</text>

  <text start="2462.13" dur="8.01">is jade helm I&amp;#39;m talking about and the</text>
  <text start="2466.75" dur="10.62">question is why is this being extended</text>
  <text start="2470.14" dur="9.45">now what is planned do they do they</text>
  <text start="2477.37" dur="4.5">believe they&amp;#39;re going to lose control</text>
  <text start="2479.59" dur="5.48">during this period and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2481.87" dur="5.79">give the green light for a go-ahead</text>
  <text start="2485.07" dur="6.31">because everything is positioned and</text>
  <text start="2487.66" dur="7.71">ready for some type of an event I know</text>
  <text start="2491.38" dur="6.15">the FBI DHS is all out there giving us</text>
  <text start="2495.37" dur="4.65">warnings about this fourth of July now</text>
  <text start="2497.53" dur="6.42">again something could happen something</text>

  <text start="2503.95" dur="5.97">oh look they&amp;#39;re coming after our</text>
  <text start="2505.84" dur="5.64">freedoms our independence or are they</text>

  <text start="2511.48" dur="7.41">people to keep them in fear for the next</text>
  <text start="2514.6" dur="10.26">event and while all this is going on we</text>
  <text start="2518.89" dur="8.76">realize that this economy is barely</text>
  <text start="2524.86" dur="8.36">limping along the statistical</text>
  <text start="2527.65" dur="10.32">information does not match the real</text>
  <text start="2533.22" dur="6.1">economy indicators I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2537.97" dur="4.44">telling us that we&amp;#39;re almost at full</text>

  <text start="2568.63" dur="6.47">because of the Internet well then we</text>
  <text start="2570.88" dur="6.96">should see internet sites all the sales</text>
  <text start="2575.1" dur="5.23">increasing dramatically because people</text>
  <text start="2577.84" dur="4.74">have so much disposable income that they</text>
  <text start="2580.33" dur="4.62">just you know they don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="2582.58" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re just going to keep spending but</text>
  <text start="2584.95" dur="5.31">guess what we&amp;#39;re not seeing that they</text>
  <text start="2587.08" dur="6.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t need all the draconian programs</text>
  <text start="2590.26" dur="6.96">for giving loans to subprime people 0%</text>
