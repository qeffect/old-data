  <text start="110.74" dur="4.44">starting to heat up and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="4.8">starting to accelerate and it looks like</text>
  <text start="115.18" dur="5.939">right now that a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="117.82" dur="5.87">within government as CEOs of financial</text>
  <text start="121.119" dur="4.651">institutions and CEOs of other firms</text>
  <text start="123.69" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re gonna be selling their stocks</text>
  <text start="125.77" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re gonna be resigning and</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="4.87">everything&amp;#39;s gonna start to change I</text>
  <text start="129.58" dur="4.17">mean we already see Cohen he left</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="4.11">because he didn&amp;#39;t like what Trump is</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="4.98">doing with the tariffs of course</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="5.25">remember these individuals they&amp;#39;re part</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="5.97">of the system when you&amp;#39;re not working</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="5.63">with their system they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="5.789">a part of it we already see lloyd</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="6.31">blankfein who is the CEO of Goldman he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="6.421">stepping down now Q was out there saying</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="7.62">that Cohen his decision to leave was not</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="6.359">his choice he was actually told to leave</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="4.679">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and I do</text>
  <text start="163.269" dur="5.851">believe that we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="165.579" dur="6.321">more individuals start to leave the</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="5.78">White House and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="6.79">CEOs maybe Jamie Dimon and many others</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="5.35">start to remove themselves from their</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="4.049">positions because what I think is</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.43">happening right now is we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="182.739" dur="3.771">phase where things are all coming around</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="2.3">the</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="3.449">type of individuals especially the</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="3.899">central bank and I know the corporate</text>
  <text start="189.959" dur="5.221">media is out there screaming about you</text>
  <text start="191.879" dur="6.991">know trade Wars tariffs are terrible now</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="6.869">remember the corporate media they have</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="5.63">an agenda and whatever they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="202.049" dur="4.351">it&amp;#39;s most likely the opposite actually</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.06">many times then what you look at the</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="4.05">situations it&amp;#39;s always been the opposite</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="3.239">now China and of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="3.06">saying is China&amp;#39;s leave you know go</text>
  <text start="211.799" dur="4.621">start a trade war and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="5.25">disastrous but actually China is out</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="2.879">there and remember Trump is speaking to</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="4.47">China</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="7.141">quite often you Jinping and China is</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="6.21">saying listen we&amp;#39;re not looking to have</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="5.85">a trade war because if we do have a</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="4.74">trade war it would bring disaster to our</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="4.8">two countries as well as the rest of the</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="6.029">world China does not wish to fight a</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="7.11">trade war nor will China initiate a</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="9.9">trade war so this was already discussed</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="8.28">ahead of time and right now China is not</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="4.38">going to make the next move now of</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="3.24">course it looks like what the corporate</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="3.72">media is doing is the same thing they</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="4.049">did with North Korea where North Korea</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="2.911">is getting ready to attack North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re getting ready to do this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="3.87">getting ready with all our warplanes to</text>
  <text start="262.949" dur="4.59">go into North Korea they&amp;#39;re building it</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.23">up to make us feel like this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.539" dur="2.641">going to happen but the opposite is</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="3.9">happening right now</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="5.73">and all of this is being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s no coincidence there is nothing</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="5.939">like this this is a plan that has been</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="6.42">set and they&amp;#39;re following the plan to</text>
  <text start="281.849" dur="5.581">completely transition the economy into</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="4.949">the new system the system that we are in</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="5.91">this is the deep state central bank</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="5.49">system and when all said and done they</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="5.34">will be removing the central bank now</text>
  <text start="295.409" dur="5.13">they have already started to maneuver in</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.47">that direction and they do it very</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="5.94">slowly they get reports together they</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="5.79">need to gather the evidence to make the</text>
  <text start="306.479" dur="5.011">case to the American people to tell</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="5.4">everyone why we need to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="5.31">central bank now if we go back to 2015</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="4.71">there was a study by researchers at Duke</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="3.58">University and the University of</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="4.56">California at Berkeley</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="5.67">- quantitative evidence that the Fed</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="4.69">consistently leaks non-public</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.23">information about its meeting well</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s really hard to believe we all</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.67">kind of knew this now the study</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="5.61">first reported by The Daily Californian</text>
  <text start="334.95" dur="5.86">considers historical patterns in stock</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="5.4">prices relative to the distribution of</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="5.37">non-public Fed information the Fed uses</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="5.67">informal communication channels on an</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.67">even-numbered weeks after FM Fmoc</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="4.92">meetings this is what the report is</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="3.93">saying pointing to leaks making it into</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="3.81">media stories such as The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="5.93">Journal as well as showing up in private</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="6.45">financial advice to support their claims</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="5.95">researchers pointed to a private advice</text>
  <text start="364.48" dur="5.46">received by financial investors and news</text>
  <text start="367.66" dur="5.19">reports that contain non-public</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="5.58">information discussed in FOMC meetings</text>
  <text start="372.85" dur="5.1">the informal communications can steer</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="4.41">market expectations by engaging with</text>
  <text start="377.95" dur="5.22">private forecasters and newsletters that</text>
  <text start="379.93" dur="4.65">influence market inference of current</text>
  <text start="383.17" dur="4.8">and future policy this is what the</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="6.24">report said it said citing the goal of</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="5.73">managing market expectations in formal</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="5.04">communication facilitates learning by</text>
  <text start="393.7" dur="3.77">the Fed from financial sector about how</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="4.35">the feds assessment of the economy</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="5.26">compares to that of the financial sector</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.95">and about how markets are likely to</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="5.36">react to particularly Paul&amp;#39;s policy</text>
  <text start="405.16" dur="7.68">decisions now to take this a step</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="8.65">further we can see that three years</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="5.67">later after this report came out even</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="3.87">though there is still no prosecutions or</text>
  <text start="418.51" dur="5.04">no charges against the Fed that they</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="4.68">were leaking information a new report by</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="4.38">the University of Chicago Booth School</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="5.94">of Business PhD candidate david finer</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="5.1">has exposed the feds clear manipulation</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="6.57">and rigging of financial markets through</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="9.27">leaked information now finer found a</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="6.39">jump in New York City Taxi Camp activity</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="4.5">between the Federal Reserve Bank of New</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="5.16">York and major Wall Street banks around</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="4.95">the time of central bank policy meetings</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="4.619">now this is how they were passing</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="4.199">information around</text>
  <text start="453.969" dur="5.48">this way it can&amp;#39;t be tracked using</text>
  <text start="455.949" dur="6.661">phones emails or anything like that and</text>
  <text start="459.449" dur="5.68">the study&amp;#39;s author says the findings</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="5.069">suggest an increase in informal</text>
  <text start="465.129" dur="5.16">communications between fed employees and</text>
  <text start="467.679" dur="4.35">individuals in the private sector could</text>
  <text start="470.289" dur="3.571">be occurring now mr. finer used</text>
  <text start="472.029" dur="3.9">government-provided GPS coordinates</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="5.099">vehicle information and other travel</text>
  <text start="475.929" dur="5.46">data to track taxi traffic between the</text>
  <text start="478.959" dur="5.82">addresses of the New York Fed and major</text>
  <text start="481.389" dur="6.06">banks his research pointed to increased</text>
  <text start="484.779" dur="5.19">traffic between the destinations around</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="5.19">lunch and late evening hours which</text>
  <text start="489.969" dur="5.94">suggests informal meetings were taking</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="6.36">place and it was between all the banks</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="6.05">and the central bank and he showed the</text>
  <text start="498.999" dur="5.6">patterns when they were coming out with</text>
  <text start="501.959" dur="6.61">information actually right before that</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="6.7">now again what was said what was passed</text>
  <text start="508.569" dur="4.801">along we don&amp;#39;t know that as of yet I</text>
  <text start="511.299" dur="4.02">mean if they sent an email if they were</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="4.709">doing it over the phone that could be</text>
  <text start="515.319" dur="6.15">intercepted that could be deciphered but</text>
  <text start="518.079" dur="6.15">this cannot be what they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="521.469" dur="4.531">is something definitely changed now we</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="4.011">need to go back in time a little bit and</text>
  <text start="526" dur="4.8">we need to remember that last year</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="4.51">richmond while the former richmond Fed</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="4.5">president Jeffrey Lacker he stepped down</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="5.1">after revealing he had accidentally</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="4.86">confirmed sensitive information about a</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="3.989">Fed bond buying program to a financial</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="4.77">information firm and then failed to</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="5.071">report the disclosure well he he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="544.93" dur="6.69">accidentally do it he got caught doing</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="7.5">it because we see this is what the Fed</text>
  <text start="551.62" dur="7.079">does the central banks they are</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="8.489">intertwined with the banking system with</text>
  <text start="558.699" dur="6.661">Wall Street and they&amp;#39;re very slick in</text>
  <text start="562.899" dur="6.06">the way they communicate between each</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="5.94">other because if it was ever found out</text>
  <text start="568.959" dur="4.261">that they were actually giving</text>
  <text start="571.3" dur="4.86">information and they were leaking</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="4.799">information well this would be a really</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="4.919">bad spot the central bank would be in</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="4.5">and we can see right now with these</text>
  <text start="581.079" dur="3.271">studies that are coming out in these</text>
  <text start="582.519" dur="3.66">reports and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="2.909">of these because what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="586.179" dur="1.411">be doing is they&amp;#39;re going to be building</text>
  <text start="587.259" dur="3.031">this</text>
  <text start="587.59" dur="5.01">case of what the Fed has been doing now</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="6.38">this is gonna go a lot deeper because</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="7.92">once this audit bill is passed</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="7.03">it&amp;#39;s going to be game over for the Fed</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="7.29">and I believe this is why they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="603.7" dur="7.65">this audit the Fed and adding it as an</text>
  <text start="607.81" dur="6.57">amendment to another bill this way it</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="5.34">can be pushed through and Trump will</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="5.97">then sign it then they&amp;#39;ll have an</text>
  <text start="616.69" dur="5.19">outside or a government agency which I</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="4.2">believe I think it should be an outside</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="4.62">agency but let the inner government</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="5.88">agency go ahead and take a look at it</text>
  <text start="626.5" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re going to find things that we</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="5.24">always assumed was happening and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="6.69">going to come to light that yes the Fed</text>
  <text start="635.67" dur="6.09">manipulates the market the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="639.34" dur="4.98">creating currency out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="4.9">propping up the banking system and</text>
  <text start="644.32" dur="5.27">certain Wall Street types they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="6.81">doing a lot of illegal activity and</text>
  <text start="649.59" dur="6.55">we&amp;#39;re going to find out that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="5.88">need the central bank anymore and this</text>
  <text start="656.14" dur="5.43">is the whole point Trump has already</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="4.62">alluded to this queue has already</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="4.29">alluded to this he has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="7.05">hanging on the wall of the White House</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="8.07">and we already know that you need to cut</text>
  <text start="671.02" dur="6.11">off the source of the deep state and</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="6.45">that is the central banking system and</text>
  <text start="677.13" dur="5.23">again this is the IMF this is the biz</text>
  <text start="680.38" dur="3.57">this is the Fed this is all of it it</text>
  <text start="682.36" dur="4.98">leads all the way up to the Ross trials</text>
  <text start="683.95" dur="5.76">and they&amp;#39;re the ones who created this</text>
  <text start="687.34" dur="4.62">monstrosity because they understood</text>
