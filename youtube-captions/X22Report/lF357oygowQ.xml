  <text start="362.059" dur="7.02">economy down before the 2020 election</text>
  <text start="364.959" dur="6.24">because impeachment failed everything</text>

  <text start="433.72" dur="7.12">establishment they control the market</text>
  <text start="437.949" dur="5.921">you can manipulate the statistics and</text>
  <text start="440.84" dur="8.22">you can keep this system moving along if</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="8.299">you cut rates and add stimulus they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="6.54">been doing it for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="6.37">the mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="455.6" dur="5.51">central banks they don&amp;#39;t want Trump to</text>
  <text start="458.539" dur="6.241">get to that point because if he does</text>

  <text start="498.86" dur="6.75">recession it is not going to happen not</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="6.03">before the 2020 elections think about it</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="6">go back in time remember when we had</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="5.659">individuals out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="4.739">the housing market was going to crash</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="4.181">Peter Schiff was out there saying yes</text>
  <text start="516.349" dur="5.161">we&amp;#39;re going to have a credit freeze and</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="4.769">this was prior to 2008 back then the</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="2.49">mainstream media said impossible it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="2.611">then we&amp;#39;re going to happen the central</text>
  <text start="524" dur="3.93">bank you&amp;#39;re out of your mind we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="525.65" dur="4.32">forecasting any type of recession</text>
  <text start="527.93" dur="5.63">anytime soon and they said it in the</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="3.59">year that it actually happened</text>
  <text start="534.59" dur="5.07">why were they talking about the complete</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="3.74">opposite of what Peter Schiff was</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.29">talking about and many other individuals</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="4.989">because they didn&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="543.95" dur="5.97">understand and to know what was really</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="6.631">going on well we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="6.87">exact thing but it&amp;#39;s in Reverse it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="6.5">opposite I should say we&amp;#39;re now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="7.67">calling for a recession and they know</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="7.69">that if the central bank continues with</text>
  <text start="564.46" dur="4.87">stimulus they turn it back on turn the</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="4.29">spigots back on and they cut the rates</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="4.62">they know that this is not own to happen</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="5.31">remember whatever they tell you it is</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="5.43">always the opposite now Trump has been</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="4.26">dealing with China and all those people</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="4.17">who allow the u.s. to go down the path</text>
  <text start="581.21" dur="5.6">of no return they&amp;#39;re trying to direct</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="5.91">Trump on how to deal with China remember</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="6.31">we&amp;#39;re in a deep state central bank</text>
