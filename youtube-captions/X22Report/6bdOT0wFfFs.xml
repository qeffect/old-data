  <text start="35.75" dur="7.2">is episode 983 and today&amp;#39;s date is made</text>
  <text start="39.17" dur="5.96">29 2016 and total the episode is the</text>
  <text start="42.95" dur="4.77">current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="45.13" dur="4.54">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.72" dur="3.78">collapse news now in the past couple</text>
  <text start="49.67" dur="3.69">days the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="51.5" dur="6.27">there been doing whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="53.36" dur="6.75">can to push this economy up to make it</text>
  <text start="57.77" dur="4.5">look like it is doing much much better</text>
  <text start="60.11" dur="3.66">than it really is I mean they manipulate</text>
  <text start="62.27" dur="4.62">the stock market there was news about</text>
  <text start="63.77" dur="6.08">the Fed about their rate hike gdp was</text>
  <text start="66.89" dur="6.29">revised housing numbers came out and</text>
  <text start="69.85" dur="5.5">everyone believes that everything is</text>
  <text start="73.18" dur="4.719">doing much much better than it really is</text>
  <text start="75.35" dur="5.4">and I need to continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="77.899" dur="5.131">information but when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="80.75" dur="4.05">the numbers and we look at housing we</text>
  <text start="83.03" dur="5.07">look at manufacturing we look at retail</text>
  <text start="84.8" dur="4.65">we realize that what they&amp;#39;re saying and</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="3.48">what&amp;#39;s really happening are two</text>
  <text start="89.45" dur="3.9">different things for example i talked</text>
  <text start="91.58" dur="5.73">about housing quite a bit and housing</text>
  <text start="93.35" dur="6.03">shows the power and the ability of the</text>
  <text start="97.31" dur="5.34">people to go out and make purchases</text>
  <text start="99.38" dur="5.46">where they have the down payments where</text>
  <text start="102.65" dur="6.74">they have the money to make the mortgage</text>
  <text start="104.84" dur="6.93">payments and right now the u.s. person</text>
  <text start="109.39" dur="4.6">they&amp;#39;re sitting on the sidelines right</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="4.529">now they&amp;#39;re not making the purchase they</text>
  <text start="113.99" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="116.299" dur="6.061">savings and most of them are very</text>
  <text start="119.45" dur="4.739">nervous about continually keeping their</text>
  <text start="122.36" dur="4.649">jobs because they&amp;#39;re seen layoffs all</text>
  <text start="124.189" dur="4.29">around them and we start to look around</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="4.171">and we see housing in many different</text>
  <text start="128.479" dur="4.741">areas and we see that the prices are</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="6.119">starting to come down the markets are</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="8.22">starting to cool off and this is very</text>
  <text start="137.299" dur="6.78">very evident in Miami actually the</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="5.67">bubble is starting to pop in Miami in</text>
  <text start="144.079" dur="5.791">the luxury condo market and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="5.01">seeing is there is about 3397</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.85">condominiums available in the downtown</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="5.01">Miami area and the current prices it</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="4.98">estimates that it would take about</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="5.97">twenty nine months to sell those we see</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="3.84">South American investors they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.1" dur="4.919">unloading their recent</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="5.25">I build condos because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="5.25">them actually the ones that are in</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="6.96">contract with their dumping and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="10.651">adding about 8,000 units that are still</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="8.879">under construction to the inventory now</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="5.519">purchases from January through April</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="5.58">fell by twenty-five percent the problem</text>
  <text start="189.439" dur="5.121">is that investors they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="5.7">buying there they&amp;#39;re looking to sell</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="5.59">foreign investors they have to dig into</text>
  <text start="196.909" dur="4.681">their pockets to subsidize the rents now</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="5.519">when they start doing this this is a</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="6.36">major major problem and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.669" dur="3.871">seeing out in Miami and this is starting</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="4.59">to happen in many different markets</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="4.71">around the country is that the price is</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="4.89">that people are trying to sell their</text>
  <text start="214.25" dur="5.579">condos at are a lot higher because</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed a thing to</text>
  <text start="219.829" dur="7.41">thinking that I can get this type of</text>
  <text start="223.609" dur="5.31">money we saw this happen prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="4.201">where people were still out there</text>
  <text start="228.919" dur="5.731">selling houses condos whatever they had</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="4.139">and the prices were in very inflated and</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="3.179">what they were doing is they were</text>
  <text start="235.579" dur="4.38">chasing the market down this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.829" dur="5.49">happening in Miami right now I&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="6.12">you an example in sunny isles down in</text>
  <text start="243.319" dur="5.971">Florida people are trying to get 1.13</text>
  <text start="246.079" dur="7.44">million but nobody wants to pay that</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="6.539">these places have come down by twenty</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="3.601">seven thousand dollars already there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.829" dur="4.47">another one that was trying to get one</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="5.039">point nine nine five million they have</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="5.821">come down almost a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="262.159" dur="7.051">dollars in price and it goes on and on</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="4.62">there was one for 565,000 they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="6.75">down thirty three thousand dollars in</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="7.35">price 14 570,000 they&amp;#39;ve come thirty</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="5.28">four thousand dollars down in price and</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="5.79">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is the market</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="4.859">has topped off the bubbles they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="3.599">reached the top they&amp;#39;re starting to come</text>
  <text start="286.099" dur="4.471">down and I&amp;#39;m not just seeing this in</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="5.401">Miami I am seeing this all over the</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="4.62">place where prices are continually</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="4.99">coming down and outside of the cities</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="5.04">the prices are dropping rapidly</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="5.34">so we&amp;#39;re seeing the beginning stages of</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="4.57">this bubble starting to burst and this</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="3.78">is why the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="3.81">are pushing so hard to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="3.66">that everything is fine they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="3.42">to convince everyone get in there get</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="3.45">into the market get into the house and</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="4.14">get but it&amp;#39;s not going to work they</text>
  <text start="314.1" dur="3.3">tried this back in 2008 telling us that</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="3.69">everything was contained that everything</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="4.32">was fine and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="4.47">that this markets going to come down and</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="5.16">the entire economy is going to crash and</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can really do about</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="5.16">it they can cover it up but they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="329.01" dur="4.68">be able to stop this crash and we know</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="4.08">that the private western central bankers</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="4.16">they realize that these economies around</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="4.26">the world are going to crash and</text>
  <text start="337.85" dur="5.11">governments are very nervous the central</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="5.63">bankers are nervous not in a way that</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re scared but they need to know</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="5.11">what the people are thinking they need</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="6.12">to know what people are talking about</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="5.76">they need to know information so they</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="5.22">can plan accordingly this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="6.03">been spying on everyone plus the people</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="5.94">are a threat to their authority now in</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="6.66">the Patriot Act we know that section 213</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="5.49">was included in the Patriot Act and we</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="4.8">can see that a lot of privacy advocates</text>
  <text start="371.46" dur="5.97">they were protesting against this but it</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="7.11">looks like 213 was put in there and what</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="7.86">213 is this is a sneak peek warrant</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="7.89">which allows law enforcement to go ahead</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="6.99">and spy on the people and we see right</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5.61">now from all the spying that the</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="5.07">government has done from everything</text>
  <text start="394.98" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us this is all</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="5.22">about terrorists this is all about</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="6.11">finding the terrorists well we have a</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="6.36">report and this is from the government</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="6.9">detailing the number of sneak peak warns</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="8.52">and what do they reveal well out of</text>
  <text start="412.52" dur="9.43">11,000 sneak peek requests only 51 were</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="8.19">used for terrorism what does that tell</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="7.32">you it tells you they&amp;#39;re not going after</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="6.23">terrorists it tells you they are spying</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="5.6">on the people</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="5.259">now the government is going to</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="6.099">dramatically expand surveillance powers</text>
  <text start="437.129" dur="5.97">unless Congress does something last</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="4.891">month at the request the Department of</text>
  <text start="443.099" dur="5.611">Justice the courts approved changes to</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="5.639">rule 41 of the federal rules of Criminal</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="6.299">Procedure which governs search and</text>
  <text start="451.499" dur="5.82">seizure by the nature of this obscure</text>
  <text start="455.009" dur="5.701">bureaucratic process these rules become</text>
  <text start="457.319" dur="8.25">law unless Congress rejects the changes</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="7.289">before december first of 2016 the second</text>
  <text start="465.569" dur="4.71">part of the change to rule 41 would give</text>
  <text start="467.999" dur="3.81">a magistrate judge the authority to</text>
  <text start="470.279" dur="4.681">issue a single warrant that would</text>
  <text start="471.809" dur="6.271">authorize a search of unlimited number</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="5.489">or maybe thousands or millions of</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="4.859">devices located anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="480.449" dur="4.5">and we discussed this before so what we</text>
  <text start="482.939" dur="3.81">see right now is Congress is sitting</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="6.33">there and they need to do something</text>
  <text start="486.749" dur="6.84">before december first and we see that</text>
  <text start="491.279" dur="5.37">the US government central bankers from</text>
  <text start="493.589" dur="6.42">their own information they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="496.649" dur="7.89">looking for terrorists they&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="500.009" dur="7.25">every day people because the terrorists</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="6.69">are the government the terrorists are</text>
  <text start="507.259" dur="7.39">their agencies that create these events</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="5.55">to make us think that we need to remove</text>
  <text start="514.649" dur="4.62">our rights we need the government to</text>
  <text start="516.779" dur="5.01">keep us safe we need the government to</text>
  <text start="519.269" dur="6.3">protect us but this is all fake phony</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="5.971">and false this is not true and this is</text>
  <text start="525.569" dur="4.32">why each and every one of us needs to</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="5.939">protect our electronic data just like we</text>
  <text start="529.889" dur="6.861">protect our physical information we need</text>
  <text start="533.699" dur="5.431">to use encryption anyway we possibly can</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="4.48">we need to protect our devices from</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="4.68">tracking like you can use like block it</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="4.71">pocket calm where its leaves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.81" dur="4.44">into over with metals they block the</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="3.93">signal you can get them for your credit</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="7.199">cards you can get them for whatever you</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="7.5">need it blocks the signal encryption for</text>
  <text start="555.449" dur="5.671">your email makes it so the government</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="8.34">can&amp;#39;t read the email and there are many</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="6.48">services that provide this on my site</text>
  <text start="565.71" dur="4.47">the right-hand side someone created this</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="5.37">little encryption algorithm you can</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="5.07">encrypt your message take that message</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="4.86">put it in the email make sure the person</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="6.15">has the key and this way nobody can read</text>
  <text start="577.83" dur="5.46">what is going on here but there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="581.4" dur="3.6">ways we can do this now are they</text>
  <text start="583.29" dur="3.93">completely foolproof now we know that</text>
  <text start="585" dur="6.69">locking your house isn&amp;#39;t completely</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="8.1">foolproof but you do it because there is</text>
  <text start="591.69" dur="6.96">some sort of protection when you do this</text>
  <text start="595.32" dur="5.13">it makes it harder for criminals it</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="3.81">makes it harder for the government and</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="5.88">this is what we need to continually do</text>
  <text start="602.46" dur="7.5">we need to continually push back now out</text>
  <text start="606.33" dur="6.51">in the UK we know that they&amp;#39;re voting on</text>
  <text start="609.96" dur="5.34">this EU referendum and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="612.84" dur="4.71">interesting about this is that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="5.13">report out there about plans to form an</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="5.4">EU army which we talked about many times</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="4.68">and the blueprint is apparently being</text>
  <text start="622.95" dur="5.37">drawn up by Brussels and is being kept</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="6.21">from the UK voters until after the 23rd</text>
  <text start="628.32" dur="5.76">of June after the referendum now the</text>
  <text start="631.32" dur="4.83">plan includes your new European military</text>
  <text start="634.08" dur="6.9">and operational structures and the e use</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="11.78">foreign policy we see from NATO mi5 mi6</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="11.07">they&amp;#39;ve all said that the UK cannot exit</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="7.21">because of national security however</text>
  <text start="652.05" dur="5.97">former defense secretary Liam Fox claim</text>
  <text start="655.14" dur="6.75">that a leave vote would be the UK&amp;#39;s last</text>
  <text start="658.02" dur="7.53">chance to be dragged into a permanent EU</text>
  <text start="661.89" dur="5.61">army so we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="665.55" dur="6.9">government is holding certain things</text>
  <text start="667.5" dur="8.13">back not telling the people and we know</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="5.13">that they&amp;#39;re creating this EU type of</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="4.59">armed forces which is not controlled by</text>
  <text start="677.58" dur="5.58">any of the government or any of the</text>
  <text start="680.22" dur="7.68">countries it&amp;#39;s going to be controlled by</text>
  <text start="683.16" dur="7.14">a non-elected system and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="687.9" dur="5.16">remove the sovereignty and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="690.3" dur="6.15">control all the countries by using this</text>
  <text start="693.06" dur="6.21">one force now President Putin is out</text>
  <text start="696.45" dur="5.16">there and he says the u.s. is a row</text>

  <text start="709.23" dur="6.54">Poland missile systems throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="711.96" dur="6.27">and he&amp;#39;s saying that what are these why</text>

  <text start="725.64" dur="5.25">replaced with missiles with a thousand</text>
  <text start="727.65" dur="5.04">kilometers now in the beginning the US</text>
  <text start="730.89" dur="4.26">was out there saying oh we need these</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="6.26">missile systems because of a ram but</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="7.98">Putin is out there saying well the US</text>

  <text start="762.42" dur="4.92">all these military assets all around the</text>
  <text start="764.52" dur="5.52">area because they&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="767.34" dur="4.74">World War three they have these plans in</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="5.78">their heads where they believe that if</text>
  <text start="772.08" dur="7.05">they have a first strike against Russia</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="4.72">will come out the winning side now of</text>
  <text start="779.13" dur="4.95">course we know what Rush is going to do</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="5.43">now Russia is going to say ok there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.08" dur="4.02">missiles right at our doorstep we have</text>
  <text start="785.97" dur="4.14">to protect ourselves the US would do the</text>
  <text start="788.1" dur="4.95">same thing if Russia took missile</text>
  <text start="790.11" dur="5.82">systems and put them in Canada put them</text>
  <text start="793.05" dur="7.47">in Mexico put him in Cuba what would the</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="7.98">u.s. do they would protect you the US</text>
  <text start="800.52" dur="6.69">would protect itself they would question</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="6.57">why are all these missile systems right</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="5.7">up to our borders something is going on</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="5.4">here Russia&amp;#39;s doing the same thing right</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="5.28">now now the u.s. they have halted</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="5.6">cluster bomb deliveries to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="818.19" dur="6.35">why because a human rights organization</text>
  <text start="821.48" dur="6.55">kept on pressing the United States</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="6.69">asking why are you selling cluster bombs</text>
  <text start="828.03" dur="6.06">because they&amp;#39;re using them in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="831.23" dur="4.96">finally the US has said okay we need to</text>
  <text start="834.09" dur="5.97">put a stop to this because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="6.12">found out here but the UK they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.06" dur="5.63">selling record quantity of arms</text>
  <text start="842.31" dur="5.82">including missiles bombs grenades to</text>
  <text start="845.69" dur="6.16">many different countries that have</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="5.51">dubious human right records many have</text>
  <text start="851.85" dur="4.74">been accused of war crimes and</text>
  <text start="853.64" dur="5.89">suppressing popular protests like Saudi</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="7.29">Arabia Baja Rainbow run day Maldives and</text>
  <text start="859.53" dur="6.32">many many more so we can see that the</text>
  <text start="863.88" dur="4.35">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="865.85" dur="4.39">they don&amp;#39;t care about the people they</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t care about the rights of the</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="7.11">people they don&amp;#39;t care about freedom</text>
  <text start="872.61" dur="9.09">democracy they care about control once</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="6.54">they have a government in power they</text>
  <text start="881.7" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t care what the people want think or</text>
  <text start="883.89" dur="5.97">do as long as they can keep control any</text>
  <text start="887.76" dur="4.08">way possible when they&amp;#39;re on the other</text>
  <text start="889.86" dur="3.75">end and they want to remove a government</text>
  <text start="891.84" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re all behind the people freedom</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="6.06">democracy and you can see it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="896.31" dur="8.03">complete double standard here now we</text>
  <text start="899.67" dur="8.36">realize out in Iraq the Iraqi forces are</text>
  <text start="904.34" dur="6.73">making a huge offensive into Fallujah</text>
  <text start="908.03" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="911.07" dur="4.2">state there and what they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="4.44">realize is that eighty percent of the</text>
  <text start="915.27" dur="5.91">Islamic say terrorists that have been</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="5.55">killed in Fallujah they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="921.18" dur="4.56">foreign fighters from all over the place</text>
  <text start="923.28" dur="6.87">and this is front coming from Iraq&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="6.27">I&amp;#39;ll Nick heel news agency he says we</text>
  <text start="930.15" dur="4.44">are fighting government&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="5.04">fighting a terrorist group because all</text>
  <text start="934.59" dur="6.03">of these fighters have links to Israel</text>
  <text start="937.05" dur="6.32">Saudi Arabia the United States he guess</text>
  <text start="940.62" dur="7.62">so in fact we are actually fighting</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="6.79">different governments on our own land we</text>
  <text start="948.24" dur="4.92">see the Islamic state they are on the</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="4.68">move right now u.s. warplanes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="953.16" dur="3.12">providing cover for the Islamic state as</text>
  <text start="954.84" dur="3.51">we know they&amp;#39;re providing cover for al</text>
  <text start="956.28" dur="4.98">Qaeda al doosra all the terrorists and</text>
  <text start="958.35" dur="6.929">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="961.26" dur="7.949">US with the coalition force help</text>
  <text start="965.279" dur="8.16">moving these terrorist groups from raka</text>
  <text start="969.209" dur="8.19">to Deir Ezzor and homes because they</text>
  <text start="973.439" dur="6.541">want to preserve the revenue from the</text>
  <text start="977.399" dur="5.521">oil smuggling operations and we realize</text>
  <text start="979.98" dur="5.219">that Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="982.92" dur="4.109">into raka right now so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="985.199" dur="4.56">right now is that the US and coalition</text>
  <text start="987.029" dur="4.47">forces they are still providing air</text>
  <text start="989.759" dur="3.24">cover for all the terrorist groups for</text>
  <text start="991.499" dur="2.731">the Free Syrian Army that morphs back</text>
  <text start="992.999" dur="4.56">and forth into these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="994.23" dur="6.089">and we see at this point that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="997.559" dur="5.851">really not going after any of these</text>
  <text start="1000.319" dur="4.83">terrorist groups their goal is still the</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="4.89">same this is why they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1005.149" dur="4.891">join the forces of Russia going after</text>
  <text start="1008.3" dur="4.079">the terrorists and Russia continually</text>
  <text start="1010.04" dur="4.32">extends its hand saying please join us</text>
  <text start="1012.379" dur="4.981">please join us and every time the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1014.36" dur="5.61">objects it gives us more and more proof</text>
  <text start="1017.36" dur="4.62">that the u.s. their goal is not to get</text>
  <text start="1019.97" dur="4.26">terrorists their goal is to support the</text>
  <text start="1021.98" dur="3.839">terrorists and go after Assad and</text>
  <text start="1024.23" dur="4.709">eventually what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1025.819" dur="5.49">is their main goal is most likely not</text>
  <text start="1028.939" dur="4.831">Assad at this point but to try to start</text>
  <text start="1031.309" dur="5.52">World War three we can see this by the</text>
  <text start="1033.77" dur="6.21">US forces inside Syria we see them</text>

  <text start="1044.809" dur="5.581">established over time a little at a time</text>
  <text start="1047.03" dur="6">and all of this is going to continue on</text>
