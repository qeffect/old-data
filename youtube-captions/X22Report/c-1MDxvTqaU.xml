  <text start="206.53" dur="5.92">get it into the mainstream media to push</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="6.03">fear it was called operation yellow</text>

  <text start="241.85" dur="5.31">normal everyday leak or do you think it</text>
  <text start="243.77" dur="5.04">was done on purpose to spread fear to</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="3.12">get the people to say you know what we</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="3.09">better not do this look at this there</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="3.69">was a document hidden within the</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="4.44">government it was leaked out and now we</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="5.1">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen this is</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="3.53">exactly what they wanted to happen but</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="4.74">guess what</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="7.17">Boris Johnson Trump they&amp;#39;re both working</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="6.51">together and this will not happen</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re pushing fear to gain control of</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="6.599">the economic narrative but the Patriots</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="5.89">they are taking the economy back now</text>
  <text start="276.919" dur="4.141">here in the United States what are they</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="6.75">doing well as we discussed on Friday</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="7.17">they are pushing a recession all the</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="4.68">mainstream media outlets they are on the</text>
  <text start="288.23" dur="3.96">same page and they&amp;#39;re all getting the</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="4.47">four am talking points and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="4.14">pushing the same exact narrative now out</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="4.199">of the New York Times</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="6.989">they pushed an article saying how the</text>
  <text start="298.879" dur="5.91">recession of 2020 could happen now this</text>
  <text start="303.319" dur="3.511">is what how this article reason I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="3.72">read the first part here the United</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="3.899">States almost certainly isn&amp;#39;t in a</text>
  <text start="308.509" dur="4.351">recession right now it may well avoid</text>
  <text start="310.729" dur="3.75">one for the foreseeable future but the</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="3.39">chances that the nation will fall into</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="4.351">recession have increased sharply in the</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="4.02">last two weeks this is the unmistakable</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="3.54">message that the global investors in the</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="4.139">bond market are sending longer-term</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="4.139">interest rates have plunged since the</text>
  <text start="324.409" dur="4.41">end of July a shift that historically</text>
  <text start="326.509" dur="4.65">tends to predict slower growth interest</text>
  <text start="328.819" dur="4.171">rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and a</text>
  <text start="331.159" dur="6.301">heightened risk that the economy slips</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="8.7">into outright contradiction so by the</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="7.079">Fed cutting interest rates and the way</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="6.379">the economy looks we could be entering a</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="6.93">recession but we&amp;#39;re down in a recession</text>
  <text start="348.069" dur="5.981">they&amp;#39;re building this up for the 2020</text>
  <text start="351.469" dur="6.031">let&amp;#39;s remember their entire plan was to</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="7.14">push the entire economic system into a</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="6.93">recession in 2020 this is why the plan</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="7.62">was to raise the rates very very slowly</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="7.26">throughout the year of 2019 and that</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="5.49">didn&amp;#39;t work now think about this now</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that rate cuts that is</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="4.32">the problem and that will cause the</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="5.789">recession but raising the rates doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="5.13">cause the recession see they have it the</text>
  <text start="381.529" dur="6.211">opposite way actually raising the rates</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="6.27">that is what causes the recession then</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="6.539">the Fed lowers the rates very very</text>
  <text start="390.02" dur="7.889">quickly because they already pushed the</text>
  <text start="394.279" dur="5.64">economy over the cliff and everything</text>
  <text start="397.909" dur="4.32">starts to rapidly fall apart Trump in</text>
  <text start="399.919" dur="5.671">the Patriots they stopped this before</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="7.231">this happened and by the way Trump is</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="7.41">not working on a salary he is in the</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="6.329">presidential position and he donates 100</text>
  <text start="413" dur="6.15">percent of his salary back to the</text>
  <text start="415.789" dur="5.701">country and he gives it to different</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="5.85">organizations I think the latest was the</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="6.06">Surgeon General and he does this because</text>
  <text start="425" dur="4.889">he believes in this company in this</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.709">country now he&amp;#39;s bringing</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="4.981">back jobs manufacturing and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="7.141">continually talking to different</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="7.169">business owners or CEOs of certain</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="5.099">corporations and Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="442.039" dur="4.981">following I&amp;#39;m having dinner tonight with</text>
  <text start="444.499" dur="6.561">Tim Cook of Apple they&amp;#39;ll be spending</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="8.13">vast sums of money in the u.s. great</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="6.9">because he knows that time is ticking</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.759">down he needs to bring back as many</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="5.829">companies manufacturers businesses back</text>
  <text start="460.909" dur="7.201">to the United States because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="6.84">building the people&amp;#39;s economy which is</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="5.399">parallel to the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="470.629" dur="5.01">back in the 70s actually prior to the</text>
  <text start="473.509" dur="4.141">70s it was the opposite way we had a</text>
  <text start="475.639" dur="6.3">gold back economy the people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="7.379">and they were building a fiat central</text>
  <text start="481.939" dur="5.88">bank economy at the same time Trump is</text>
  <text start="485.029" dur="5.871">just reversing this now I mean think</text>
  <text start="487.819" dur="6.21">about what the deep state has tried</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="5.079">they&amp;#39;ve tried everything but Trump he</text>
  <text start="494.029" dur="4.26">also tweeted out the following our</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="4.831">economy is the best in the world by far</text>

  <text start="500.81" dur="4.139">all categories poised for big growth</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="4.979">after trade deals are completed</text>
  <text start="504.949" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s very interesting poised for big</text>
  <text start="508.129" dur="5.191">growth after trade deals are completed</text>
  <text start="511.039" dur="4.86">once he gets rid of the globalist system</text>
  <text start="513.32" dur="5.07">and these terrible awful trade deals</text>
  <text start="515.899" dur="5.901">that are one-sided we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="7.05">incredible growth import prices down</text>

  <text start="525.44" dur="4.98">farmers from big tariffs money come in</text>
  <text start="527.029" dur="5.761">great future for us now think about what</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="3.96">the deep state tried now Trump is out</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="4.62">there and he&amp;#39;s giving the message that</text>

  <text start="549.05" dur="6.779">rates in 2016 2017 2018 and they</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="5.55">couldn&amp;#39;t do it in 2019 the Patriots</text>
  <text start="555.829" dur="6.301">reversed this they push the idea of</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="4.44">tariffs hurting the consumer turned out</text>
  <text start="562.13" dur="3.47">to be completely false</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="4.71">because we explained how tariffs work</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="6.54">tariffs do not hit the consumer what</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="7.05">happens is the first middleman in China</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="6.46">they get hit with the tariffs now that</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="7.05">product that is being bought by the</text>

  <text start="581.99" dur="6.42">40 cents the tariffs are on that amount</text>
  <text start="586.15" dur="4.6">then it goes to the next middleman the</text>
  <text start="588.41" dur="5.25">next middleman and they eat that right</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="5.16">there and the tariffs aren&amp;#39;t as big as</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="3.69">everyone thinks they are yes with the</text>
  <text start="595.91" dur="5.13">amount of products coming through</text>
