  <text start="106.88" dur="4.95">financial news now we understand that</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="4.08">the central banks they are very nervous</text>
  <text start="111.83" dur="4.23">about cryptocurrency we know the IMF is</text>
  <text start="113.72" dur="3.54">out there saying we need regulation we</text>
  <text start="116.06" dur="4.23">know that they&amp;#39;ve been bringing the</text>
  <text start="117.26" dur="4.74">price down of Bitcoin by dumping like 50</text>
  <text start="120.29" dur="3.96">million a hundred million worth of</text>
  <text start="122" dur="4.68">cryptocurrency and they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="124.25" dur="4.44">people very very nervous about investing</text>
  <text start="126.68" dur="4.83">in cryptocurrency and the reason why</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a huge focus on cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="6.93">because they realize if the general</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="6.75">public wakes up and they realize the</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="5.13">power of cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s game over</text>
  <text start="141.41" dur="4.7">for the central bank because what you</text>
  <text start="143.57" dur="7.169">can do with this technology is basically</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="8.47">move into every single part of the</text>
  <text start="150.739" dur="6.151">banking industry and remove the banks</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="3.27">remove the central bank because really</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="5.159">if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="7.199">centralization that&amp;#39;s obsolete it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.049" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re done for the banking system as</text>
  <text start="165.049" dur="6.091">we know it today is pretty much done for</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="4.201">and the way everything works is about</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="4.349">the change it&amp;#39;s almost like when the</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="5.76">internet was first evolving when there</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="5.131">were stores coming online you are able</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="5.37">to do your banking online and because of</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="4.94">the internet you had smartphones and</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="3.69">then think about how smartphones</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="3.37">basically took</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="3.419">the next level the same thing is</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="4.86">happening with crypto currencies right</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="5.581">now yes we had the blockchain 1.0 the</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="4.949">blockchain now 2.0 and this will</text>
  <text start="196.04" dur="5.069">continually to evolve and before you</text>
  <text start="198.739" dur="4.53">know it it will overtake the banking</text>
  <text start="201.109" dur="4.74">system this is why they are so nervous</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="4.321">about the crypto market and this is why</text>
  <text start="205.849" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="5.459">you don&amp;#39;t want to have it and once that</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="5.039">great awakening starts to happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.049" dur="4.231">basically game over for the central</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="4.051">bankers and if you want to know more</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="3.51">about crypto currencies and you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="3.899">new to it just like the internet but the</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="4.589">internet was first evolving and you know</text>
  <text start="223.189" dur="3.181">we had a o L dial-up people were getting</text>
  <text start="225.379" dur="2.911">into it a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="4.41">understand you know what it was why do</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="5.43">we need it what what could it do what</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="5.909">technology would this push in the future</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="4.5">people didn&amp;#39;t realize how big this was</text>
  <text start="236.689" dur="3.38">going to get the same things happening</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="5.04">with cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s very very early</text>
  <text start="240.069" dur="6.551">on right now it&amp;#39;s in the early stages</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="5.159">and people don&amp;#39;t realize how much the</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="4.289">blockchain system can do now that</text>
  <text start="248.419" dur="4.801">central bankers they realize what this</text>
  <text start="250.909" dur="4.381">is capable of and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="3.6">shaking in their boots and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="3.3">mean that the central bankers they just</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="3.569">you know have given up they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="3.87">continually try to make it look like</text>
  <text start="260.389" dur="4.261">nobody should be using cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="3.9">at all and you&amp;#39;re gonna see these ups</text>
  <text start="264.65" dur="4.889">and downs and things like that because</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="5.82">again they have the ability to use free</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="4.021">money to buy up Bitcoin and to drop the</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="3.93">price and this is why you need to know</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="4.2">how to maneuver in and out of it and if</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="4.16">you want to learn about that you can</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="5.7">just go to the link x-22 report</text>
  <text start="280.27" dur="6.369">school.com I also have a banner on the</text>

  <text start="290.3" dur="4.47">in there cryptos a crypto cowboy and</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="5.43">many others I&amp;#39;m in there learning you</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="4.35">watch them and you watch how they trade</text>
  <text start="297.409" dur="3.781">they pick different cryptocurrencies and</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="3.39">they tell you this is why we think this</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="3.719">one&amp;#39;s gonna go up this is why you need</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="5.189">to get out of this and you watch them do</text>
  <text start="304.909" dur="4.111">it and they show you what they are doing</text>
  <text start="307.699" dur="3.09">and you can just follow along it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="5.13">entertainment room where you&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="310.789" dur="5.731">them make moves and you can do what</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re doing and make a profit a lot of</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="4.23">people in there are making profits and a</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="2.91">lot of people are worried about</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="3.06">you know what do I do with the</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="3.63">cryptocurrency what happens if I want to</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="6.26">cash out do I have to go into dollars</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="6.92">well they have the ability to take your</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="6.58">cryptocurrency and you can basically</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="6.28">cash out of it not into dollars but into</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.16">physical gold and they will actually</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="5.85">deliver it to you so you do have the</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="5.94">opportunity to cash out into gold</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="5.01">instead of dollars and all you need to</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="4.89">do is go over to X 20 to report school</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="4.41">comm you can learn all about it you can</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="4.5">you know ask questions and things like</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="5.52">that again I am in the trading room I am</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="5.64">listening every day to what goes on what</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="4.85">trades they are making and again this is</text>
  <text start="362.78" dur="4.65">about our freedom this is about</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="5.23">separating ourselves from the central</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="5.07">bankers waking more people up to</text>
  <text start="369.98" dur="4.32">understand and realize that there is</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="4.169">something else out there</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="4.14">instead of being enslaved to the central</text>
  <text start="376.669" dur="4.261">banks instead of using the Federal</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="6">Reserve Note we need to wake a lot more</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="4.76">people up to move away from the central</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="5.22">banking system and I said this before</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="6.729">Trump does have Andrew Jackson hanging</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="5.25">on his wall in the White House and I</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="4.771">believe one of his last moves out of all</text>
  <text start="394.91" dur="4.71">of this that he is doing right now is to</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="3.78">basically move away from the central</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="3.9">banking system and I think he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="400.97" dur="4.11">with China and Russia to do this just</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="4.59">like he&amp;#39;s been working with Russia and</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="5.37">China in North Korea in Syria and Iran I</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="4.559">believe he&amp;#39;s going to make this move at</text>
  <text start="410.45" dur="4.23">the very end when everything starts to</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="3.991">fall apart now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="3.84">we are seeing that everything is</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="4.71">starting to break apart and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="6.03">about the economy right now and Morgan</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="6.54">staling they warned that the credit</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="5.79">cycle is on its last legs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="4.11">saying that in their view a key driver</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="4.02">is simply that global liquidity</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="4.08">conditions are tightening and markets</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="4.26">are coming to a realization that the</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="4.319">process will be rocky rising funding</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="4.47">stretches weaker flows weaker trading</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="5.25">liquidity higher volatility this is</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="5.61">arguably what quantitative tightening</text>
  <text start="445.669" dur="4.591">feels like and in their view these</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="3.57">dynamics will continue to pressure</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="4.05">credit spreads over the course of the</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="4.38">year now Morgan Stan</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="4.8">we concluded that the evidence is</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="5.04">mounting that spreads have hit cycle</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="4.83">tights in other words that bigger</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="4.77">fundamental challenges in credit are six</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="4.98">to twelve months away not two to three</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.37">years down the road so they&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="5.7">towards us much much quicker than anyone</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="4.59">thinks now Bank of America chief</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="4.89">investment strategist Michael Hartnett</text>
  <text start="476.42" dur="7.38">is also pointing out that the market is</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="6.54">late very late cycle not only that but</text>
  <text start="483.8" dur="5.19">based on annualized asset returns the</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="6.27">market now is most similar to what</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="6.78">happened well just before the financial</text>
  <text start="492.32" dur="6.36">crisis of 2008 and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="6.56">US yield curve well guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="7.01">inverted and every time we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="6.43">something really really bad happens now</text>
  <text start="505.69" dur="4.84">what&amp;#39;s very interesting if we go back in</text>
  <text start="508.76" dur="4.68">time Bernanke was out there in the year</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="4.86">of 2008 saying that we&amp;#39;re not predicting</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="3.45">a recession anytime soon everything</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="4.62">looks good we have everything contained</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="520.01" dur="4.59">message where they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re not headed into a</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="4.11">recession everything is fine now of</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="3.51">course this is what they say when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="3.81">entering the recession or were already</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="5.01">in a recession and they said not to</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="5.7">worry because growth prospects look</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="4.32">pretty strong which is why the Fed is</text>
  <text start="538.22" dur="4.47">raising short-term interest rates and</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="5.49">they are out there saying that they are</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="5.79">raising the rates so they can flatten</text>
  <text start="545.21" dur="5.55">the yield curve in addition they argued</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="4.02">the curve will likely steep and as the</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="4.11">US government runs a bigger deficit and</text>
  <text start="552.5" dur="4.53">issues more debt they said the Fed</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="5.07">policymakers reason that a bigger supply</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="4.95">of debt should put downward pressure on</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="5.43">the Treasury prices and deliver a</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="6.21">corresponding lift to yield so they want</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="5.37">more debt and they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="4.74">will fix the problem but we need to go</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="4.35">back to what we just talked about with</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="4.11">Morgan Stanley and Bank of America where</text>
  <text start="575.09" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re seeing the credit cycle is on</text>
  <text start="577.04" dur="4.8">its last legs now as we add more debt</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="4.83">there are more and more countries out</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="4.86">there saying listen you can&amp;#39;t sustain</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="3.06">this this is not going to be good we</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="4.17">the dollar anymore anymore actually</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="4.68">seeing that we can&amp;#39;t trust the Treasury</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="3.18">bonds right now that&amp;#39;s why there are</text>
  <text start="593.84" dur="4.05">countries that are dumping the</text>
  <text start="595.16" dur="5.19">Treasuries or put a halt to purchasing</text>
  <text start="597.89" dur="5.25">Treasury bonds so when we start to look</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="4.5">at this we say hmm what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="3.78">and we see a lot of countries out there</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="3.96">saying you know something we would like</text>
  <text start="606.92" dur="3.33">our gold back and the only reason</text>
  <text start="608.81" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re asking for their gold back is</text>
  <text start="610.25" dur="4.8">because they don&amp;#39;t trust the dollar and</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="4.44">eventually they&amp;#39;re going to ditch the</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="5.1">dollar and move to another currency and</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="5.79">we already see Venezuela Germany Austria</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="8.04">Austria Netherlands and other countries</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="7.38">asking for their gold back and now</text>
  <text start="628.19" dur="4.89">Turkey has also announced that it has</text>

  <text start="648.44" dur="5.49">taken a tough stance against the US</text>
  <text start="651.08" dur="4.11">currency criticized dollar loans and</text>
  <text start="653.93" dur="5.82">saying that the international loans</text>
  <text start="655.19" dur="6.84">should be given in gold instead Iran</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="4.8">said why do we make all loans in dollars</text>
  <text start="662.03" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s use another currency he went on to</text>
  <text start="664.55" dur="6.12">say I suggest that loans should be made</text>
  <text start="666.56" dur="6.84">based on gold with the dollar the world</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="4.8">is always under exchange rate pressure</text>
  <text start="673.4" dur="4.439">we should have states and nations from</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="3.75">this exchange rate pressure gold has</text>
  <text start="677.839" dur="4.711">never been a tool of oppression</text>
  <text start="679.22" dur="5.7">throughout history so countries are</text>
  <text start="682.55" dur="3.539">already out there saying let&amp;#39;s move away</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="3.21">from the dollar</text>
  <text start="686.089" dur="3">we know China&amp;#39;s doing it we know then as</text>
  <text start="688.13" dur="3.42">well is doing it</text>
  <text start="689.089" dur="4.831">we know Russia is doing it Turkey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="4.47">looking to do it Iran is doing it</text>
  <text start="693.92" dur="5.039">Syria&amp;#39;s doing it there are many other</text>
  <text start="696.02" dur="3.48">countries that are moving towards the</text>
  <text start="698.959" dur="3">east</text>
  <text start="699.5" dur="5.51">and away from the west because they</text>
  <text start="701.959" dur="7.531">realize that the Full Faith Credit of</text>
  <text start="705.01" dur="6.97">the dollar is not there anymore because</text>
  <text start="709.49" dur="5.27">the amount of debt and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="711.98" dur="5.58">today it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="714.76" dur="4.87">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="4.139">United States will end up defaulting</text>
  <text start="719.63" dur="5.629">because the amount of debt</text>
  <text start="721.699" dur="6.901">that is being created today is far above</text>
  <text start="725.259" dur="5.531">the amount of tax receipts that is</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="4.469">coming into the government to even pay</text>
  <text start="730.79" dur="3.599">for the interest and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.069" dur="3.63">going to happen as you add another</text>
  <text start="734.389" dur="4.05">trillion and another trillion guess what</text>
  <text start="736.699" dur="3.271">people aren&amp;#39;t getting jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="738.439" dur="4.44">getting higher paying jobs or getting</text>
  <text start="739.97" dur="5.549">lower paying jobs wages are falling jobs</text>
  <text start="742.879" dur="5.82">are either part-time or low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="745.519" dur="5.01">which means less tax receipts come into</text>
  <text start="748.699" dur="4.2">the government and you know the wealthy</text>
  <text start="750.529" dur="4.761">they know how to get around all the tax</text>
  <text start="752.899" dur="5.4">laws where they pay no taxes whatsoever</text>
  <text start="755.29" dur="5.139">so what is happening here is the</text>
  <text start="758.299" dur="4.35">beginning stages and while it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="760.429" dur="5.31">happening but it&amp;#39;s continuing on now</text>
  <text start="762.649" dur="5.94">where countries are slowly moving away</text>
  <text start="765.739" dur="5.79">from the dollar they want their goal</text>
  <text start="768.589" dur="6.54">back they&amp;#39;re using other currencies to</text>
  <text start="771.529" dur="5.16">make deals to have trade and eventually</text>
  <text start="775.129" dur="4.14">what&amp;#39;s going to happen they will</text>
  <text start="776.689" dur="4.59">eventually move away from the dollar and</text>
  <text start="779.269" dur="3.78">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="781.279" dur="3.81">dollars gonna collapse the country is</text>
  <text start="783.049" dur="3.63">gonna sell the Treasury bonds or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="785.089" dur="3.96">not going to purchase anymore Treasury</text>
  <text start="786.679" dur="3.78">bonds the whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="789.049" dur="2.97">implode and those dollars are gonna</text>
  <text start="790.459" dur="3.3">float right back to the United States</text>
  <text start="792.019" dur="4.081">because nobody needs to hold them in</text>
  <text start="793.759" dur="4.08">reserve and we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="796.1" dur="3.779">it will start out slowly</text>
  <text start="797.839" dur="4.02">yes prices will increase and then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="799.879" dur="3.721">start seeing hyperinflation and then</text>
  <text start="801.859" dur="4.65">what will happen the Fed will try to</text>
  <text start="803.6" dur="7.38">raise rates to counter all of this and</text>
  <text start="806.509" dur="6.6">this is a complete disaster in the</text>
  <text start="810.98" dur="5.219">making because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="813.109" dur="4.35">what happened during 2008 they raised</text>
  <text start="816.199" dur="4.021">the rates raised the rates raised the</text>
  <text start="817.459" dur="3.42">rates and the economy was kind of strong</text>
  <text start="820.22" dur="3.029">back then</text>
  <text start="820.879" dur="3.87">today it&amp;#39;s built on an illusion they</text>
  <text start="823.249" dur="3.99">raised the rates just a little bit don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.749" dur="4.981">even have to raise it anywhere near they</text>
  <text start="827.239" dur="4.111">did what they did in 2008 they just have</text>
  <text start="829.73" dur="3.839">to raise it a little bit and everything</text>
  <text start="831.35" dur="3.63">is going to fall apart and they know</text>
  <text start="833.569" dur="4.11">this this is why they&amp;#39;re taking very</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="4.919">very tiny baby steps because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.679" dur="4.76">want to be responsible for what is going</text>
  <text start="839.899" dur="4.98">to happen when this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="842.439" dur="4.09">completely implode and this is why you</text>
  <text start="844.879" dur="3.36">need to be ready and prepared and I</text>
  <text start="846.529" dur="3.87">think what&amp;#39;s happening is Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.239" dur="4.08">policies are pushing the Fed in a</text>
  <text start="850.399" dur="4.02">certain direction and I think basically</text>
  <text start="852.319" dur="3.06">he wants to gain the narrative to show</text>
  <text start="854.419" dur="3.42">that it was the</text>
  <text start="855.379" dur="5.67">actual banking establishments fault of</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="5.19">why all of this happen and then he can</text>
  <text start="861.049" dur="3.96">start investigation into the central</text>
  <text start="863.029" dur="4.62">bank because we know under the covers</text>
  <text start="865.009" dur="5.31">they have been dealing in some covert</text>
  <text start="867.649" dur="4.92">operations again they&amp;#39;re not working for</text>
  <text start="870.319" dur="5.28">the people of the US or around the world</text>
  <text start="872.569" dur="6.72">and once the covers are you know pull</text>
  <text start="875.599" dur="6.03">back we&amp;#39;re going to see so much in there</text>
  <text start="879.289" dur="4.11">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and I think this</text>
  <text start="881.629" dur="3.36">is why they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing that</text>
  <text start="883.399" dur="3.18">audit bill and eventually that audit</text>
  <text start="884.989" dur="3.54">bill will go through the president will</text>
  <text start="886.579" dur="4.65">sign it and this is when everyone is</text>
  <text start="888.529" dur="6.33">going to see what the central banking</text>
  <text start="891.229" dur="5.91">system actually has been doing all this</text>
  <text start="894.859" dur="3.81">time and what they&amp;#39;ve been doing to the</text>
  <text start="897.139" dur="4.71">country and people are going to be</text>
  <text start="898.669" dur="5.88">shocked and once he rallies the people</text>
  <text start="901.849" dur="4.98">to get rid of the central bank well</text>
  <text start="904.549" dur="3.66">guess what it will be game over for the</text>
  <text start="906.829" dur="3.9">central bank because this will spread</text>
  <text start="908.209" dur="5.25">around the world and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="910.729" dur="5.58">the push that he is moving towards right</text>
  <text start="913.459" dur="4.68">now but again we have to take baby steps</text>
  <text start="916.309" dur="3.541">because intertwining and all this is the</text>
  <text start="918.139" dur="3.54">deep state which uses the central bank</text>
  <text start="919.85" dur="3.839">and first you need to go after the deep</text>
  <text start="921.679" dur="4.14">state you need to basically bring them</text>
  <text start="923.689" dur="4.531">down then go after the central bank and</text>
  <text start="925.819" dur="4.56">then cut everything off and this is what</text>
  <text start="928.22" dur="3.479">is happening right now this is why you</text>
  <text start="930.379" dur="3.2">need to be ready and prepared because</text>
  <text start="931.699" dur="3.35">where you&amp;#39;re headed towards a major</text>
