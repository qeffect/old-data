  <text start="56.629" dur="5.491">Juanita report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="58.43" dur="6.9">is episode 1337 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.12" dur="6.27">July 20th 2017 and part of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.33" dur="6.39">is has the Fed used the same tactic to</text>
  <text start="68.39" dur="5.67">fool the people again let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="4.77">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.06" dur="5.73">over the many years the corporate media</text>
  <text start="76.49" dur="5.37">the central bank&amp;#39;s they keep everyone in</text>
  <text start="79.79" dur="4.49">the dark and what they do is they tell</text>
  <text start="81.86" dur="4.619">you that oh if we give you more debt</text>
  <text start="84.28" dur="3.97">everything&amp;#39;s going to be ok</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="3.871">if we give this country more debt</text>
  <text start="88.25" dur="4.05">everything is fine and the corporate</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="3.78">media backs them up and everyone</text>
  <text start="92.3" dur="4.11">believes that everything is good to go</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="5.129">but we&amp;#39;ve been following Greece for</text>
  <text start="96.41" dur="6.15">instance and we see that no things are</text>
  <text start="99.259" dur="5.131">not well whatsoever and we knew as they</text>
  <text start="102.56" dur="4.32">continually take take on more and more</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="3.96">debt the problem in Greece was going to</text>
  <text start="106.88" dur="4.019">get worse</text>
  <text start="108.35" dur="5.25">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="110.899" dur="5.931">now remember going back to the economic</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="6.719">crisis the Great Recession of 2008</text>
  <text start="116.83" dur="6.94">Greece at that point well since that</text>
  <text start="120.319" dur="6.631">time it is never recovered actually the</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="8.73">home prices in Greece between 2009 and</text>
  <text start="126.95" dur="8.28">2014 they declined by 34 percent and now</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="4.95">the Bank of Greece released some</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="5.64">official data showing that the first</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="5.91">quarter of 2017 apartment prices run on</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="6.18">average down by 1.8%</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="7.59">now when we look at home prices we can</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="7.38">see that home prices have also dropped</text>
  <text start="150.95" dur="7.53">and right now they&amp;#39;ve lost a third of</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="6.809">their value in five years so the</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="4.589">situation in Greece is not going well</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.691">whatsoever now in other places in Europe</text>
  <text start="163.069" dur="4.621">we can see the bubbles the housing</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="5.22">bubbles have been propped up and we can</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.829">see that in certain areas yes the prices</text>
  <text start="170.15" dur="4.68">of homes are rising but what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="4.951">happen is that bubbles are going to pop</text>
  <text start="174.83" dur="4.26">all over the place and we can see out in</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="3.15">Canada they have a huge housing bubble</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="3.81">we see in Australia we see in the United</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="4.5">States we see in the UK and a lot of</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="4.25">these areas the housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="5.94">already starting to</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="6.55">deflate and we&amp;#39;re already seeing sign to</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="5.22">this and it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse as</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="5.73">we move forward now we talked a lot</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.939">about minimum wage and how all these</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="4.259">states were voting to get more pay for</text>
  <text start="202.219" dur="4.47">their workers which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="203.689" dur="5.151">fantastic the problem is we need to go</text>
  <text start="206.689" dur="5.97">to the root of the problem because as</text>
  <text start="208.84" dur="7">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past this is not a fix</text>
  <text start="212.659" dur="4.92">this is a band-aid fix because what</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="3.179">happens when corporations say oh wait I</text>
  <text start="217.579" dur="4.201">have to pay this worker a lot more money</text>
  <text start="219.019" dur="6.571">well what they then do is they turn</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="5.549">towards technology and they get rid of</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="3.81">those people and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="4.37">that McDonald&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re starting to see in</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="8.179">Walmart right now Walmart is replacing</text>
  <text start="231.699" dur="9.22">4,000 employees with machines machines</text>
  <text start="237.579" dur="6.011">that will count cash now there used to</text>
  <text start="240.919" dur="5.1">be individuals that kept the books they</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="6">counted the cash and now they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="246.019" dur="5.521">replaced and this is not just happening</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="5.31">in the back office it&amp;#39;s also happening</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="5.49">on the front where we see that cashiers</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="3.049">they&amp;#39;re being replaced by you</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="4.44">do-it-yourself</text>
  <text start="257.949" dur="5.53">self checkout and if we look at</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="3.9">McDonald&amp;#39;s and many other places all</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="6">these minimum-wage workers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="6.75">completely disappearing now the problem</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="4.62">is is that the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="5.22">continually decreases and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.099" dur="5.611">decreasing over time this is because of</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="4.109">the central bank this is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="4.139">loaning the money to the government and</text>
  <text start="281.449" dur="4.47">the government is out of control they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.849" dur="3.81">just spending like crazy so they have to</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="4.68">loan more money to pay for the interest</text>
  <text start="287.659" dur="5.391">which means they need more taxes from</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="4.891">the people to make up the difference and</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="6.28">they need to pay back the Federal</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="6.989">Reserve and this situation it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="5.639">going to disappear it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="302.479" dur="6.481">worse as time goes on as we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="304.969" dur="6.42">since 1913 especially after 1971 when we</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="4.59">came off the gold standard and what</text>
  <text start="311.389" dur="5.161">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete and</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="7.23">utter breakdown of the system wages are</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="6.06">declining there are no jobs retail there</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="5.43">laying off left and right the food</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="5.34">industry is starting to falter and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="3.54">starting to see that everything is</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="3.89">starting to come to an end now remember</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="4.889">in the beginning of the system back in</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="5.71">1971 when we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="5.551">the partial gold standard all of a</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="4.71">sudden we had high interest rates they</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="6.36">were creating currency like crazy and</text>
  <text start="342.26" dur="6.27">everything inflated wages inflated house</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="3.11">prices inflated and everyone thought</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="4.38">this was great</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="6.1">40 plus years later we&amp;#39;re at the back</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="4.35">end of a system that is dying that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="3.6">we see the opposite happening right now</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="4.23">this is why we see wages declining this</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="5.46">is why we see manufacturing poof gone</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="5.34">out of the country too expensive this is</text>
  <text start="364.82" dur="7.92">why we see minimum wage all the way up</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="8.43">to $15 this is why we see people trying</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="5.04">to find jobs that just don&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="375.26" dur="4.89">anymore this is why we see the retail</text>
  <text start="377.78" dur="5.43">sector collapsing the food industry</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="4.92">collapsing the housing market collapsing</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.32">and that&amp;#39;s going to lead into many more</text>
  <text start="385.07" dur="5.9">things I mean we&amp;#39;re already seeing the</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="7.01">rental growth in the u.s. it is</text>
  <text start="390.97" dur="7.6">decelerating right now which means</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="6.28">people can&amp;#39;t afford rents just like use</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="4.409">car prices they&amp;#39;re also coming down</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="4.52">right now and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="402.979" dur="4.291">major problem how single-family rents as</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="5.32">measured by CoreLogic</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="6.6">they are reporting that rents right now</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="6.24">are seeing a decline during the last 18</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="8.33">months now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="10.139">this is if we go back to 2006 going into</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="8.11">2007 we hit the peak of rental growth</text>
  <text start="427.039" dur="6.051">and then it started to come down here we</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="6.78">reach the peak of rental growth around</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="6.94">the middle of 2016 and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="6.36">come down we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="5.07">patterns once again now again this is on</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="3.18">average there are going to be places</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="3.39">that are still strong and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="3.87">to be places that are very weak but on</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="3.179">average we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="2.909">signs and eventually what happens to</text>
  <text start="451.669" dur="3.081">those places that are seeing strong</text>
  <text start="453.409" dur="3.081">rental where rental price</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="3.27">are up they&amp;#39;re going to start coming</text>
  <text start="456.49" dur="4.14">down because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ve seen it during 2008 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="4.29">seeing the same exact signs once again</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="4.05">we are now seeing all the soft data</text>
  <text start="464.92" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s coming in well it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="3.99">line up with the hard data and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="3.06">been looking at the hard data and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="4.2">seeing that hard data is continually</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="4.5">declining now the Philly Fed numbers</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="4.68">came in they&amp;#39;re soft data points and</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re completely one gigantic</text>
  <text start="479.95" dur="4.14">disappointment and we can see that</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re following the same part pattern</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="5.67">as the hard data and we see that the</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="4.65">Philly Fed survey well it completely</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="3.81">missed expectations it dropped to</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="3.99">nineteen point five and this is the</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="4.47">lowest since November of 2016 new orders</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="5.01">collapsed employees tumbled average</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="6.18">workweek slumped so we can see that</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="5.91">things are well headed south at this</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="4.89">point now it&amp;#39;s very interesting is the</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="4.92">corporate media they&amp;#39;re running almost</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="5.07">the same articles that we saw prior to</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="5.959">the housing collapse and I saw out of</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="6.359">Yahoo Finance Yahoo the headline reads</text>
  <text start="517.409" dur="7.151">too many Americans are buying homes they</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="6.141">can&amp;#39;t afford now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="6.779">individuals that have purchased homes</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="7.24">well they have used no money down they</text>
  <text start="531.339" dur="5.221">have very low interest rates or maybe</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="4.71">variable interest rates and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="4.86">the same exact patterns that we as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.65">seen prior to 2008 a lot of these homes</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="3.9">are not even purchased by Americans but</text>
  <text start="543.28" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s very interesting that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="4.86">showing that people have purchased homes</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="5.19">around 40 million Americans where they</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="5.67">purchase these homes and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="6.75">really afford them and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="5.67">what happened bet prior to 2008 this is</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="4.53">this research is coming out of Harvard</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="5.01">University so we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="563.89" dur="6.24">exact signs that we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="566.53" dur="6">housing industry and what is happening</text>
  <text start="570.13" dur="4.59">here as we&amp;#39;ve seen before people have</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="4.77">purchased the houses at the height of</text>
  <text start="574.72" dur="4.35">the market now the markets starting to</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="4.14">come down now of course people want to</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="3.96">refinance people are saying oh wait this</text>
  <text start="581.44" dur="4.05">house is very expensive I have a</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="4.71">variable mortgage and now you know rates</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="3.08">are going up a little bit and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="2.6">afford this</text>
  <text start="588.57" dur="3.21">well we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact signs</text>
  <text start="590.34" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re starting to run the articles</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="6.45">which tells us that strange things are</text>
  <text start="594.78" dur="6.09">ahead of us we see the ECB right now is</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="4.8">going to keep rates qyz going to be</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="5.31">unchanged but they said something very</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="8.69">interesting and it&amp;#39;s the same thing the</text>
  <text start="606.18" dur="9.33">Fed has said they will increase QE if</text>
  <text start="611.72" dur="6.03">the economic outlook worsens or the</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="4.77">financial conditions become inconsistent</text>
  <text start="617.75" dur="4.3">with further progress towards a</text>
  <text start="620.28" dur="5.52">sustained adjustment in the path of</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="5.34">inflation and basically they&amp;#39;re covering</text>
  <text start="625.8" dur="3.6">themselves because they know this</text>
  <text start="627.39" dur="4.23">economy is completely fake they know</text>
  <text start="629.4" dur="4.73">it&amp;#39;s built on an illusion they know the</text>
  <text start="631.62" dur="5.94">economy is going to turn downward and</text>
  <text start="634.13" dur="6.1">the Fed and the ECB they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="5.46">making preparations to say listen if the</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="5.49">economy collapses we will step in once</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="4.74">again and save it because we will pump</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="5.1">stimulus in like we&amp;#39;ve knit like you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="647.76" dur="6.45">never seen before and they are prepared</text>
  <text start="650.82" dur="6.24">and ready to do this and we know that</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="6.03">they need to do this to keep their</text>
  <text start="657.06" dur="5.19">illusion alive but during this downturn</text>
  <text start="660.24" dur="3.8">things are going to be completely</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="4.8">different now</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="4.81">Brandon Smith is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="4.14">looking at what the Fed has said</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="3.65">especially Janet Yellen where she said</text>
  <text start="671.19" dur="4.35">that we&amp;#39;re not going to see any type of</text>
  <text start="672.5" dur="4.93">financial crisis in our lifetime and he</text>
