  <text start="77.59" dur="5.55">shut down the globalist system now the</text>
  <text start="80.29" dur="5.13">global system was to have these trade</text>
  <text start="83.14" dur="4.53">deals that would work with the central</text>
  <text start="85.42" dur="6.809">banking system with the global system</text>
  <text start="87.67" dur="8.64">and at this time we can see that those</text>
  <text start="92.229" dur="8.121">trade deals well they are being shut</text>
  <text start="96.31" dur="7.559">down now TPP we know was completely</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="6.67">rejected it didn&amp;#39;t go forward if Clinton</text>
  <text start="103.869" dur="6.181">was elected most likely TPP would be in</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="5.28">place right now we see that NAFTA well</text>
  <text start="110.05" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s being negotiated and we know that</text>
  <text start="112.3" dur="5.55">Trump wants NAFTA completely gone and</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s making all these threats right now</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="3.57">because it&amp;#39;s been going on for a very</text>
  <text start="119.2" dur="5.339">long time and it looks like they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="5.009">come to any type of a deal so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.539" dur="3.69">saying you know what let&amp;#39;s just get rid</text>
  <text start="126.429" dur="3.421">of NAFTA altogether that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="128.229" dur="4.381">he wanted from the beginning he just</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="5.49">wanted to get rid of NAFTA and basically</text>

  <text start="135.34" dur="5.729">of the globalist system each phase where</text>
  <text start="138.79" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s getting rid of these trade deals</text>
  <text start="141.069" dur="7.171">and every other deal he is setting the</text>
  <text start="144.55" dur="6.18">economy up to be transitioned into the</text>
  <text start="148.24" dur="4.5">new system this is what we see happening</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="4.47">right now on the other hand the central</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="4.53">bank they&amp;#39;re trying to hold on to their</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="4.56">system now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="157.27" dur="4.079">that New York Fed they launched a LIBOR</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="3.71">replacement now we know LIBOR is</text>
  <text start="161.349" dur="7.681">manipulated and they replaced it with</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="8.34">Sofer sof r and once again this secured</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="6">overnight financing rate is another</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="5.259">manipulated interest rate benchmark and</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not manipulated but</text>
  <text start="177.069" dur="3.781">we know it&amp;#39;s going to be rigged and</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="5.191">manipulated because this is how the</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="5.43">central bank&amp;#39;s work now of course</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re saying this because LIBOR as</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="5.19">they know is completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="7.139">they set the new secured overnight</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="7.41">financing rate at 1.8% much lower than</text>
  <text start="195.819" dur="6.061">the LIBOR rate so here we are with the</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="5.31">Fed once again playing their games to</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="3.84">convince everyone that look look what</text>

  <text start="205.72" dur="3.09">manipulation this is not what is</text>
  <text start="207.489" dur="3.961">happening right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.41">save their system they&amp;#39;re trying to save</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="4.44">it in a way where they can bring down</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="4.8">this system blame it on Trump blame it</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="3.599">on those Patriots who are trying to</text>
  <text start="218.02" dur="4.2">bring down the system to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="4.711">central bank and both sides are trying</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="3.9">to gain the narrative this is the battle</text>
  <text start="224.2" dur="5.7">that is going on right now in the</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="6.51">meantime out in Russia we have Iran now</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="5.309">they are getting ready to sign the</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="4.98">russian-led Eurasian Economic Union and</text>

  <text start="246.09" dur="5.98">Kazakhstan they&amp;#39;re all part of the same</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="5.97">block and basically this is going to be</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="5.849">a free trade zone where these countries</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="5.22">can trade freely and just like we have</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="5.571">the one belt one Road all these trading</text>

  <text start="279.4" dur="4.47">central bankers are going to fight in</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="4.831">any way they possibly can to keep their</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="3.93">system now the one thing we need to</text>
  <text start="286" dur="3.15">understand about a central banking</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.41">system again I&amp;#39;ve said this many times</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="7.23">before we don&amp;#39;t need a central banking</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="7.17">system it does not add anything to the</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="4.62">world to the people it only adds to</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="3.84">those people who are running it and</text>

  <text start="492.11" dur="4.349">became over issue they became surprised</text>
  <text start="493.939" dur="4.44">deep and everything had to be devalued</text>

  <text start="517.49" dur="4.529">of such a success story then of course</text>
  <text start="520.009" dur="5.551">we had the Federal Reserve which was</text>
  <text start="522.019" dur="6.541">introduced in 1913 and since that time</text>

  <text start="528.56" dur="5.219">go the opposite way in 1933 President</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="4.019">Roosevelt made ownership of gold illegal</text>

  <text start="612.649" dur="6.151">know it Trump in government knows it and</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="6.57">this is why there&amp;#39;s a race to bring down</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="6.84">the entire system now the central</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="5.91">bankers they like to control each crash</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="4.199">why because they can control the</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="3.419">narrative they can point fingers they</text>
  <text start="629.839" dur="4.891">can blame everyone else but themselves</text>
  <text start="631.399" dur="4.771">this is how they work especially when we</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="4.38">move to the point where there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="636.17" dur="5.01">be a reset once there&amp;#39;s once we reach</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="4.14">that point where the whole system is</text>
  <text start="641.18" dur="4.409">completely breaking down right in front</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="4.08">of our eyes they know it&amp;#39;s time for a</text>
  <text start="645.589" dur="4.731">reset and what they do is they start to</text>
  <text start="647.33" dur="5.61">create the economic infrastructure</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="4.81">someplace else they do it very slowly</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="5.55">over a period of time they move</text>
  <text start="655.13" dur="6.12">manufacturing they move gold they move</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="6.539">the exchanges they continually do this</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="7.62">over time to a less developed nation and</text>
  <text start="665.029" dur="5.821">they build it up and when it&amp;#39;s time what</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="4.98">they do is they move it over and they</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="6.45">make the world think that oh no this is</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="6.09">natural because after an event a war or</text>
  <text start="677.3" dur="5.67">something like that we need to restart</text>
  <text start="679.94" dur="5.01">the system we can&amp;#39;t do it in this old</text>

  <text start="684.95" dur="4.11">they have no manufacturing they have</text>
  <text start="687.44" dur="4.35">nothing there there&amp;#39;s no gold there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.06" dur="5.31">nothing the country needs to rebuild but</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="4.65">this new country we have everything</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="5.339">already set up we already have the gold</text>
  <text start="696.44" dur="5.04">we have everything and this is what the</text>
  <text start="699.709" dur="4.021">central bankers were eventually going to</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="5.52">do now it wasn&amp;#39;t it it would not start</text>
  <text start="703.73" dur="6.06">out as a central banking system but what</text>
  <text start="707" dur="5.22">they would do is they would manage it it</text>
  <text start="709.79" dur="5.19">would be back by gold or there be gold</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="5.91">to build confidence and over time as</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past they slowly come</text>
  <text start="718.13" dur="6.96">off of that system and they basically in</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="5.91">gage into their system which is the</text>
  <text start="725.09" dur="5.82">creation of currency which basically</text>
  <text start="727.82" dur="5.49">goes haywire and yes they can keep the</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="3.78">system going for you know 40 years or so</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="3.45">before the whole thing starts to break</text>
  <text start="734.69" dur="4.98">down once again and this is what they</text>
  <text start="736.76" dur="5.22">wanted to do with this system that is</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="6.21">crashing right now and it would have</text>
  <text start="741.98" dur="7.2">gone this route if Trump wasn&amp;#39;t elected</text>
  <text start="745.88" dur="6.45">since he was elected things have changed</text>
  <text start="749.18" dur="5.72">the transition has changed and what</text>
  <text start="752.33" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Trump is</text>
  <text start="754.9" dur="5.68">dismantling everything the globalists</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="4.8">the central banks have set up remember</text>
  <text start="760.58" dur="6.06">the central bank&amp;#39;s their push was to</text>
  <text start="763.13" dur="6.66">have a one-world currency the globalist</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="5.67">of one world currency a system which</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="5.61">would be controlled by a central</text>
  <text start="772.31" dur="5.46">location that&amp;#39;s their whole model this</text>
  <text start="775.4" dur="4.74">is why they wanted all the countries on</text>
  <text start="777.77" dur="5.43">an even playing field everything has</text>
  <text start="780.14" dur="5.7">changed now and Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="783.2" dur="6.03">are going to be battling against the</text>
  <text start="785.84" dur="5.88">central banking system and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="4.8">be a long drawn-out battle because</text>
  <text start="791.72" dur="4.26">central bankers just don&amp;#39;t go away they</text>
  <text start="794.03" dur="3.87">want to keep their control they have no</text>
  <text start="795.98" dur="3.45">allegiance to a country a group of</text>
  <text start="797.9" dur="3.51">people they don&amp;#39;t care about the people</text>
  <text start="799.43" dur="4.2">they don&amp;#39;t care if half the population</text>
  <text start="801.41" dur="4.26">is obliterated it may it makes no</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="5.01">difference to them because they know as</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="4.59">long as they maintain control they have</text>
  <text start="808.64" dur="4.11">the power as long as they can create the</text>
  <text start="810.26" dur="5.13">currency for all these countries they</text>
  <text start="812.75" dur="4.2">have the power and they can corrupt each</text>
  <text start="815.39" dur="3.87">and every government they&amp;#39;re not worried</text>
  <text start="816.95" dur="4.44">about that and right now just like with</text>
  <text start="819.26" dur="5.7">Andrew Jackson we&amp;#39;re heading down that</text>
  <text start="821.39" dur="6.24">same exact path so no matter what this</text>
  <text start="824.96" dur="5.43">fight currency is completely doomed the</text>
  <text start="827.63" dur="8.07">reset is coming and you can see by Trump</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="8.43">pushing NAFTA out pushing TPP out and</text>
  <text start="835.7" dur="5.55">taking control and setting up these</text>
  <text start="838.82" dur="5.1">tariffs reciprocal taxes you can see</text>
  <text start="841.25" dur="5.19">that he is looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="843.92" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re running out of time the system is</text>
  <text start="846.44" dur="5.07">going to implode on its own and he wants</text>
  <text start="849.68" dur="3.96">everything in place this is why the</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="4.23">central bankers they&amp;#39;re pushing interest</text>
  <text start="853.64" dur="4.47">rates up they&amp;#39;re both doing</text>
  <text start="855.74" dur="5.46">same exact thing it all depends on who</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="5.85">controls the narrative and who has the</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="4.14">ability to say this is why this happened</text>
  <text start="863.96" dur="3.48">now of course the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="865.34" dur="4.2">intertwined with the deep state where</text>
  <text start="867.44" dur="4.74">they have the corporate media as the</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="4.41">mouthpiece so you know when the system</text>
  <text start="872.18" dur="4.08">goes down and were into this recession</text>
  <text start="873.95" dur="4.92">entering that depression the corporate</text>
  <text start="876.26" dur="5.31">media they&amp;#39;re gonna be out there pushing</text>
  <text start="878.87" dur="3.21">their agenda saying this was all Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.57" dur="2.34">fault</text>
  <text start="882.08" dur="3.75">the central bank tried to control it</text>
  <text start="883.91" dur="3.75">with interest rates and Trump put forth</text>
  <text start="885.83" dur="3.45">his terrorists reciprocal taxes on the</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="3.54">other hand Trump will call out the</text>
  <text start="889.28" dur="4.5">corporate media and the central bank</text>
  <text start="891.2" dur="4.41">probably calling for an audit saying</text>
  <text start="893.78" dur="4.83">that they&amp;#39;re the ones who destroyed the</text>
  <text start="895.61" dur="5.73">economy and he&amp;#39;ll start giving proof and</text>
  <text start="898.61" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;ll make a case of why the central</text>
  <text start="901.34" dur="4.83">bank needs to be audited and we can see</text>
  <text start="903.62" dur="5.37">already that there are bills in place to</text>
  <text start="906.17" dur="3.96">make the dollar linked to gold and this</text>
  <text start="908.99" dur="3.39">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that these bills are going</text>
  <text start="910.13" dur="4.68">to be voted in but this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="912.38" dur="5.01">stages I don&amp;#39;t think the government</text>
  <text start="914.81" dur="4.14">officials that we have now in Congress</text>
  <text start="917.39" dur="3.66">will say hey yeah that&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="918.95" dur="3">let&amp;#39;s do that let&amp;#39;s put some checks and</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="2.7">balances on there</text>
  <text start="921.95" dur="4.29">so we can&amp;#39;t get the free money from the</text>
  <text start="923.75" dur="4.41">central bank no most of the individuals</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="3.99">in government they&amp;#39;re gonna have to be</text>
  <text start="928.16" dur="5.01">fired and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to bring on</text>
  <text start="930.23" dur="4.68">new people who look at the situation and</text>
  <text start="933.17" dur="4.02">say yeah this is a good idea</text>
  <text start="934.91" dur="4.14">we need checks and balances we need to</text>
  <text start="937.19" dur="3.99">make sure that the central bank does not</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="5.97">exist and this is how we can move</text>
  <text start="941.18" dur="6.99">forward but one thing is for sure we are</text>
  <text start="945.02" dur="4.77">headed towards a transition so get</text>
