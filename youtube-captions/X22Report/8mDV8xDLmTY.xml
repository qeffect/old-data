  <text start="58.42" dur="5.88">episode 1613 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="61.87" dur="5.16">11th 2018 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.3" dur="5.73">is the central bank&amp;#39;s agenda to bring</text>
  <text start="67.03" dur="5.13">down the economy has been exposed let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.03" dur="4.29">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.16" dur="4.89">news now we understand that the real</text>
  <text start="74.32" dur="5.85">estate bubble it is popping in Canada</text>
  <text start="77.05" dur="5.67">Australia Europe even here in the United</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="5.43">States we see a lot of things breaking</text>
  <text start="82.72" dur="6.18">down and we understand that China has</text>
  <text start="85.6" dur="5.94">already told their investors to pull</text>
  <text start="88.9" dur="5.13">their investments out of the US and put</text>
  <text start="91.54" dur="6.21">it into the belt and road system this is</text>
  <text start="94.03" dur="6.06">their new trade platform and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.75" dur="6.39">seeing is that this is actually having</text>
  <text start="100.09" dur="7.529">an effect on real estate now in the</text>
  <text start="104.14" dur="7.32">second quarter sales of large office</text>
  <text start="107.619" dur="7.081">properties in Manhattan fell 26 percent</text>
  <text start="111.46" dur="6.69">from the same period a year ago it was</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="7.23">the worst second quarter dollar volume</text>
  <text start="118.15" dur="5.55">in years and if we look at the graph we</text>
  <text start="121.93" dur="4.77">can see that in the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="123.7" dur="6.27">2016 sales hit about eight point nine</text>
  <text start="126.7" dur="8.7">billion in the second quarter of 2018</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="8.67">sales hit about 2.9 billion and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="9.39">see why this is happening now we need to</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="9.12">remember back in time when Chinese</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="5.55">investors were coming in and making</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="6.36">these investments they were buying these</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="7.679">huge buildings huge transactions there</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="7.17">was a 2.2 billion sale of a 245 Park</text>
  <text start="158.019" dur="4.951">Avenue to the HN a group that was the</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="2.13">sixth largest transaction in Manhattan</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="3.989">ever</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="5.879">the hna paid one thousand two hundred</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="4.801">eighty-two per square foot for the tower</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="6.241">which was called among the highest price</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="6.39">per pound for this type of asset it was</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="6.15">the last big Chinese property purchase</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="6.3">in Manhattan this year the first quarter</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.89">was propped up by a 2.4 billion sale of</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="5.4">Chelsea market to goo</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="5.45">the deal accounted for over half the</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="7.32">total transaction volume in the quarter</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="7.87">the price was a blistering 2181 per</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="4.17">square foot but what brought the sales</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.49">volume down in the second quarter was</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="6.75">the absence of high-profile</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="5.02">billion-dollar office deals China wanted</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="3.54">their investors to redirect their</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="3.93">investing to the Belton Road and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.63" dur="5.75">exactly what they did and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="6.74">seeing the same high-priced purchases</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="7.17">now without these foreign investors</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="7.39">without Google purchasing these</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="5.02">multi-billion dollar properties what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="4.23">going to happen well things are going to</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="4.35">start to deteriorate very very quickly</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="5.94">and we&amp;#39;re already seeing this happening</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="5.31">and on top of that we know that a lot of</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="3.629">these prices have been pushed up quite a</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="6.24">bit we&amp;#39;re gonna see all that start to</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="11.601">come down now global debt has hit a</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="10.889">record high of 247 trillion and the IIF</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="7.33">issues a warning with this huge amount</text>
  <text start="256.359" dur="6.361">of debt every quarter the Institute of</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="4.2">International Finance publishes a new</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.41">number of total amount of global debt</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="4.95">outstanding and every quarter the result</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="4.83">is the same a new record high but of</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="5.4">course today when they reported that</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="5.31">information there was no exception</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="4.89">according to the IAF&amp;#39;s latest global</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="4.649">debt monitor the amount of debt held in</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="4.23">the world rose by the biggest amount in</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="5.581">two years during the first quarter of</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="5.25">2018 when it grew by 8 trillion to hit a</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="5.64">new all-time high of about two hundred</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="7.5">and forty-seven trillion up from 238</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="7.49">trillion as of December 31st 2017 and up</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="8.24">from 30 trillion from the end of 2016 in</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="7.78">other words there is now a quarter</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="7.8">quadrillion dollars in global debt and</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="7.56">it represents 318 percent of global GDP</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="6.249">more concerning is that this was the</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="4.27">first time since the third quarter of</text>
  <text start="318.909" dur="4.6">2016 that</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="5.25">global debt the GDP increased suggesting</text>
  <text start="323.509" dur="5.371">that the marginal utility of debt is</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="5.7">once again below one this is how the</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="4.409">debt is broken down as of the first</text>
  <text start="331.19" dur="5.25">quarter of 2018 and compared to the</text>
  <text start="333.289" dur="6.871">first quarter of 2013 non-financial</text>
  <text start="336.44" dur="6.509">corporate debt well five years ago it</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="7.89">was standing at 58 trillion today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.949" dur="7.44">74 trillion government debt well five</text>
  <text start="348.05" dur="6.839">years ago was 56 trillion today it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="7.881">67 trillion financial debt five years</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="6.84">ago was 56 trillion now it&amp;#39;s 61 trillion</text>
  <text start="358.27" dur="8.47">household debt five years ago was 40</text>
  <text start="361.729" dur="7.53">trillion now it&amp;#39;s 47 trillion so we see</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="6.06">that we&amp;#39;re in a bit of a problem here</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="5.88">with the debt load now the government</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="5.67">did that GDP ratio has surged to a</text>
  <text start="375.139" dur="6.991">hundred and one percent in the US what</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="6.509">was surprising about this report is not</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="5.969">that you know we hit these huge high</text>
  <text start="384.979" dur="5.94">debt numbers those are now standard we</text>
  <text start="388.099" dur="5.611">we just come to expect that is that the</text>
  <text start="390.919" dur="5.191">IIF voiced a strongly negative opinion</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="6.65">of recent developments in the debt arena</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="7.29">now the iaf managing director hung Tran</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="6.64">said the pace is indeed a cause for</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="6.75">concern the problem with the pace and</text>
  <text start="407" dur="6.539">speed is if you borrow or if you lend</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="6.169">very quickly the quality of credit tends</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="5.071">to suffer it also means more governments</text>
  <text start="416.319" dur="4.931">businesses and individuals have been</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="5.13">borrowing that could have trouble paying</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="6.84">the money back or merely paying interest</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.739">on it as rates rise the quality of</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="5.669">credit worthiness has declined sharply</text>
  <text start="430.479" dur="6.791">transit and Moody&amp;#39;s has said the same</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="6.72">thing at the end of May and the IIF they</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="5.91">didn&amp;#39;t stop there they cautioned that</text>
  <text start="440.479" dur="5.521">with global growth losing steam and</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="4.95">becoming increasingly divergent and with</text>
  <text start="446" dur="3.9">the u.s. rates rising worries about</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="4.05">credit risk are starting to creep back</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="4.14">to the forefront including a many</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="4.73">developed economies such as the United</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="5.91">eh Western Europe government debt is</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="7.51">higher than it was prior to the crisis</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="5.66">and corporate debt is higher as well now</text>
  <text start="464.42" dur="5.33">think about this</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="7.6">the pace of debt a household debt</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="7.42">corporate debt government debt all this</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="6.78">debt is rising very very quickly wages</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="6.87">well they&amp;#39;re not moving up so if wages</text>
  <text start="479.99" dur="6.72">aren&amp;#39;t moving up well people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.04" dur="4.71">being taxed as much right the tax</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="5.73">receipts headed into the government to</text>
  <text start="488.75" dur="5.58">pay this debt not there if wages aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.98">rising it&amp;#39;s very difficult to pay</text>
  <text start="494.33" dur="5.4">household debt and if we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="4.02">inflation on top of this the whole</text>
  <text start="499.73" dur="4.65">situation just gets much much worse</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="5.9">remember the central banking system this</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="5.7">system is not designed to last this long</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="5.41">the central bankers they know they have</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="5.61">a certain period of time the debt load</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="4.38">what they&amp;#39;ve done to the economy it all</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="3.75">deteriorates remember they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="5.16">everything for themselves making</text>
  <text start="519.44" dur="4.08">themselves very very wealthy and what</text>
  <text start="522.29" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;ve been doing they&amp;#39;ve been picking</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="3.93">up hard assets they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="525.71" dur="3.78">paper money yes they have the paper</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="3.6">money but they really care about the</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="3.84">hard assets because when everything</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="5.43">falls apart the paper money goes to zero</text>
  <text start="533.33" dur="5.04">they have the hard assets because they</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="4.29">know they can always push the button and</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="6.15">create more of this worthless paper</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="5.76">money so what is the central bank doing</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="5.82">right now well we talked about how they</text>
  <text start="546.53" dur="7.05">decided to discontinue their Fred graph</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="4.74">of their balance sheet normalization we</text>
  <text start="553.58" dur="3.51">also understand that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="555.08" dur="4.77">is out there and they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="557.09" dur="5.28">that we&amp;#39;re headed towards a recession we</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="4.14">also know that the Fed realizes that</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="3.81">they can&amp;#39;t keep the system going much</text>
  <text start="563.99" dur="3.45">longer so what they do is they hide a</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="3.54">lot of their data remember when they</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="4.05">start a quantitative easing what did</text>
  <text start="569.72" dur="4.17">they do they got rid of the m3 money</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="6.06">supply this way you can&amp;#39;t see what was</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="5.97">going on and what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="5.01">now is they&amp;#39;re hiding some of their data</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="5.28">or changing it this is what they like to</text>
  <text start="582.56" dur="4.98">do they like to change it so it looks</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="4.86">like they didn&amp;#39;t cause the problem</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="4.65">we had no indication that a recession</text>
  <text start="590" dur="4.23">was coming and they also hid other data</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="4.53">and this is going back a little while</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="4.98">and we talked about this this was the</text>
  <text start="596.72" dur="4.86">change in labor market condition index</text>
  <text start="599.21" dur="5.31">and this was actually a pretty darn good</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="5.52">indicator because it predicted</text>
  <text start="604.52" dur="5.61">recessions almost every single time but</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="4.59">they decided to discontinue this also so</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="3.24">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that we</text>
  <text start="611.69" dur="3.66">talked about the yield curve just the</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="3.78">other day when the Fed was out there</text>
  <text start="615.35" dur="4.41">saying that the yield curve right now</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s not really a great indicator to</text>
  <text start="619.76" dur="3.75">tell us that we&amp;#39;re heading into a</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="4.32">recession really can&amp;#39;t be used today</text>
  <text start="623.51" dur="4.38">because it really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="625.31" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s you know distorted and they were</text>
  <text start="627.89" dur="5.01">using a lot of excuses and it reminds me</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="4.74">of the 1970s when they said gold</text>
  <text start="632.9" dur="3.45">speculators were in the market and this</text>
  <text start="635.09" dur="4.44">is why we need to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="5.01">standard so what the Fed did was they</text>
  <text start="639.53" dur="4.02">made this story up that the old curve is</text>
  <text start="641.36" dur="5.19">no longer good we can&amp;#39;t use it nobody</text>
  <text start="643.55" dur="5.94">look at it everyone look away the Fed</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="5.76">decided to create a new yield curve and</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="6.96">this new yield curve does a much better</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="7.95">job at predicting and showing us what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.45" dur="6.36">really going on in the economy so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.26" dur="4.47">look at this for a second here what if</text>
  <text start="662.81" dur="4.14">your local weatherman forecasted weather</text>
  <text start="664.73" dur="4.86">not based on atmospheric conditions and</text>
  <text start="666.95" dur="5.43">other scientific data but instead on his</text>
  <text start="669.59" dur="4.77">own forecasts I dream it will rain in</text>
  <text start="672.38" dur="4.86">three days therefore my forecast is for</text>
  <text start="674.36" dur="5.04">rain in three days his prediction method</text>
  <text start="677.24" dur="4.74">if uncovered would probably lead him to</text>
  <text start="679.4" dur="4.44">seek a new career the weatherman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.98" dur="3.78">forecast is a good way to describe the</text>
  <text start="683.84" dur="6">new yield curve the Fed has recently</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="6.06">publicized this curve is calculated by</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="4.74">comparing the current three-month rate</text>
  <text start="691.82" dur="6.03">for Treasuries versus what the rate is</text>
  <text start="694.58" dur="6.53">expected to be six quarters from now and</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="6.42">this is what the Fed expects it to be</text>
  <text start="701.11" dur="6.46">the forward rate is calculated using the</text>
  <text start="704.27" dur="7.4">current rate and the interpolated rate</text>
  <text start="707.57" dur="6.56">on 1.5 and 1.7 year Treasury notes in</text>
  <text start="711.67" dur="5.38">layman&amp;#39;s term the curve is simply a</text>
  <text start="714.13" dur="6.8">forecast of what the market thinks the</text>
  <text start="717.05" dur="6.76">Fed will do now this is crazy why</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="5.36">they do this well let&amp;#39;s look at this a</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="6.45">little bit closer the traditional</text>
  <text start="726.29" dur="6.1">two-year 10-year curve spread is falling</text>
  <text start="730.26" dur="4.019">at a decent pace and has been in a</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="6.87">decline for the better part of the last</text>
  <text start="734.279" dur="5.971">five years the new curve right now well</text>
  <text start="739.26" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s doing something completely</text>
  <text start="740.25" dur="4.77">different now remember the old curve is</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="6.39">showing that we&amp;#39;re declining the new</text>
  <text start="745.02" dur="4.95">curve has been in a slight uptrend over</text>
  <text start="748.95" dur="4.11">the same period</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="6.75">clearly the curves now are sending</text>
  <text start="753.06" dur="6.92">different messages the Fed has much more</text>
  <text start="756.72" dur="8.369">control over the shape of the new curve</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="9.01">versus the traditional curve the Fed has</text>
  <text start="765.089" dur="5.601">the ability to make this curve go any</text>
  <text start="768.99" dur="4.95">way it wants</text>
  <text start="770.69" dur="5.5">they have full control over it think</text>
  <text start="773.94" dur="6.48">about what&amp;#39;s happening here they are</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="8.33">removing data hiding it they are</text>
  <text start="780.42" dur="9.96">changing how they calculate things and</text>
  <text start="784.52" dur="8.71">the question is why now remember the</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="5.579">yield curve is showing us that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="793.23" dur="5.85">heading towards a recession every time</text>
  <text start="795.959" dur="5.911">we see the yield curve invert it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="799.08" dur="4.47">great indicator letting us know that</text>
  <text start="801.87" dur="5.159">we&amp;#39;re heading towards something really</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="5.4">really bad same thing with their other</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="5.43">indicators which have predicted</text>
  <text start="808.95" dur="7.17">recessions in the past and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="812.459" dur="6.891">predicting a recession why change the</text>
  <text start="816.12" dur="6.3">yield curve now why make the case that</text>
  <text start="819.35" dur="5.979">it doesn&amp;#39;t work in this new market well</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="5.58">it does work in this new market in this</text>
  <text start="825.329" dur="5.101">new economy that they created they just</text>
  <text start="828" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to see this so what</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="832.02" dur="2.939">start putting out this new curve and</text>
  <text start="833.79" dur="3.72">people gonna be looking at it go look</text>
  <text start="834.959" dur="3.961">everything&amp;#39;s fine and the Fed is gonna</text>
  <text start="837.51" dur="5.22">be out there saying we&amp;#39;re not predicting</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="5.49">anything and all the financial pundits</text>
  <text start="842.73" dur="4.29">and the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="844.41" dur="4.89">gonna go along with this and everyone</text>
  <text start="847.02" dur="4.55">else is going to be kept in the dark</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="4.83">now think about why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="851.57" dur="3.22">the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.13" dur="2.51">hiding</text>
  <text start="854.79" dur="7.38">everything that they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="9.33">they want nobody to know that they were</text>
  <text start="862.17" dur="6.45">the ones who brought this system down</text>
  <text start="865.97" dur="4.39">they can say well if we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="868.62" dur="5.73">predicting anything we have no data on</text>
  <text start="870.36" dur="6.6">this this must have been the tariffs it</text>
  <text start="874.35" dur="4.8">must have been Trump&amp;#39;s new economic</text>
  <text start="876.96" dur="5.1">policies it must have been whatever</text>
  <text start="879.15" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re going to say and we have no</text>
  <text start="882.06" dur="4.17">other data you see because what they do</text>
  <text start="884.88" dur="4.68">is they go back in time they erase</text>
  <text start="886.23" dur="4.83">everything they hide it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="889.56" dur="3">anyone to know remember quantitative</text>
  <text start="891.06" dur="3.99">easing with the m3 they just got rid of</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="2.91">it so nobody sees anything nobody knows</text>
  <text start="895.05" dur="2.43">anything</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="3.9">again we don&amp;#39;t audit their book so we</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t know what the Fed is actually</text>
  <text start="899.37" dur="6.8">doing so we see right now that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="902.58" dur="6.87">been exposed they&amp;#39;re hiding removing</text>
  <text start="906.17" dur="4.99">manipulating to cover up what is coming</text>
  <text start="909.45" dur="3.42">and they know what&amp;#39;s coming because</text>
  <text start="911.16" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re about to do it they know they</text>
  <text start="912.87" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t keep the system going and I said</text>
  <text start="914.28" dur="6.66">this for quite a while now that both</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="8.28">sides the central bank system and Trump</text>
  <text start="920.94" dur="6.63">and the Patriots who are behind him both</text>
  <text start="925.44" dur="4.98">sides are going to control try to</text>
  <text start="927.57" dur="4.61">control the narrative and the central</text>
  <text start="930.42" dur="4.98">bank is already making their move</text>
  <text start="932.18" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re already prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="935.4" dur="6.12">control this narrative of when this</text>
  <text start="937.62" dur="6.39">whole system comes down and the only way</text>
  <text start="941.52" dur="5.43">they can do it is hide everything that</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;ve done because they&amp;#39;ve know that</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="5.37">everything they&amp;#39;ve done is basically</text>
  <text start="949.67" dur="5.74">manipulation manipulation of all the</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="4.35">data manipulated the bank&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="4.47">where all the funds have gone</text>
  <text start="956.67" dur="5.3">manipulated pretty much everything so as</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="5.58">we can see they are prepped and ready</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="7.51">they&amp;#39;ve been exposed they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="6.09">new data and they&amp;#39;re about to bring this</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="4.65">whole system down they&amp;#39;re prepared and</text>
  <text start="971.55" dur="6.03">ready because they don&amp;#39;t want to take</text>
  <text start="974.13" dur="6.17">the blame the central bank wants to stay</text>
  <text start="977.58" dur="5.82">in control they don&amp;#39;t want to give it up</text>
  <text start="980.3" dur="5.08">they like being in control they need to</text>
  <text start="983.4" dur="3.85">create the currency of each and every</text>
  <text start="985.38" dur="4.84">government this way they have control</text>
  <text start="987.25" dur="5.52">over those governments and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="5.22">just gonna say okay</text>
  <text start="992.77" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re out we understand we wrecked the</text>
  <text start="995.44" dur="4.23">economy they will never admit to this</text>
  <text start="997.03" dur="4.41">they will place blame on other areas</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;ll say we had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1001.44" dur="6.69">this please keep us on because we know</text>
  <text start="1005.64" dur="4.14">how to manage an economy and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.13" dur="4.65">gonna make all these different excuses</text>
  <text start="1009.78" dur="4.92">just like they did in the 70s how there</text>
  <text start="1012.78" dur="3.15">are gold speculators coming in and this</text>
  <text start="1014.7" dur="3.06">is what we have to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="1015.93" dur="3.36">standard this is what we have to be put</text>
  <text start="1017.76" dur="3.81">onto the new system which is the</text>
  <text start="1019.29" dur="4.35">petrodollar system they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1021.57" dur="3.45">the same exact thing and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1023.64" dur="3.54">be pointing the finger just like they</text>
  <text start="1025.02" dur="3.84">did back then they pointed at all the</text>
  <text start="1027.18" dur="2.96">different countries who are speculating</text>
  <text start="1028.86" dur="3.27">and gold and all this other stuff</text>
  <text start="1030.14" dur="3.03">actually they were asking for their gold</text>
  <text start="1032.13" dur="3.12">back because they saw what was happening</text>
  <text start="1033.17" dur="5.05">the same thing is gonna happen now</text>
  <text start="1035.25" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re shaping the narrative to control</text>
  <text start="1038.22" dur="5.01">what is about to happen and it&amp;#39;s playing</text>
  <text start="1041.52" dur="2.939">out right in front of us so no matter</text>
  <text start="1043.23" dur="4.65">what we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>

  <text start="1047.88" dur="4.5">control the narrative who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1050.28" dur="4.47">control the system coming down and I</text>
  <text start="1052.38" dur="4.83">think very soon we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="1054.75" dur="6.15">Trump administration the Patriots start</text>
  <text start="1057.21" dur="7.68">to pivot on what they&amp;#39;re doing with the</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="7.38">economy and there might even start to be</text>
  <text start="1064.89" dur="6.3">calls to audit the Fed and I believe</text>
