  <text start="98.6" dur="7.59">power that they have and think about</text>
  <text start="102.759" dur="5.771">what they were trying to do remember</text>
  <text start="106.19" dur="6.15">they work in their best interest for</text>
  <text start="108.53" dur="8.899">themselves not for the people they like</text>

  <text start="146.9" dur="6.33">last time they really didn&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="7">this time I don&amp;#39;t believe they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="4.5">to do this at all but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="156.8" dur="5.31">and see</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="5.41">now remember the entire plan here is not</text>
  <text start="162.11" dur="3.37">to</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="6.84">this central bank economy the entire</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="7.41">plan here is to keep it operational long</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="5.24">enough to transition us from one system</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="6.379">to another that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="5.799">that&amp;#39;s Trump the Patriots goal</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="4.511">everything else that you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="5.791">everything else that you&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="6.929">about China about bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="6.239">agreements about giving tax write-offs</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="6.271">to small businesses and people and</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="8.181">cutting taxes that&amp;#39;s about creating a</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="8.069">new system once the central bank system</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="7.27">implodes on itself so we&amp;#39;re watching two</text>
  <text start="205.049" dur="6.33">different things happen here and it</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="5.37">seems that Goldman Sachs is getting a</text>
  <text start="211.379" dur="5.301">little lost in what is going on and</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="5.729">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="5.35">economist Peter Navarro he was on Lou</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="4.291">Dobbs and he explained how the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="6.299">doing fine and it&amp;#39;s trade negotiations</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="6.87">with China and Lou Dobbs showed a chart</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.5">prepared by Goldman Sachs that attempted</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="4.47">to show that the tariffs that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="232.829" dur="8.341">imposed on China&amp;#39;s goods were causing</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="7.349">inflation now Navarro went crazy and I</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t mean he just flipped out I mean he</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="7.081">went crazy on Goldman Sachs and I really</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="6.5">have never heard this before but he</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="5.639">looked at the chart and he said listen</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="5.02">while Goldman doesn&amp;#39;t show you is the</text>
  <text start="255.299" dur="4.981">significance of the lines in the charts</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="5.07">cost of goods are down across the board</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="4.71">and inflation is the same or lower than</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="4.29">last year since the tariffs were added</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.08">to China&amp;#39;s goods the fact is the goods</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="4.979">imported by China are an immaterial</text>
  <text start="269.07" dur="5.43">amount as noted below from our post in</text>
  <text start="272.039" dur="4.951">May and this is what he said about</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="5.95">Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="7.36">Goldman make a lot of money offshoring</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="7.02">our jobs but people in Ohio Michigan</text>
  <text start="284.35" dur="5.79">Pennsylvania Wisconsin they don&amp;#39;t much</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="5.22">care for Goldman Sachs they don&amp;#39;t salute</text>
  <text start="290.14" dur="5.28">the Goldman Sachs Flagg I can assure you</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="7.59">they salute the American flag and they</text>
  <text start="295.42" dur="7.77">support Trump so he&amp;#39;s calling out</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="5.25">Goldman Sachs remember Goldman Sachs is</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="4.2">in the business to make money and we</text>
  <text start="305.53" dur="4.19">know what they&amp;#39;ve done across the world</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="6.54">we discussed this many many times before</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="7.75">look what they did in Greece look what</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve done across the globe now very</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="5.1">interestingly we have the next</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="4.86">revolution and this is from last night</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="5.01">Steve says this is a tweet and it says</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="5.88">the Stewart snooty establishment called</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="5.46">Trump the ignoramus he was right about</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="2.64">China the entire establishment got it</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="3.54">wrong</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="5.4">now as president Trump is delivering</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="6.35">exactly the tough stands he called for</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="8.04">as a private citizen two decades ago and</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="7.36">the timing is right it&amp;#39;s time for China</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="6.27">to play fair Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="4.5">following massive amounts of money from</text>
  <text start="353.17" dur="3.84">China and other parts of the world is</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="5.25">pouring into United States for reasons</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="5.36">of safety investment and interest rates</text>
  <text start="360.04" dur="5.07">we are in a very strong position</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="5.44">companies are also coming to the u.s. in</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="6.27">big numbers a beautiful thing to watch</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="5.67">and like we said before this is part of</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="5.37">the plan this is part of the plan where</text>
  <text start="373.48" dur="6.3">he&amp;#39;s imposing tariffs on China to force</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="5.79">as many companies as possible out of</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="5.34">China and hopefully bring them back to</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="3.51">the United States which it seems like it</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="3.69">is happening now</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="4.89">the central banks they are becoming a</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="6.15">little bit nervous about what Trump is</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="7.77">doing remember they don&amp;#39;t like anyone</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="7.04">interfering in what they do now we have</text>
  <text start="398.71" dur="6.17">four former US Federal Reserve chairs</text>
  <text start="402" dur="5.71">they published an essay on Monday</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="5.59">advocating for the independence of the</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="5">institution and we know that from</text>

  <text start="424.12" dur="4.71">public criticism they said we are united</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="4.05">in the conviction that the Fed and its</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="4.08">chair must be permitted to act</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="4.11">independently and in the best interest</text>
  <text start="432.91" dur="4.02">of the economy free of short-term</text>
  <text start="435.07" dur="3.54">political pressures and in particular</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="3.99">without the threat of removal or</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="5.67">demotion of Fed leaders for political</text>
  <text start="440.92" dur="7.65">reasons they wrote which means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="6.38">nervous about what Trump might or will</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="4.77">do later on</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="4.78">remember the Fed does not want to be</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="2.79">audited the Fed does not want to be</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="3.78">interfered with</text>
  <text start="456.13" dur="4.74">the Fed is a private corporation they do</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="3.93">not work for the people of the United</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="5.25">States they work for themselves their</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="6.33">product is debt they like profits and</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="5.99">they like control that is the Federal</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="5.82">Reserve it was created back in 1913 and</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.5">we we had some type of gold standard all</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.77">the way up until the 70s when they took</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="6.14">us off the gold standard and here we are</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="6.06">today where we see massive amount of</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="4.24">currency printing and I know you just</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="3.63">push a button and it creates the</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="4.32">currency or a lot of the banks now</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="7.85">create the currency but the entire world</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="8.94">is flooded with debt and there is</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="6.7">absolutely no reason for the world to be</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="6.41">flooded with this amount of debt now who</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="6.93">pays this debt back it&amp;#39;s the people and</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="7.15">guess what to pay it back they have to</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="6.299">take out more debt because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.669">seeing around the world is austerity we</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="6.451">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs and they&amp;#39;re our</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="6.651">whole system is imploding and what Trump</text>
  <text start="523.99" dur="5.28">and the Patriots are doing is number one</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="4.959">they&amp;#39;re removing everything the</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="6.78">globalists have done number two they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="4.471">keeping this central bank system on life</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="2.67">support</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="4.32">making sure it doesn&amp;#39;t collapse because</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="5.219">think about it if it collapsed tomorrow</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="4.619">or right before the election</text>
  <text start="543.939" dur="3.63">everything the Patriots have been</text>
  <text start="545.499" dur="7.05">working for goes down the drain</text>
  <text start="547.569" dur="7.38">period that&amp;#39;s it because the people of</text>
  <text start="552.549" dur="5.52">the United States if they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="554.949" dur="5.04">jobs if the system is not working they</text>
  <text start="558.069" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t have money in the bank if their</text>
  <text start="559.989" dur="6.78">house loses value guess what this is</text>
  <text start="564.429" dur="4.89">when everyone wakes up this is when</text>
  <text start="566.769" dur="5.31">everyone realizes hey I don&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="569.319" dur="6.18">I don&amp;#39;t want this I want something</text>
  <text start="572.079" dur="6.9">different this is why Trump continually</text>
  <text start="575.499" dur="6.57">tweets out over and over and over how</text>
  <text start="578.979" dur="4.741">great the economy is look at the</text>
  <text start="582.069" dur="3.901">unemployment numbers look at the GDP</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="5.309">numbers look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="5.909">look I&amp;#39;m telling the Fed if you do this</text>
  <text start="589.029" dur="8.67">it will be a lot better for the American</text>
  <text start="591.879" dur="8.91">people and what is happening the Fed is</text>
  <text start="597.699" dur="6.72">doing exactly what he wants the Fed is</text>
  <text start="600.789" dur="7.74">following along he has trapped them now</text>
  <text start="604.419" dur="8.07">and this is being done on purpose now if</text>
  <text start="608.529" dur="6.12">we see any dip in the market trumpet</text>
  <text start="612.489" dur="4.92">will just come out and say listen yes</text>
  <text start="614.649" dur="4.14">the market went up thanks but the</text>
  <text start="617.409" dur="3.96">Federal Reserve they should have done</text>
  <text start="618.789" dur="5.46">more they should have cut the rates by</text>
  <text start="621.369" dur="6.06">half not a quarter and we already know</text>
  <text start="624.249" dur="4.8">that the Fed already has this baked in</text>
  <text start="627.429" dur="4.11">the books that they&amp;#39;ll be cutting the</text>
  <text start="629.049" dur="4.74">rate later on this year and they will</text>
  <text start="631.539" dur="5.88">start stimulus and we can see already</text>
  <text start="633.789" dur="5.57">the market is rebounding gold is way up</text>
  <text start="637.419" dur="6.27">this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="639.359" dur="8.68">let gold rise a little bit at a time</text>
  <text start="643.689" dur="8.18">I can&amp;#39;t let gold go from 1400 to 5,000</text>
  <text start="648.039" dur="6.15">it would freak the entire system out</text>
  <text start="651.869" dur="5.08">actually Gold probably is much much</text>
  <text start="654.189" dur="5.04">higher than that but if you let gold</text>
  <text start="656.949" dur="5.16">rise a little bit at a time like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.229" dur="8.1">doing right now people don&amp;#39;t notice it</text>
  <text start="662.109" dur="6.84">that much people don&amp;#39;t freak out think</text>
  <text start="667.329" dur="4.2">about what the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="668.949" dur="4.98">doing and the deep state think about</text>
  <text start="671.529" dur="5.631">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing over time slowly</text>
  <text start="673.929" dur="6.841">moving the jobs out of this country</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="6.91">slowly implementing globalist trade</text>
  <text start="680.77" dur="7.08">deals they do it very very slowly very</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="6.3">methodically so nobody realizes what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.85" dur="5.76">really going on until it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="690.37" dur="7.08">Trump has just flipped this around he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="6.57">doing exactly what they have done but in</text>
  <text start="697.45" dur="5.52">the opposite way and he has to</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="5.969">accelerate this a little bit more so</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="5.119">than what the central bank in deep State</text>
  <text start="706.149" dur="6.291">have been doing over the many many years</text>
  <text start="708.089" dur="8.111">because Trump realizes that this system</text>
  <text start="712.44" dur="6.459">will not be able to continue the way it</text>
  <text start="716.2" dur="4.71">is actually Europe right now</text>
  <text start="718.899" dur="6.931">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="720.91" dur="6.75">think about back in 1929 was it the US</text>
