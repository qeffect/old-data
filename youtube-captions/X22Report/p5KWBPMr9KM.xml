  <text start="122.17" dur="4.559">into a recession now i&amp;#39;m going to say</text>
  <text start="123.46" dur="6.86">the eurozone has not ever left a</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="6.29">recession most of the countries are</text>
  <text start="130.32" dur="6.21">completely imploding on themselves I</text>
  <text start="133.019" dur="5.771">mean Greece is right back in a recession</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="4.81">so they really haven&amp;#39;t left but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.79" dur="4.71">using the idea that they&amp;#39;ve left the</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="6.48">recession and if they move back into</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="7.89">recession it&amp;#39;s not clear that the euro</text>
  <text start="147.82" dur="4.88">area would endure he said that there are</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="5.01">worrying signs of deterioration</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="5.409">emanating from Europe economies these</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="6.08">include height and credit stress in the</text>
  <text start="158.109" dur="6.271">bank sector and market volatility so</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="3.31">basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="3.06">at this point is they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="5.1">everyone that there could be problems</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="5.76">ahead and if there are problems the</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="6.12">economy might not be able to weather</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="5.01">through this and we know that it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="4.2">be able to weather through this because</text>
  <text start="178.21" dur="4.32">the economy&amp;#39;s never recovered basically</text>
  <text start="181.21" dur="6.12">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="8.06">setting us up to explain away why</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="5.49">everything is going to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="4.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="192.82" dur="6.74">everything is fine now and when it does</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="9.15">fall apart we have an explanation for it</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="10.69">now Britain is fighting this battle</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="7.8">about staying with the EU exiting the EU</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="4.17">and of course they&amp;#39;re using a lot of</text>
  <text start="212.17" dur="4.71">fear tactics like Britain would be</text>
  <text start="214.42" dur="4.77">weaker less safe if they leave it</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="4.56">wouldn&amp;#39;t be good and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="5.31">continually do this and they did the</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="6.08">same thing with Greece now we know the</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="6.95">central bankers would love to have one</text>
  <text start="227.52" dur="6.4">currency it&amp;#39;s easier to control for them</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="4.63">they would like to have control over all</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="3.69">the countries that would make it a lot</text>
  <text start="236.08" dur="4.02">easier think about what the European</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="4.47">Union has done they have created this</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="6.18">one currency the sovereignty of each</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="7.79">country basically disappeared they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="6.09">going to control what the countries do</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re going to create their own police</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="4.35">force which they&amp;#39;ve already done and</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.47">they would like to do this for the rest</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="6.03">of the world and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.17" dur="7.77">trying to keep the EU together at this</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="8.04">point now here in the United States ATP</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="7.92">they came out with their employment</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="8.21">report and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="6.63">employment fell back to a more normal</text>
  <text start="279" dur="7.09">200,000 ish level in January and now in</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="8.27">February it rises once again to 214,000</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="8.579">and January was revised down from</text>
  <text start="290.76" dur="6.25">205,000 and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="3.601">continually playing with these numbers</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="3.9">now magnify</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="7.17">tring jobs according to ADP remain</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="7.68">relatively flat for last year they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="6.72">down 9,000 in February this is the</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5.13">second largest drop in five years but</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.74">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="5.34">manufacturing we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="5.13">how manufacturing is imploding we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="4.32">been talking about how the is M Annja</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="6.27">factoring is employing index has fallen</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="7.37">sharply now ADP has manufactured and</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="7.11">employment moving up or flatlined and</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="8.49">the is M manufacturing employment has</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="8.61">plummeted so someone somewhere is</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="5.29">manipulating some numbers here and we</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="6.69">know there is probably a lot of pressure</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="7.2">on adp to keep the numbers looking good</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="4.2">we know the US government does this</text>
  <text start="354.4" dur="3.84">quite a bit with their employment</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="4.68">numbers because they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="358.24" dur="5.13">to know that the economy is a lot worse</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="6.69">than what they&amp;#39;re saying they did the</text>
  <text start="363.37" dur="6.9">same thing prior to 2008-2009 crash they</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="4.95">tried to convince everyone at that time</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="3.75">that we were doing much much better than</text>
  <text start="372.79" dur="6.21">we really were they were basically</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="6.66">hiding everything they even told America</text>
  <text start="379" dur="5.25">well I should say the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="7.47">bankers told America they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="7.59">forecasting a recession in the year the</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="6">recession started it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="3.96">amazing they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="394.15" dur="3.54">once again now sports authority as</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="4.2">everyone knows because it&amp;#39;s plastered</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="5.37">all over the place they have declared</text>
  <text start="400" dur="5.55">bankruptcy they&amp;#39;re closing one-third of</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="7.47">their stores that&amp;#39;s about 140 stores of</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="8.37">the 463 locations and you know once they</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="5.94">close these stores it&amp;#39;s a domino effect</text>
  <text start="413.92" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to be closing even more</text>
  <text start="416.47" dur="3.48">stores because guess what do you really</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="3">think the economy is just going to</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="5.34">bounce back and improve and people going</text>
  <text start="421.54" dur="6.96">to go for and start to purchase goods at</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="6.09">the sports authority know as time goes</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="3.21">on and as more and more people lose</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="3.36">their</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="5.1">jobs they have less discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="3.99">a lot of people getting nervous because</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="3.27">in those corporations they see people</text>
  <text start="438.73" dur="3.09">laying off and they&amp;#39;re saying oh am i</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="5.16">next I better not spending any money</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="5.55">right now and this spreads to more and</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="4.02">more people so now we have a hundred and</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="5.61">forty stores closing these people are</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="6.78">going to be out of work and we see more</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="6.24">layoffs are coming IBM they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="456.04" dur="6.86">layoffs are coming in many various</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="7.62">locations the Pittsburgh post-gazette</text>

  <text start="466.84" dur="6.57">coming this is continuing it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="5.34">accelerate as we move throughout this</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="5.1">year we&amp;#39;re going to see more layoffs and</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="6.68">if you really think about it going back</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="10.67">to June of 2014 the two this January of</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="9.07">2016 there are a million plus layoffs</text>
  <text start="489.18" dur="7.42">that is a lot of layoffs and these were</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="6.18">good full-time high-paying jobs most of</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="6.18">these people are having a very rough</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="6.48">time finding the same job at the same</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="4.26">pay some of them can&amp;#39;t even find it at</text>
  <text start="504.97" dur="4.68">all so they&amp;#39;re taking part time work and</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="4.83">as time goes on you&amp;#39;re going to see more</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="5.36">foreclosures you&amp;#39;re going to see more</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="5.67">delinquencies for cars for housing and</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.54" dur="3.72">seeing that mortgage applications they</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="5.79">have fallen by four point eight percent</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="7.97">and we can see at this point the</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="7.5">mortgage apps that have been taken out</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="5.89">from last year to this year or the</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="5.94">previous year it&amp;#39;s pretty much flatlined</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="6.18">and we&amp;#39;re seeing a downward trend it</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="4.92">really hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere because most</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="4.32">of the purchases right now are not</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="5.31">coming from the American person it is</text>
  <text start="545.62" dur="4.56">coming from foreign investors hedge</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="5.85">funds investment companies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="7.56">paying cash now we know the</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="7.08">manufacturing numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="5.43">horrific we&amp;#39;re seeing factories they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.4" dur="3.96">shedding jobs at the fastest pace since</text>
  <text start="563.17" dur="4.409">the last financial crisis</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="6.03">we see the Chinese economy which has a</text>
  <text start="567.579" dur="5.94">huge manufacturing base they are laying</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="5.48">off millions of people because you have</text>
  <text start="573.519" dur="6.271">to remember if they&amp;#39;re manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="6.63">their entire economy is made up of</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="6.359">manufacturing and the consumerism States</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="6.64">countries i should say are not</text>
  <text start="586.149" dur="8.461">purchasing their manufacturing is going</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="6.81">to decline united states europe with</text>
  <text start="594.61" dur="6.71">high unemployment with a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="8.61">debt with layoffs coming left and right</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="5.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing a drop in purchasing this</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="4.23">is why stores are closing this is why</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="5.1">retail is folding at this point this is</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="4.71">why factories in the US are not</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="4.97">producing and this has a ripple effect</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="5.51">in too many different countries and</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this spread and</text>
  <text start="620.01" dur="6.31">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="4.84">remember seventy percent of the world</text>
  <text start="626.32" dur="4.62">saw a manufacturing sentiment</text>
  <text start="628.06" dur="6.66">deteriorate in February compared to</text>
  <text start="630.94" dur="7.44">January at this point unemployment rates</text>
  <text start="634.72" dur="5.28">and thirty-six states are higher than</text>
  <text start="638.38" dur="6">they wore just before the last recession</text>
  <text start="640" dur="6.209">hit in 2008 36 states since the last</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="6.209">recession have not recovered their</text>
  <text start="646.209" dur="6.541">unemployment rates are higher still now</text>
  <text start="650.589" dur="6.481">remember they changed the way they</text>
  <text start="652.75" dur="6.12">calculate unemployment since 2008</text>
  <text start="657.07" dur="3.48">because they had to manipulate they had</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="4.579">a massage in numbers but we look at</text>
  <text start="660.55" dur="5.64">states like Alabama Alaska Arizona</text>
  <text start="663.449" dur="4.931">California Colorado Connecticut Delaware</text>
  <text start="666.19" dur="6.509">New Jersey New York Florida Georgia</text>
  <text start="668.38" dur="8.25">Hawaii and so on these states their</text>
  <text start="672.699" dur="8.671">unemployment is much higher than it was</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="6.84">during 2008 and we have to remember if</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="3.54">we go by the governmental numbers of</text>
  <text start="683.47" dur="5.309">today comparing to the governmental</text>
  <text start="684.91" dur="5.789">numbers of 2008 it&amp;#39;s a completely</text>
  <text start="688.779" dur="3.93">different calculation so these numbers</text>
  <text start="690.699" dur="4.771">today even though they&amp;#39;re higher I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="692.709" dur="6.081">give you an example like Arizona their</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="5.78">unemployment rate prior on to the</text>
  <text start="698.79" dur="4.5">entire crash in 2008 was</text>
  <text start="701.25" dur="4.41">three-point-nine percent today it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="703.29" dur="5.76">6.1 percent but remember that number is</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="6.45">manipulated just like the four point</text>
  <text start="709.05" dur="4.73">nine percent that the u.s. is reporting</text>
  <text start="712.11" dur="4.35">saying that we&amp;#39;re in full employment</text>
  <text start="713.78" dur="4.66">that number is completely manipulated we</text>
  <text start="716.46" dur="4.23">know that number is much much higher if</text>
