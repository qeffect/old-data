  <text start="169.48" dur="5.06">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy for</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="7.029">quite a while since 2008 where we were</text>
  <text start="178.45" dur="4.71">looking at retail housing we were</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="3.481">looking at all the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="3.57">and we&amp;#39;re doing this for a reason it</text>
  <text start="185.05" dur="2.49">wasn&amp;#39;t say oh the collapse was coming</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="2.67">tomorrow</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="5.58">we never really put a time stamp on</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="6.919">anything we watched how the central bank</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="6.239">how the government continually</text>
  <text start="196.319" dur="5.081">manipulated the economy to make us</text>
  <text start="199.359" dur="5.091">believe that we&amp;#39;re in recovery now</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="6">throughout the Obama regime they were</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="6.19">manipulating like crazy now we were</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="5.72">showing retail housing and many other</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="5.599">things how they were slowly declining</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="5.14">retail was declining quite quickly</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="4.511">especially during the holiday season now</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="3.99">of course the mainstream media they were</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="3.54">using the excuse that it was weather oh</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="4.889">it was bad weather it was rainy it was</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="5.009">snowy and what happened was retail</text>
  <text start="227.139" dur="4.891">continually declined during nice weather</text>
  <text start="229.299" dur="4.741">so that story didn&amp;#39;t fit anymore</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="4.26">so then they had to move to online sales</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="4.589">Amazon is taking away all sales now</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="3.779">remember all these retailers they have</text>
  <text start="238.629" dur="5.461">online print they have an online</text>
  <text start="240.069" dur="6.361">presence and even the stores who have an</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.649">online presence very easy to use they</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="3.869">still couldn&amp;#39;t make it and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="3.36">that oh you know what we&amp;#39;re gonna shut</text>
  <text start="250.299" dur="5.31">down all brick-and-mortar and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="252.099" dur="5.281">gonna have online sales an online</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="3.75">presence no what happened was they</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.38">weren&amp;#39;t completely bankrupt because</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="4.28">their model didn&amp;#39;t work what was their</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="4.95">model your model was to sell to people</text>
  <text start="263.639" dur="5.381">guess what happened the people they</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t have jobs or they got fired from</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="5.34">their high-paying jobs and they had to</text>
  <text start="271" dur="5.76">take on part-time jobs wages were not</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="4.98">moving up but the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="4.62">continued declined and now they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="4.23">there complaining Walmart Target Gap</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="6.48">Best Buy and many others saying that if</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="6.45">these tariffs take effect we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="3.42">start losing a lot more sales know what</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re projecting</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="4.41">letting you know they&amp;#39;re gonna be losing</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="3.899">sales matter if the tariffs were there</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.68">or not didn&amp;#39;t make a difference because</text>
  <text start="297.699" dur="5.731">it happened year after year and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="5.85">happening right now is the entire system</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="4.65">is employing people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs</text>
  <text start="306.22" dur="3.689">what Trump is doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="3.99">manipulating the numbers to make</text>
  <text start="309.909" dur="3.961">everyone believe the economy is doing a</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="4.469">lot better than it is and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.01">done on purpose this way they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="3.851">blame him and those in his</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="4.63">administration for bringing</text>
  <text start="320.39" dur="4.86">down the economy now these retailers</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="4.26">have been having the same exact problem</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="5.13">for a very long time I mean Target close</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="5.13">all their stores in Canada Walmart</text>
  <text start="330.38" dur="5">closed many other stores Best Buy is</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="5.67">getting rid of their tiny stores and</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="5.14">sales have been dropping they have been</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.65">all going to Amazon if that was the case</text>
  <text start="340.52" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;d be multi trillion-dollar business</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="4.8">right now because this is a trillion</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.88">dollar industry and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="6.03">these duties that are going to come into</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.59">effect by year end it&amp;#39;s going to affect</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="2.91">everything after the holiday season now</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="4.65">this holiday season probably won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="5.19">that great and when we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="4.02">that everything&amp;#39;s starting to break down</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="5.25">now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="6.54">I mean if you go back in time every time</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="5.82">the government raised the federal tax</text>
  <text start="370.7" dur="6.48">rate or States raised their tax rate</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="6.78">guess what people were still purchasing</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="4.74">in retail stores actually they were</text>
  <text start="380" dur="4.8">expanding at a time when they were</text>
  <text start="381.92" dur="5.91">raising sales tax that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="5.73">interesting now they&amp;#39;re complaining that</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="7.77">this is going to destroy their whole</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="6.81">entire business really is it if the</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="5.43">economy was strong and people actually</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="5.25">had jobs high-paying jobs not part-time</text>
  <text start="401.03" dur="4.64">jobs we have a hundred million people</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="6.39">out of the workforce actually over that</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="6.07">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be having a problem the</text>
  <text start="408.98" dur="5.76">problem is is that the value of the</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="4.26">dollar has them in decreasing and if the</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="2.61">value of the dollar is decreasing it</text>
  <text start="416" dur="4.26">takes a lot more dollars to pay for that</text>
  <text start="417.35" dur="6.39">piece of merchandise and if your wages</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="7.83">aren&amp;#39;t moving up to keep up with</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="5.94">inflation people have a problem if you</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="2.76">don&amp;#39;t find a high paying job and you</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="3.6">come from a high paying job and you go</text>
  <text start="430.85" dur="4.2">to a lower paying job or you have to get</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="3.87">a part-time job you&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="3.87">able to spend money in these stores even</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="3.96">online it&amp;#39;s going to be completely</text>
  <text start="438.92" dur="6.35">impossible and this is what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="8.58">seeing but they&amp;#39;re projecting out there</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="6.88">the idea that these tariffs are going to</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.56">bring down their business no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing retail too</text>
  <text start="454.25" dur="4.14">for a very long time actually it was</text>
  <text start="456.62" dur="3.33">declining when people told us it was</text>
  <text start="458.39" dur="3.84">perfectly strong and then all of a</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="4.35">sudden the retail apocalypse hit and</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="5.61">then people started to realize we were</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="4.89">having a huge problem here and then all</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="3.84">of a sudden they acknowledged that</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="5.07">retail was in trouble and that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="5.16">people are not getting the jobs they</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t have the pay anymore people coming</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="3.84">out of college they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="3.8">difficult time paying their student</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="4.29">loans is that because of tariffs no</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re not paying their loans because</text>
  <text start="484.97" dur="4.95">they don&amp;#39;t have a job especially the one</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="2.37">they thought they were going to have</text>
  <text start="489.92" dur="4.08">coming out of college they might have</text>
  <text start="491.42" dur="5.76">gotten a lower payer job or a part time</text>
  <text start="494" dur="4.5">job but it makes it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="3.06">pay for that student loan and this is</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="4.2">why they adjusted the student loans to</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="4.74">make it easier for people it said okay</text>
  <text start="502.7" dur="4.14">how much you&amp;#39;re making fifteen sixteen</text>
  <text start="504.98" dur="4.74">dollars an hour all right we&amp;#39;ll readjust</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="4.89">the student loans and we&amp;#39;ll put it out</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="4.47">you know 25 30 years then you can pay</text>
  <text start="511.73" dur="4.98">for it this is why we went through many</text>
  <text start="514.19" dur="4.229">stages through the economy and you can</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="3.87">really see the stages in the central</text>
  <text start="518.419" dur="4.651">bank economy there was a time where</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="3.9">everyone just paid cash and then all of</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="3.72">a sudden the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="5.76">decreased and it really accelerated in</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.799">the 70s 80s 90s and when you say it</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="3.72">purchased a car people used to purchase</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="4.291">cat purchase a car in cash then we had</text>
  <text start="533.96" dur="3.9">to moved to financing was like 36 months</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="4.38">48 months then they had to make it 60</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="4.229">months and 72 months and guess what it</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="3.72">just got too expensive so then had moved</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="3.421">to leasing that brought the price down</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="4.62">because we&amp;#39;re really renting a car when</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="5.07">you lease and now it&amp;#39;s getting to the</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="4.73">point where they have to come up with</text>
  <text start="550.58" dur="6.03">some other strategy to get you in and</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="5.32">make it so you can afford a car and this</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="3.24">is what happens over time this is why</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="3.18">they have to bring in the subprime</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="4.86">people this is why they have to keep</text>
  <text start="561.83" dur="5.28">manipulating all this to make these type</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="4.74">of purchases affordable at least in your</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="4.07">mind all they did was make you rent</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="4.29">something where you used to own it and</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="4.03">you can see this through housing you can</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="4.11">see it with student loans you can see it</text>
  <text start="575.21" dur="5.85">with everything but what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="577.85" dur="6.03">right now is the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="5.67">economy forget about the statistical</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="4.41">numbers we have to talk reality now</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="3.87">I mean you can change anything you can</text>
  <text start="588.29" dur="4.799">take you know the GDP numbers like Trump</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="4.56">did and offset them by a trillion and</text>
  <text start="593.089" dur="3.511">make it look fantastic does that mean</text>
  <text start="595.16" dur="5.669">the economy&amp;#39;s really doing better</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="6.63">no we&amp;#39;re seeing the housing market well</text>
  <text start="600.829" dur="5.88">it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="5.039">another crisis for several years the</text>
  <text start="606.709" dur="3.331">housing market has been one of the</text>
  <text start="608.269" dur="4.831">bright spots of the US economy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.04" dur="5.4">because they manipulated the housing</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="4.169">market they pumped up the bubbles home</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="4.079">prices especially and the hottest</text>
  <text start="617.269" dur="4.68">markets on the east and west coast have</text>
  <text start="619.519" dur="4.62">been soaring but now that has completely</text>
  <text start="621.949" dur="4.231">changed and some sellers are cutting</text>
  <text start="624.139" dur="4.95">prices at a pace that we have not seen</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="4.589">since the last recession in case you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.089" dur="4.62">wondering this is definitely a major red</text>
  <text start="630.769" dur="6.481">flag for the economy and when we look at</text>
  <text start="633.709" dur="6.331">the home prices we see that they are</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="5.43">dropping now according to redfin more</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="5.37">than one out of every four homes for</text>
  <text start="642.68" dur="4.56">sale in America had a price drop within</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="4.47">the most recent four week period of</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="5.07">course the reason why prices are being</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="4.769">dropped is because homes are not selling</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="5.009">the supply of homes available for sale</text>
  <text start="654.649" dur="5.821">is shooting up and that is good news for</text>
  <text start="657.319" dur="7.2">buyers but bad news for sellers this</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="5.46">happened back in 2008 a lot of people</text>
  <text start="664.519" dur="4.951">were putting the houses on the market</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="5.73">but guess what the prices were too high</text>
  <text start="669.47" dur="3.9">they started to come down people started</text>
  <text start="671.66" dur="3.81">to pull all their houses off the market</text>
  <text start="673.37" dur="3.959">then we had a shortage of houses but</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="3.15">people didn&amp;#39;t want to pie the houses</text>
  <text start="677.329" dur="3.69">because they saw the prices coming down</text>
  <text start="678.62" dur="3.54">so they waited until they reached a</text>
  <text start="681.019" dur="3.091">certain level where they thought they</text>
  <text start="682.16" dur="3.299">were going to be comfortable but people</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="3.63">continually pulled their houses off the</text>
  <text start="685.459" dur="4.051">market this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="4.079">right now and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="689.51" dur="4.559">prices come down and they&amp;#39;re gonna come</text>
  <text start="691.819" dur="3.931">down quite quickly because the whole</text>
  <text start="694.069" dur="4.26">thing was pumped up and it was gigantic</text>
  <text start="695.75" dur="4.5">bubble and Bank of America they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="698.329" dur="4.44">there calling it they&amp;#39;re saying this is</text>
  <text start="700.25" dur="7.38">the peak in home sales it has been</text>
  <text start="702.769" dur="8.401">reached so that means we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="6.66">heading to the downside in homes and</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="4.159">we&amp;#39;re already seeing it just like we saw</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="5.159">it in retail</text>
  <text start="715.329" dur="5.381">now remember Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="719.449" dur="3.721">manipulating the economy</text>
  <text start="720.71" dur="3.72">to make everyone believe the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="723.17" dur="3.57">doing well he&amp;#39;s actually using the deep</text>
  <text start="724.43" dur="4.53">state the central bank tools against</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="3.63">them because they really can&amp;#39;t come out</text>
  <text start="728.96" dur="4.31">and say hey you&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="730.37" dur="5.01">economy you change GDP you&amp;#39;re changing</text>
  <text start="733.27" dur="3.49">unemployment we know what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="735.38" dur="4.65">they can&amp;#39;t come out and say that because</text>
  <text start="736.76" dur="4.62">Obama did this the president before him</text>
  <text start="740.03" dur="3.75">did this and the president before him</text>
  <text start="741.38" dur="3.54">did this and they can&amp;#39;t come out and say</text>
  <text start="743.78" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re manipulating something because</text>
  <text start="744.92" dur="4.77">all you have to do is say hey I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="746.78" dur="5.1">the same calculation as Obama so if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="4.68">manipulating it then he manipulated it</text>
  <text start="751.88" dur="5.79">and they don&amp;#39;t want to do this and this</text>
  <text start="754.37" dur="5.4">is why he&amp;#39;s able to manipulate it in a</text>
  <text start="757.67" dur="4.59">certain way where the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="5.76">they can&amp;#39;t do anything about it and I do</text>
  <text start="762.26" dur="4.74">believe the central bank the Fed the</text>
  <text start="765.53" dur="3.84">person that he put in there Powell is</text>
  <text start="767" dur="4.86">working with him to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="5.01">to bring down the system now the central</text>
  <text start="771.86" dur="3.66">banks like the IMF the biz they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="774.38" dur="2.76">there they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="3.21">narrative any way they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="777.14" dur="4.8">this is what they always do they always</text>

  <text start="812.39" dur="3.66">the finger at all different places</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="3.39">actually the business out there and this</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="3.99">is the Bank of International Settlements</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="4.62">is the bank of all banks and what</text>
  <text start="820.04" dur="6.02">they&amp;#39;re saying right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="821.9" dur="7.05">warning that for decades that these</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="5.41">firms these businesses these zombie</text>
  <text start="828.95" dur="3.93">firms because of low interest rates wait</text>
  <text start="831.47" dur="3.14">who set the low interest rates oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="832.88" dur="4.23">right it was the central banks again</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re saying that these zombie firms</text>
  <text start="837.11" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re rising to all-time highs since</text>
  <text start="840.38" dur="2.85">the 80s</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="3.71">threatening economic growth and</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="4.95">preventing interest rates from rising</text>
  <text start="844.99" dur="4.93">that&amp;#39;s why they can&amp;#39;t get the interest</text>
  <text start="848.18" dur="4.5">rates where they want them it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="4.5">of these zombie firms well they lowered</text>
  <text start="852.68" dur="3.719">the rates actually Europe during the</text>
  <text start="854.42" dur="3.18">negative territory here in the United</text>
  <text start="856.399" dur="3.271">States they continually lowered him</text>
  <text start="857.6" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re bringing them up now and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.67" dur="3.63">for a whole different reason but what</text>
  <text start="861.62" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the central</text>
  <text start="863.3" dur="3.45">banks they are trying to shift the</text>
  <text start="865.13" dur="4.5">narrow to remember their whole entire</text>
  <text start="866.75" dur="6.06">plan was to have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="869.63" dur="4.73">so they can blame all of this on that</text>
  <text start="872.81" dur="4.92">event and it was gonna be war</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="5.02">this way they can say oh you have to</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="3.87">sacrifice you have to tighten your belt</text>
  <text start="879.38" dur="4.199">we&amp;#39;re not getting the food credits</text>
  <text start="881.6" dur="4.59">freezing up and this is because of war</text>
  <text start="883.579" dur="4.741">everything has moved towards war</text>
  <text start="886.19" dur="4.079">production this is why we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
