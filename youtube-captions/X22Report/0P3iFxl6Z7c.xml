  <text start="72.27" dur="4.98">collapse financial news now today we can</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="4.74">see the market well it completely</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="4.89">crashed on all this news about Trump I</text>
  <text start="80.01" dur="5.31">guess he figured out a way to bring the</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="6.42">economy down because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="5.67">right now is that the stock market well</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="4.89">that has fallen by 370 points now we</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="3.629">know that the plunge Protection Team the</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="3.93">high-frequency traders they can</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.651">completely control the market they can</text>

  <text start="99.27" dur="3.93">they can do whatever they want it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="5.25">computer programming the Fed has</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="7.14">complete control of the entire thing but</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="7.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that the</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="7.08">central bank the US government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="5.73">trying to explain away why the economy</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.059">has never taken off and why the economy</text>
  <text start="119.58" dur="2.52">is not doing well</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="4.141">and we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="5.76">important and I said this in past</text>
  <text start="124.62" dur="6.359">reports the corporate media is going to</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="5.34">let you know when the economy is going</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.951">to fall apart because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.37">start reporting on certain news stories</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="5.369">on how the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="138.57" dur="5.13">because what they are doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.299" dur="4.711">setting up the propaganda for the</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="4.71">central bank for the deep state to</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="4.259">explain this way and why it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="3.299">Trump&amp;#39;s fault or maybe another country</text>
  <text start="150.269" dur="5.28">it all depends on how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="6.631">and they will start with certain news</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="6.121">broadcasts and they&amp;#39;ll start telling you</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.73">the economy is not doing well and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="5.19">actually getting some information and</text>
  <text start="164.07" dur="5.699">some news that they&amp;#39;ve already started</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="5.46">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="169.769" dur="3.841">central bankers they love debt now every</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="2.4">time the corporate media comes out there</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="3.06">and they tell you great news</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="4.68">debt is expanding more people have more</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="4.62">debt that&amp;#39;s not good news it&amp;#39;s good news</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.52">for the central bank&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="5.45">news for the people because if you know</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="3.68">what debt is and you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="4.47">lot of debt you know the feeling it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="5.3">not good because you can&amp;#39;t make the</text>
  <text start="191.21" dur="3.84">payments but for the central bank it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="3.1">incredible</text>
  <text start="195.05" dur="4.56">now the reporting that the total debt</text>
  <text start="197" dur="4.44">held by the US household well it has</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="4.65">reached twelve point seven three</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="3.45">trillion in the first quarter of 2020</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.29">seventeen</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="8.57">now this surpassed the twelve point six</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="8.64">eight trillion peak that reached in 2008</text>
  <text start="213.46" dur="6.43">this is not good now this is coming from</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="5.97">New York feds latest quarterly report on</text>
  <text start="219.89" dur="6.12">household debt yes they love this this</text>
  <text start="223.16" dur="6.39">is incredible but this tells us that</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="7.65">people are at their max just like they</text>
  <text start="229.55" dur="5.55">were back in 2008 now this marked a four</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="4.8">hundred and seventy nine billion</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="5.01">increase from a year ago and up one</text>
  <text start="238.46" dur="3.08">hundred and forty nine billion from the</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="4.23">fourth quarter of 2016</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="5.41">think about all the jobs that have been</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="3.87">lost think about all the corporations</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="2.52">that have been laying off think about</text>
  <text start="248.21" dur="3.81">all the retail stores that have been</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="5.4">closing and all these people who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.02" dur="5.37">find jobs what do they end up doing they</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="4.86">live off of debt because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="3.599">income coming in and this is the only</text>
  <text start="259.73" dur="4.53">way they can survive until they can find</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="6.331">another job or they survive by receiving</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="6.06">unemployment insurance and and basically</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="6.18">countering it with debt and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="4.68">seeing right now is that this sign right</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="3.95">here that they&amp;#39;re out there telling</text>
  <text start="275" dur="5.22">everyone that it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="277.45" dur="5.05">this is another indicator that things</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="3.69">are rapidly falling apart now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.5" dur="3.96">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="3.66">that Wells Fargo which is the biggest US</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="5.91">mortgage lender</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="9.9">well they reported a historic collapse</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="8.01">in new mortgage applications which shows</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="4.56">us that the American people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="4.41">going out and they&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="4.59">houses like they&amp;#39;re telling us so</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="4.02">something&amp;#39;s wrong here because what</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that mortgages are</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="5.1">declining but they keep trying to</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="4.23">convince us that housing purchases well</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re doing fantastic but we know how</text>
  <text start="315.41" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s done we know that is done through</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="4.83">hedge funds and investment companies</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="5.1">through foreign investors from banks not</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="4.41">releasing the foreclosed houses onto the</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="3.45">market and the hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="3.48">companies are keeping those houses Ulta</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="3.66">market to drive the prices up but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.28" dur="4.71">very interesting about the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="6.51">report it has to do with credit</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="6.96">inquiries credit demand and remember</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="5.73">back in 2008 the credit per household</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="5.79">reached all-time new highs now we</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="7.56">surpass that but right after that things</text>
  <text start="348.74" dur="7.98">started to go south and credit inquiries</text>
  <text start="352.58" dur="6.75">credit demand collapsed we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="4.95">same thing right now remember a couple</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="5.94">reports ago we talked about how all of a</text>
  <text start="361.67" dur="5.85">sudden credit completely collapsed and</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="5.7">the New York Fed reported on it and this</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="6.24">actually shows that credit is collapsing</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="5.64">right now unexpectedly they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="373.76" dur="4.88">now it is expected because we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="5.34">auto loans while the demand for that</text>
  <text start="378.64" dur="5.98">declining credit card demand declining</text>
  <text start="381.95" dur="6.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing business loans commercial</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="7.92">bank loans declining and what this means</text>
  <text start="388.91" dur="8.43">is that we seen this before we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="392.54" dur="8.1">this prior to 2008 we&amp;#39;re seeing it once</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="3.96">again and it&amp;#39;s all falling apart right</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="4.47">in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="6.72">now housing is continually getting worse</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="6.05">and worse remember during the spring and</text>
  <text start="408.02" dur="6.33">summer months this is the hot season for</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="4.81">housing real estate normally does very</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="4.2">very well during this period of time the</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="4.92">weather is warmer and it&amp;#39;s a lot easier</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="4.05">to move into a home but mortgage</text>
  <text start="420.89" dur="4.97">applications right now they drop by</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="5.64">negative four point one percent and</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="4.87">refinancing is also dropped by negative</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="5.03">five point seven percent so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.73" dur="6">seeing right now is that there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="6.1">uptick in mortgage applications which</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="4.83">means there is no uptick in housing</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="3.93">purchases which actually the data that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="3.63">coming back to us is showing that new</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="3.81">starts are down existing home sales are</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="4.62">down and we can see that this is going</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="6.15">to continue yes they move up and down a</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="4.71">little bit but the trend is down now the</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="3.6">central bankers are coming up</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="4.619">with this brand-new theory because they</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="4.2">can&amp;#39;t explain why the economy is not</text>
  <text start="459.139" dur="4.231">doing well why all the retail stores are</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="4.05">closing and no one&amp;#39;s purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="2.19">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure all this</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="3.66">out</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="4.079">well we know why it&amp;#39;s because everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="3">getting laid off</text>
  <text start="469.639" dur="4.891">nobody has disposable income everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="4.829">making less and less money more and more</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="3.93">corporations they&amp;#39;re looking to lay off</text>
  <text start="476.599" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s more bankruptcies of retail</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="6.299">stores and they&amp;#39;re saying well all of</text>
  <text start="481.759" dur="5.851">this is because the older generation</text>
  <text start="484.759" dur="6.871">well they&amp;#39;re not spending their</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="6.869">retirement they&amp;#39;re hoarding it and this</text>
  <text start="491.63" dur="5.48">is the problem because a report from</text>
  <text start="494.479" dur="5.22">money management United income is</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="5.649">arguing that American retirees are</text>
  <text start="499.699" dur="6.09">saving too much money rather than too</text>
  <text start="502.759" dur="6.121">little now to summarize it to summarize</text>
  <text start="505.789" dur="5.22">the thesis United income argues that</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="4.32">retirees become more conservative as</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="4.681">they grow older which causes them to</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.469">save more and allocate less to equities</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="4.349">which is of course a somewhat</text>
  <text start="517.669" dur="4.86">self-serving collusion but let&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="520.039" dur="5.851">mind that the only problem with the</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="4.981">theory is that intentional or otherwise</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s based on a complete</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="6.96">misrepresentation of the data now when</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="6.21">we look at this they&amp;#39;re basing this off</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="4.97">the mean net wealth as evidence the</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="5.19">retirees are hoarding too much cash</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="5.709">unfortunately when combined with the</text>
  <text start="542.39" dur="7.11">fact that mean net wealth median net</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="6.301">wealth is actually shrinking it&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="4.589">to deduce that while the majority of</text>
  <text start="551.45" dur="4.77">American retirees are actually spending</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="4.471">their retirement income there is a group</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="4.2">of super wealthy old folks who simply</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t spend enough money to offset</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="4.65">annual investment income growth which</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="4.799">speaks more to the growing wealth gap</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="6.329">than to some economic figure that is</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="6.421">causing retirees to hoard cash so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.399" dur="5.551">not too difficult to understand why the</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="5.459">year on your spending trends collapse as</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="4.56">all folks get older the most wealth of</text>
  <text start="579.529" dur="5.701">retirees can only find so many ways to</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="5.37">burn their massive nest eggs now the</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="3.12">other end of the spectrum where you have</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.919">the middle class which is dying</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="5.129">and the lower-income well because of</text>
  <text start="591.799" dur="4.171">inflation because of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.479" dur="4.71">receiving now they barely have enough to</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="4.199">survive every single day and if you</text>
  <text start="598.189" dur="5.04">notice most of these individuals are</text>
  <text start="600.169" dur="5.82">getting part-time jobs to make up the</text>
  <text start="603.229" dur="5.4">difference so it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.989" dur="7.32">not spending money the money is just not</text>
  <text start="608.629" dur="5.79">out there and the 1% or the above 1% the</text>
  <text start="613.309" dur="4.53">point 5 percent</text>
  <text start="614.419" dur="4.92">guess what they just can&amp;#39;t make up the</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="3.69">difference for the rest of the</text>
  <text start="619.339" dur="7.29">population this has been the problem</text>
  <text start="621.529" dur="8.01">since the beginning where the point 5%</text>
  <text start="626.629" dur="5.88">the 1% they have all the wealth and</text>
  <text start="629.539" dur="5.27">everyone else they&amp;#39;re just getting by</text>
  <text start="632.509" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re living paycheck to paycheck</text>
  <text start="634.809" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re not getting cost of living</text>
  <text start="637.16" dur="5.539">raises many people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="639.559" dur="6.75">and their whole entire theory is</text>
  <text start="642.699" dur="6.04">completely down the drain it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="646.309" dur="6.421">even make sense they&amp;#39;re just looking for</text>
  <text start="648.739" dur="7.08">any type of explanation of why money is</text>
  <text start="652.73" dur="5.279">not coming back into the system and we</text>
  <text start="655.819" dur="4.77">know why it isn&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s all been</text>
  <text start="658.009" dur="4.711">filtered to the top but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="6.3">to tell anyone that because then they</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="6.269">would be to blame we also see that the</text>
  <text start="666.889" dur="5.15">US government they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="668.989" dur="5.55">well we&amp;#39;ve been calculating GDP</text>
  <text start="672.039" dur="4.15">incorrectly and when we look at our</text>
  <text start="674.539" dur="4.59">numbers and we go back in time we can</text>
  <text start="676.189" dur="4.74">see that yeah the GDP numbers should be</text>
  <text start="679.129" dur="4.05">a lot higher than they really are so</text>
  <text start="680.929" dur="4.77">they went back in time and they said</text>
  <text start="683.179" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re not accounting for inflation and</text>
  <text start="685.699" dur="4.26">technology and health care cost because</text>
  <text start="688.22" dur="4.889">these are rapidly changing things and</text>
  <text start="689.959" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re going to redo the GDP and when</text>
  <text start="693.109" dur="6.14">they did it to their surprise GDP was</text>
  <text start="696.289" dur="5.1">only about point four percent higher and</text>
  <text start="699.249" dur="4">what they were trying to do is they were</text>
  <text start="701.389" dur="4.68">trying to read manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="703.249" dur="5.9">remember they already went back to 1929</text>
  <text start="706.069" dur="5.31">added in research and development and</text>
  <text start="709.149" dur="6.701">recalculated GDP all the way to the</text>
  <text start="711.379" dur="7.98">present time they also include Obamacare</text>
  <text start="715.85" dur="5.729">which turns into individuals spending</text>
  <text start="719.359" dur="3.361">money into the economy which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="721.579" dur="2.551">really not</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re really not getting anything out</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="5.58">of this they were spending this money</text>
  <text start="726.29" dur="6.18">anyhow and they include this in retail</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="5.37">spending which is 70 percent of the GDP</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="5.19">and this is how they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="735.08" dur="4.2">keep GDP up now since a lot of people</text>
  <text start="737.66" dur="4.23">aren&amp;#39;t taking Obama care we can see that</text>
  <text start="739.28" dur="5.07">GDP is decreasing declining especially</text>
  <text start="741.89" dur="3.99">with less manufacturing less exports and</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="3.36">everything else everything&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="745.88" dur="3.27">fall apart and they&amp;#39;re trying to Rima</text>
  <text start="747.71" dur="4.23">nip yyl ate the numbers to make it seem</text>
  <text start="749.15" dur="5.64">like this is the reason and it just</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="7.56">didn&amp;#39;t work what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="754.79" dur="7.65">is that the entire system is collapsing</text>
  <text start="759.5" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re running out of excuses of why it</text>
  <text start="762.44" dur="6.21">is collapsing and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="764.98" dur="5.77">figure out some way to explain this now</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="4.26">remember they&amp;#39;re bringing down the</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="4.32">system the same time Trump is bringing</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="4.23">down the system the problem is the</text>
  <text start="775.07" dur="4.35">system is collapsing very very quickly</text>
  <text start="777.14" dur="4.65">right now and they need to control this</text>
  <text start="779.42" dur="4.35">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the central banks</text>
  <text start="781.79" dur="5.43">the deep state because if they lose</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="6.57">control of it they can&amp;#39;t control the</text>
  <text start="787.22" dur="5.37">narrative of what has happened if they</text>
  <text start="790.34" dur="4.92">lose the narrative of the story they</text>
  <text start="792.59" dur="4.47">will be blamed all fingers will be</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="3.54">pointing at them because what are they</text>
  <text start="797.06" dur="3.86">been telling us for the last eight nine</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="4.77">years the economy has recovered</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="5.38">everything is fine Obama handed off the</text>
  <text start="803.57" dur="5.04">economy to trump and it was absolutely</text>
  <text start="806.3" dur="4.05">fantastic you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me that</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="3.57">Trump in four months destroyed the</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="4.11">economy with doing absolutely nothing to</text>
  <text start="812.18" dur="5.1">the economy that is absolutely</text>
  <text start="814.46" dur="5.7">ridiculous and they realize he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="5.31">been in office long enough to blame it</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="5.52">on him they need more time and if the</text>
  <text start="822.59" dur="5.07">economy comes down too soon well this is</text>
  <text start="825.68" dur="4.38">a problem for them actually Bill Blaine</text>
  <text start="827.66" dur="5.04">is out there and he says while talking</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="5.73">to accounts I was struck by a sense of</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="5.94">resignation stock seemed determined to</text>
  <text start="835.79" dur="4.92">go stratospheric despite the fact that</text>
  <text start="838.64" dur="5.22">many people think a correction reset is</text>
  <text start="840.71" dur="4.95">coming for instance he said I told stock</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="5.22">market gains are due to passive</text>
  <text start="845.66" dur="6.03">investments like indices and etf rather</text>
  <text start="849.08" dur="5.7">than active management and tight yields</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="4.74">are unsustainable as when central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.78" dur="3.42">normalized interest rates</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;m higher but the bottom line is</text>
  <text start="858.2" dur="4.98">financial asset prices continue to rise</text>
  <text start="860.51" dur="4.35">despite our disbelief should you buy</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="4.71">into the story at this stage of the game</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="5.58">the rule remains don&amp;#39;t join the last 5%</text>
  <text start="867.89" dur="7.009">of a rally just so you can catch the</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="7.589">first 25% of the subsequent crash and</text>
  <text start="874.899" dur="5.141">what we are seeing at this point is</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="3.241">everyone&amp;#39;s scratching their heads they</text>
  <text start="880.04" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t understand why the market is</text>
  <text start="881.27" dur="3.6">continually rising because when you look</text>
  <text start="883.7" dur="2.639">at what&amp;#39;s been going on in the economy</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="3.63">look at the earnings you look at</text>
  <text start="886.339" dur="4.231">everything you can see that things are</text>
  <text start="888.5" dur="5.399">rapidly falling apart but the stock</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="5.34">market except for today has continually</text>
  <text start="893.899" dur="6.151">been moving up and up and up the S&amp;amp;P 500</text>
  <text start="895.91" dur="6.239">moving up the Nasdaq moving up something</text>
  <text start="900.05" dur="5.34">is wrong what we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern in</text>
  <text start="902.149" dur="6.271">the past this is nothing new the</text>
  <text start="905.39" dur="5.34">takeaway from all of this is that the</text>
  <text start="908.42" dur="5.49">system is collapsing and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="5.79">worse and it&amp;#39;s declining faster and</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="3.869">faster and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="916.52" dur="3.24">getting prepared we&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="917.779" dur="3.571">everyone you need to get ready and</text>
  <text start="919.76" dur="3.78">people are asking you know what do I</text>
  <text start="921.35" dur="3.679">need to do well think about it and I</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="4.29">discussed this many many times before</text>
  <text start="925.029" dur="4.391">get your food in place get your water in</text>
  <text start="927.83" dur="4.32">place get your medical supplies in place</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="5.85">get whatever you need that you would use</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="3.48">on a daily basis why why do you need</text>
  <text start="935.27" dur="3.24">this</text>
  <text start="935.63" dur="5.19">well when the dollar ceases to be it</text>
  <text start="938.51" dur="5.16">ceases to be the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="940.82" dur="4.17">world what happens when all those</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="2.55">dollars come flowing back to United</text>
  <text start="944.99" dur="3.48">States and eventually we will see</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="4.44">inflation the central bank will not be</text>
  <text start="948.47" dur="5.79">able to control this and what that means</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="5.31">is that it&amp;#39;s going to cost a lot more to</text>
  <text start="954.26" dur="4.47">get these supplies that&amp;#39;s why you need</text>
  <text start="955.97" dur="4.32">the food the medical supplies toiletries</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="3.03">water and those type of things because</text>
  <text start="960.29" dur="3.33">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen people</text>
  <text start="961.76" dur="3.54">can run to the store because prices are</text>
  <text start="963.62" dur="3.209">going to be running they actually the</text>
  <text start="965.3" dur="4.08">dollars going to be devaluing so quickly</text>
  <text start="966.829" dur="7.111">that prices are going to go up very very</text>
  <text start="969.38" dur="6.269">high the other reason is that credit is</text>
  <text start="973.94" dur="4.92">going to freeze up during this period of</text>
  <text start="975.649" dur="5.19">time just like we saw it in 2008 things</text>
  <text start="978.86" dur="4.14">will not loan they will not give missus</text>
  <text start="980.839" dur="6">loan most of these businesses run on</text>
  <text start="983" dur="6.27">credit and trucking rail traffic all</text>
  <text start="986.839" dur="2.961">this is going to stop so supplies to</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="2.84">stores</text>
  <text start="989.8" dur="5.94">are going to stop and this is going to</text>
  <text start="992.11" dur="5.82">be an additional problem on top of the</text>
  <text start="995.74" dur="4.26">inflation this is why you need to have</text>
  <text start="997.93" dur="4.26">those supplies you need to have the cash</text>
  <text start="1000" dur="4.83">on hand because in the beginning of a</text>
  <text start="1002.19" dur="5.13">collapse scenario you will use the paper</text>
  <text start="1004.83" dur="6.36">money even though it&amp;#39;s devaluing people</text>
  <text start="1007.32" dur="6.57">know what that is next once people</text>
  <text start="1011.19" dur="5.67">decide you know what this paper money is</text>
  <text start="1013.89" dur="3.54">absolutely worthless I&amp;#39;m not accepting</text>
  <text start="1016.86" dur="4.039">it anymore</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="6.45">they will take products food water</text>
  <text start="1020.899" dur="5.41">toiletries medicine anything that you</text>
  <text start="1023.88" dur="4.62">have to trade for something else because</text>
  <text start="1026.309" dur="4.26">they all see value in that because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1028.5" dur="5.069">very hard to get those supplies yes</text>
  <text start="1030.569" dur="6.181">there&amp;#39;ll be a black market eventually</text>
  <text start="1033.569" dur="7.5">what will happen is as time moves on</text>
  <text start="1036.75" dur="7.079">people might accept gold and silver most</text>
  <text start="1041.069" dur="6.811">likely silver depending on how things</text>
  <text start="1043.829" dur="5.551">work out I would suggest holding on to</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="4.11">your gold and silver because that is</text>
  <text start="1049.38" dur="6.03">your insurance policy of if you have</text>
  <text start="1051.99" dur="5.28">Bitcoin hold on to that because the</text>
  <text start="1055.41" dur="3.6">dollar will no longer cease to exist</text>
  <text start="1057.27" dur="4.17">when the new currency comes online</text>
  <text start="1059.01" dur="4.47">whatever it might be maybe it will be</text>
  <text start="1061.44" dur="5.369">Bitcoin maybe it will be a currency that</text>
  <text start="1063.48" dur="7.26">is backed in gold or silver well you</text>
  <text start="1066.809" dur="6.12">have that even if it isn&amp;#39;t well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1070.74" dur="4.319">going to re price everything reprice</text>
  <text start="1072.929" dur="5.611">everything and the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1075.059" dur="6.241">Bitcoin that is your insurance policy</text>
  <text start="1078.54" dur="4.32">you will also need a weapon to protect</text>
  <text start="1081.3" dur="2.73">yourself and I&amp;#39;m not saying that your</text>
  <text start="1082.86" dur="3.39">neighbors are going to come along get</text>
  <text start="1084.03" dur="3.87">you but there will be individuals</text>
  <text start="1086.25" dur="3.99">especially if you live close to cities</text>
  <text start="1087.9" dur="5.779">that will be roaming the streets looking</text>
  <text start="1090.24" dur="6.15">for supplies many people have put the</text>
  <text start="1093.679" dur="5.291">collapse at different timeframes six</text>
  <text start="1096.39" dur="5.94">months one year two years you need to be</text>
  <text start="1098.97" dur="6.18">prepared for this so you can see the</text>
  <text start="1102.33" dur="6.18">scenario that we&amp;#39;re looking at is going</text>
  <text start="1105.15" dur="4.98">to be a complete disaster and no matter</text>
  <text start="1108.51" dur="3.69">which way we look at it if the central</text>
  <text start="1110.13" dur="4.62">bank brings it down if Trump brings it</text>
  <text start="1112.2" dur="5.01">down it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because the</text>
