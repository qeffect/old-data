  <text start="33.76" dur="3.93">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.02" dur="5.16">episode 786 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="37.69" dur="4.5">october 8th 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="40.18" dur="4.47">episode is US government financial</text>
  <text start="42.19" dur="5.43">numbers are manipulated to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="44.65" dur="4.53">in this illusion of a recovery let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.62" dur="4.65">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.18" dur="6.15">financial news now we have been seeing</text>
  <text start="52.27" dur="5.16">the economy collapse right in front of</text>
  <text start="55.33" dur="4.95">our eyes I mean we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="57.43" dur="4.53">economic indicators we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="60.28" dur="4.05">through what the government throws at us</text>
  <text start="61.96" dur="4.65">of course they manipulate a lot of their</text>
  <text start="64.33" dur="6.78">data to make us think that everything is</text>
  <text start="66.61" dur="8.149">fine and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is that</text>
  <text start="71.11" dur="7.19">they are continually manipulating these</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="7.901">numbers like unemployment GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="78.3" dur="6.099">the banks are solvent the stock market</text>
  <text start="82.66" dur="4.02">is really doing well precious metals</text>
  <text start="84.399" dur="3.72">aren&amp;#39;t worth anything and they are</text>
  <text start="86.68" dur="3.42">continually doing this and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.119" dur="3.571">finding out is that they just don&amp;#39;t lie</text>
  <text start="90.1" dur="3.75">about what&amp;#39;s happening across the world</text>
  <text start="91.69" dur="5.07">they lie about what is actually</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="6.449">happening here in America and that is</text>
  <text start="96.76" dur="6">the economy is collapsing and they want</text>
  <text start="100.299" dur="5.341">us to believe that we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="102.76" dur="5.609">fantastic recovery and everything is</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="4.799">absolutely fine the west of the world is</text>
  <text start="108.369" dur="4.891">having the problem but not here in the</text>
  <text start="110.439" dur="4.711">United States and every time we look at</text>
  <text start="113.26" dur="6.39">this information that they throw at us</text>
  <text start="115.15" dur="7.399">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and when we look</text>
  <text start="119.65" dur="5.039">at these new initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="8.741">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;ve tumbled back</text>
  <text start="124.689" dur="9.36">to 42 year lows and we have to think how</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="5.28">could this possibly be that means that</text>
  <text start="134.049" dur="6.211">no one is getting laid off that means no</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="8.37">one is applying for these unemployment</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="7.229">claims and everything is fine the job</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="4.519">market is perfect but we have to</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="5.011">remember and I&amp;#39;ve said this many times</text>
  <text start="149.459" dur="4.961">they remove that department that counts</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="3.36">layoffs back in 2013 of course they said</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="3.629">its budget cuts but they kept the golf</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="4.439">courses the restaurants the limousines</text>
  <text start="158.049" dur="6.211">that bring them to different places the</text>
  <text start="160.299" dur="6.091">payment for hotels the payment for air</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="4.199">that bring them certain places but the</text>
  <text start="166.39" dur="5.67">office that counts those people losing</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="6.06">their jobs that office had a go which is</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="5.039">strange in itself so we have to rely on</text>
  <text start="174.519" dur="6.3">private companies like like challenger</text>
  <text start="177.099" dur="8.931">gray &amp;amp; christmas and they&amp;#39;ve come out</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="9.06">with their numbers and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="6.179">huge layoffs now the government is</text>
  <text start="189.879" dur="7.621">telling us that the initial claims drop</text>
  <text start="192.209" dur="6.941">13,000 this week to 263,000 and this is</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="5.43">bringing us back to nineteen seventy</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.27">three levels but when we look at what</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="4.979">has been going on and let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="7.03">June of 2014 at the number of layoffs</text>
  <text start="207.909" dur="6.631">and we&amp;#39;re gonna go forward here we see</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="8.72">in June we had about 31,000 July was</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="9.36">about 46 August 40 September 30 octobre</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="6.219">51,000 this is October of 2014 and we</text>
  <text start="223.9" dur="4.709">see this all the way up until this</text>
  <text start="226.389" dur="5.46">September and some of the months or</text>
  <text start="228.609" dur="5.49">50,000 some are as low as 30,000 and</text>
  <text start="231.849" dur="5.07">then we had a big jump in July of about</text>
  <text start="234.099" dur="5.241">a hundred and five thousand jobs this</text>
  <text start="236.919" dur="6.361">month in September we&amp;#39;re at 50,000</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="10.829">58,000 877 but when we add all this up</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="10.28">from jun 2014 to September of 2015 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.169" dur="7.391">750,000 jobs we are on track right now</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="9.57">to hit about a million people who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="8.579">been laid off so what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="7.06">where we&amp;#39;re seeing the government is</text>
  <text start="266.139" dur="7.321">telling us that nobody is applying for</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.949">unemployment now i&amp;#39;m going to use common</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.88">sense here and say this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="275.139" dur="6.931">ridiculous I mean let&amp;#39;s look at this for</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="9.259">a second the third quarter end with a</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="9.629">surge in job cuts they cut about 58,000</text>
  <text start="288.599" dur="5.38">877 in September which is a forty three</text>
  <text start="291.699" dur="5.28">percent increase from the previous month</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="4.081">and this is coming from challenger gray</text>
  <text start="296.979" dur="4.621">&amp;amp; christmas because the</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="6.78">doesn&amp;#39;t have a reporting office so the</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="6.63">September total was the third largest of</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="6.75">the year behind July which was 105 which</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="6.15">we just mentioned it was ninety-three</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="7.61">percent higher than the 30,000 plan</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="9.35">layoffs the same month a year ago so</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="7.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing job cuts increase</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="8.11">dramatically and we&amp;#39;re seeing initial</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="7.89">jobless claims decrease dramatically so</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="5.79">who&amp;#39;s lying here is it the government or</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="5.339">this private company which they really</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="4.17">have nothing to gain from this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="3.571">just reporting these numbers what does</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="4.679">the government have to gain well the</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="5.16">Obama administration shows that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="346.479" dur="5.041">an economic recovery by manipulating</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="4.769">these numbers that&amp;#39;s the motive right</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.59">here and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="8.301">seeing I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="11.76">second we&amp;#39;ve had almost a million jobs</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="9.4">removed from the country and no one is</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="8.25">going to the unemployment office we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="7.26">at 42 or 43 year lows it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="5.19">make sense just like everything else</text>
  <text start="378.85" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re throwing at us it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="6.78">sense and this shows us once again the</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="5.16">government is lying to its own people</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="3.99">and the last time I look in the</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="3.95">Constitution it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="4.92">about the government lying to the people</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="7.39">it says the government should be working</text>
  <text start="397" dur="7.02">for the people but we see the government</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="6.72">is on a different track than the people</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="8.94">of the United States we see student</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="8.52">homelessness this has doubled before</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="4.92">since before the recession the number of</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="5.34">homeless students in the country</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="8.64">classrooms has more than doubled and we</text>
  <text start="421.66" dur="7.95">are we went from in 2006 we went from</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="5.169">about point six million students who are</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="8.649">homeless and as</text>
  <text start="431.689" dur="11.61">of 2014 right now we&amp;#39;re at 1.3 million</text>
  <text start="438.259" dur="7.8">students who are homeless so what is</text>
  <text start="443.299" dur="5.97">this telling us this is saying that the</text>
  <text start="446.059" dur="5.34">economy right now as we go along in this</text>
  <text start="449.269" dur="8.7">recovery which there is no recovery it</text>
  <text start="451.399" dur="8.7">is getting a lot worse when we look at</text>
  <text start="457.969" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s really going on out in the real</text>
  <text start="460.099" dur="4.05">world compared with to what the</text>
  <text start="462.049" dur="5.01">government is telling us we see a</text>
  <text start="464.149" dur="5.461">completely different picture and we know</text>
  <text start="467.059" dur="4.801">by looking at all this by looking at the</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="4.889">real information and we know the real</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="5.669">information tells us that unemployment</text>
  <text start="474.499" dur="6.27">is nowhere near 5.1 percent it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.529" dur="6.42">completely impossible I mean if we just</text>
  <text start="480.769" dur="5.281">do the calculation with the UH that were</text>
  <text start="483.949" dur="6.45">laid off and the people who are getting</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="7.709">hired and if we remove the manipulation</text>
  <text start="490.399" dur="4.83">of those people who are getting</text>
  <text start="493.759" dur="4.23">part-time jobs who are counted as</text>
  <text start="495.229" dur="4.74">full-time jobs we see a very different</text>
  <text start="497.989" dur="6.24">story we see the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="499.969" dur="8.28">closer to thirty percent now if we use</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="6.84">that number that makes sense now because</text>
  <text start="508.249" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re seeing retail contract we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.069" dur="8.16">seeing more and more people being laid</text>
  <text start="512.569" dur="8.87">off we see spending is slowing we see</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="6.05">factory orders and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="521.439" dur="8.25">declining we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="8.41">falling we see housing sales are</text>
  <text start="529.689" dur="7.87">non-existent to the American everyday</text>
  <text start="533.689" dur="6.111">person the only reason the houses are</text>
  <text start="537.559" dur="4.981">being sold it&amp;#39;s because foreigners</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="6.009">investment companies hedge funds are</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="6.57">coming in with cash to purchase these</text>
  <text start="545.809" dur="8.88">homes if you strip them out the housing</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="9.3">market is dead the bank&amp;#39;s kept houses</text>
  <text start="554.689" dur="7.681">off the market on purpose to increase</text>
  <text start="558.41" dur="7.21">the prices of homes and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="5.469">getting word from a US retail</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="7.5">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this holiday</text>
  <text start="567.839" dur="6.571">season is going to be awful now of</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="4.32">course they say it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="5.25">slower growth this holiday season have</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="7.02">what they really mean it&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="7.29">to be terrible the NRF said holiday</text>
  <text start="584.46" dur="4.5">sales will account for nineteen percent</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.389">of the industry&amp;#39;s three point two</text>
  <text start="588.96" dur="6.99">trillion and annual sales many retailers</text>
  <text start="592.339" dur="6.611">earn an outsize portion of their profits</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="5.48">during this holiday season so if they</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t hit their mark this holiday season</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="9.13">we are going to see a mass number of</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="6.57">stores closing other groups have also</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="5.49">forecast slower growth this holiday</text>
  <text start="612.24" dur="5.22">season AlixPartners their forecast is</text>
  <text start="616.05" dur="3.479">about two point eight percent growth</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="6.06">this holiday season compared to last</text>
  <text start="619.529" dur="7.141">year which was 4.4% previous to that it</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="5.39">was close to six then eight so the</text>
  <text start="626.67" dur="6.12">unemployment rate is coming down and</text>
  <text start="628.91" dur="7.99">we&amp;#39;re seeing the growth of sales during</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="6.63">the holiday seasons drop each year using</text>
  <text start="636.9" dur="4.95">common sense once again this tells us</text>
  <text start="639.42" dur="5.13">that yes unemployment is closer to the</text>
  <text start="641.85" dur="5.22">thirty percent mark and not the 5.1</text>
  <text start="644.55" dur="5.039">percent because this is something that</text>
  <text start="647.07" dur="4.68">you would see if more and more people</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="5.94">are unemployed more and more people have</text>
  <text start="651.75" dur="7.68">part-time jobs more import don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="655.529" dur="7.461">discretionary funds I mean the</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="6.75">government is just taking everything and</text>
  <text start="662.99" dur="6.37">lying about it now there was another</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="5.94">survey done which shows that two out of</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="7.22">three Americans have one thousand</text>
  <text start="672.12" dur="4.46">dollars or less in their savings account</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="8.02">so okay so now we have this included in</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="7.26">our entire view of what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="6.6">on people don&amp;#39;t even have money in their</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="6.18">savings account most of their credit</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="4.62">cards are topped off they have no room</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="3.83">left because they&amp;#39;ve been using it to</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="2.33">survive</text>
  <text start="698.579" dur="6.51">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that these people</text>
  <text start="703.069" dur="6.43">they&amp;#39;re not going to go out and spend</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="6.09">during this holiday season whatever</text>
  <text start="709.499" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re going to do is that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="711.179" dur="7.681">trying to get by every single day and we</text>
  <text start="716.009" dur="5.091">see that this one in five is really</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="4.939">sixty-two percent of Americans that</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="5.609">don&amp;#39;t have a thousand in their savings a</text>
  <text start="723.799" dur="5.41">lot of them don&amp;#39;t have any cash reserves</text>
  <text start="726.709" dur="8.021">to cover any type of an emergency that</text>
  <text start="729.209" dur="11.43">comes up and from all of this we see</text>
  <text start="734.73" dur="12">that this economy cannot recover this</text>
  <text start="740.639" dur="9.24">way we are in a slow grind down into a</text>
  <text start="746.73" dur="6.719">collapse for all intents purposes we</text>
  <text start="749.879" dur="7.95">have collapsed we are in a depression</text>
  <text start="753.449" dur="6.271">and we have been in a very long time the</text>
  <text start="757.829" dur="4.711">government has been keeping everyone in</text>
  <text start="759.72" dur="5.13">an illusion but what&amp;#39;s happening now is</text>
  <text start="762.54" dur="6.389">we&amp;#39;re seeing cracks all over the place</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="10.169">we&amp;#39;re seeing banks companies starting to</text>
  <text start="768.929" dur="7.74">really feel this depression and a lot of</text>
  <text start="775.019" dur="2.88">these retailers a lot of these</text>
  <text start="776.669" dur="2.88">corporations that are laying off</text>
  <text start="777.899" dur="3.66">thousands upon thousands of people</text>

  <text start="839.369" dur="5.82">these central bankers have left to keep</text>
  <text start="841.889" dur="8.34">this illusion alive I mean we are</text>
  <text start="845.189" dur="8.34">definitely seeing signs of a huge crisis</text>
  <text start="850.229" dur="6.81">headed our way I mean we have Glencore</text>
  <text start="853.529" dur="8.61">we have Deutsche Bank we have UBS credit</text>
  <text start="857.039" dur="8.16">Swiss all on the verge of basically</text>
  <text start="862.139" dur="5.61">doing a Lehman now we don&amp;#39;t know which</text>
  <text start="865.199" dur="6.03">of these corporations this is going to</text>
  <text start="867.749" dur="6.66">happen to but we are right at the cusp</text>
  <text start="871.229" dur="4.77">of it happening and something very</text>
  <text start="874.409" dur="4.5">strange occurred in the banking system</text>
  <text start="875.999" dur="5.73">in September that required a massive</text>
  <text start="878.909" dur="4.92">reverse repo operation in order to force</text>
  <text start="881.729" dur="4.64">the largest ever Treasury collateral</text>
  <text start="883.829" dur="5.1">injection into the repo market</text>
  <text start="886.369" dur="4.36">ordinarily the Fed might engage in</text>
  <text start="888.929" dur="3.59">routine reverse repos as a means of</text>
  <text start="890.729" dur="4.62">managing the Fed Funds rate however</text>
  <text start="892.519" dur="5.23">there have been sudden spikes up in the</text>
  <text start="895.349" dur="6.47">amount of reverse repos that tend to</text>
  <text start="897.749" dur="6.84">correspond the some type of crisis and</text>
  <text start="901.819" dur="8.95">of course we saw it back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="904.589" dur="8.82">eight and just recently we saw a huge</text>
  <text start="910.769" dur="13.14">spike of about four hundred and five</text>
  <text start="913.409" dur="12.99">billion over two weeks and this is huge</text>
  <text start="923.909" dur="6.811">compared to what happened in 2008 where</text>
  <text start="926.399" dur="8.76">it was only about a hundred billion so</text>
  <text start="930.72" dur="6.119">something big just happened and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="935.159" dur="4.23">even more interesting is that the spike</text>
  <text start="936.839" dur="4.8">up in reverse repos occurred at the same</text>
  <text start="939.389" dur="4.8">time September 16th that the stock</text>
  <text start="941.639" dur="6.15">market embarked on an eight-day cliff</text>
  <text start="944.189" dur="6.81">dive with the sp500 falling six percent</text>
  <text start="947.789" dur="5.67">in that time period and this is also</text>
  <text start="950.999" dur="6.99">that the same time that Glencore stock</text>
  <text start="953.459" dur="6.39">and bonds crashed and we saw this</text>
  <text start="957.989" dur="4.56">happened back in two thousand eight but</text>
  <text start="959.849" dur="6.05">this time it was much much larger about</text>
  <text start="962.549" dur="3.35">four to five times larger</text>
  <text start="966.03" dur="6.03">and this should be this is red flashing</text>
  <text start="969.63" dur="8.25">lights all over the place that something</text>
  <text start="972.06" dur="7.98">huge is coming now China they are going</text>

  <text start="1055.3" dur="8.82">trading across the globe and they</text>
  <text start="1061.34" dur="5.73">definitely do not want this to occur and</text>
  <text start="1064.12" dur="6.07">we can see this by what is happening</text>
  <text start="1067.07" dur="8.57">around the world they are pushing and</text>
  <text start="1070.19" dur="8.88">provoking in every corner of the world</text>
  <text start="1075.64" dur="6.94">we understand that the TPP was signed by</text>
  <text start="1079.07" dur="4.98">12 different nations they left out China</text>
  <text start="1082.58" dur="4.77">they left out pretty much the BRIC</text>
  <text start="1084.05" dur="6.42">nations and the reason they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1087.35" dur="8.21">this is to remove China and the BRIC</text>
  <text start="1090.47" dur="7.89">nations from the trading platform and</text>
  <text start="1095.56" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to lock it in with all</text>
  <text start="1098.36" dur="4.62">the other countries</text>
  <text start="1099.71" dur="7.14">now of course China is out there trying</text>
  <text start="1102.98" dur="8.189">to create their own and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1106.85" dur="10.439">to divert trade to China and the other</text>
  <text start="1111.169" dur="8.341">BRIC nations and we know the TPP is done</text>
  <text start="1117.289" dur="5.091">in secret we know it&amp;#39;s not for the</text>
  <text start="1119.51" dur="5.57">people and there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1122.38" dur="6.909">sections that have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1125.08" dur="8.589">trade I mean one of the sections has to</text>
  <text start="1129.289" dur="7.911">do with internet censorship and this</text>
  <text start="1133.669" dur="8.851">will allow corporations to go after</text>
  <text start="1137.2" dur="8.02">different groups and it will allow them</text>
  <text start="1142.52" dur="4.74">to go after punitive damages against</text>
  <text start="1145.22" dur="4.62">groups like public advocacy groups</text>
  <text start="1147.26" dur="4.83">bloggers websites individual journalists</text>
  <text start="1149.84" dur="3.87">for exposing wrongdoing by among others</text>
  <text start="1152.09" dur="4.11">corporate polluters manufacturers of</text>
  <text start="1153.71" dur="4.939">unsafe items the genetically modified</text>
  <text start="1156.2" dur="6.15">food industry and even governments</text>
  <text start="1158.649" dur="5.321">critics of the TPP argue because the</text>
  <text start="1162.35" dur="3.179">agreement is a huge giveaway of</text>
  <text start="1163.97" dur="3.959">corporations at the expense of the</text>
  <text start="1165.529" dur="5.25">general public freedom of expression and</text>
  <text start="1167.929" dur="8.461">speech on the internet will suffer so</text>
  <text start="1170.779" dur="7.921">those people who are talking about the</text>
  <text start="1176.39" dur="6.18">government and other corporations and</text>
  <text start="1178.7" dur="6.859">don&amp;#39;t agree with their views they could</text>
  <text start="1182.57" dur="9.68">basically stopped them on the internet</text>
  <text start="1185.559" dur="10.031">and go after them for speaking your mind</text>
  <text start="1192.25" dur="5.289">there is also a clear danger that the</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="3.93">entertainment industry and their</text>
  <text start="1197.539" dur="4.38">intellectual property lawyers will try</text>
  <text start="1199.52" dur="5.67">to use the TPP to enact be stopped</text>
  <text start="1201.919" dur="5.791">Online Privacy Act which is SOPA which</text>
  <text start="1205.19" dur="7.56">did not pass Congress but if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1207.71" dur="7.469">introduced in the TPP guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1212.75" dur="4.59">not going to see it it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1215.179" dur="7.071">buried and it&amp;#39;s going to go right</text>
  <text start="1217.34" dur="7.35">through if Congress signs off on it and</text>
  <text start="1222.25" dur="5.26">we mentioned about the copyright laws</text>
  <text start="1224.69" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s another problem so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1227.51" dur="4.83">trying to do and I mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="1229.25" dur="4.17">is the government has the ability to</text>
  <text start="1232.34" dur="3.3">create</text>
  <text start="1233.42" dur="5.81">not the government the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="1235.64" dur="8.61">bankers have the ability to create money</text>
  <text start="1239.23" dur="7.87">they control the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="1244.25" dur="7.2">last thing they need to do is to control</text>
  <text start="1247.1" dur="6.96">the internet and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1251.45" dur="5.19">trying to do and of course they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1254.06" dur="4.14">it in a way that nobody knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1256.64" dur="3.66">really going on because this whole</text>
  <text start="1258.2" dur="4.29">thing&amp;#39;s kept a secret the people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1260.3" dur="5.91">know what&amp;#39;s going on and I&amp;#39;m sure if we</text>
  <text start="1262.49" dur="6.6">were able to read the TPP we would find</text>
  <text start="1266.21" dur="4.92">so many different sections that the</text>
  <text start="1269.09" dur="3.62">people would not agree with that this</text>
  <text start="1271.13" dur="4.62">would never be passed and hopefully</text>
  <text start="1272.71" dur="5.38">Congress does the right thing but at</text>
  <text start="1275.75" dur="4.23">this point in time I really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1278.09" dur="5.76">they will look what they did with</text>
  <text start="1279.98" dur="8.19">Obamacare they went ahead they passed it</text>
  <text start="1283.85" dur="6">and none of them even read it what do</text>
  <text start="1288.17" dur="4.32">you think is going to happen with the</text>
  <text start="1289.85" dur="4.95">TPP they&amp;#39;re not going to read it and</text>
  <text start="1292.49" dur="5.16">most likely they&amp;#39;ll just let it go right</text>
  <text start="1294.8" dur="4.59">through because why they&amp;#39;re not working</text>
  <text start="1297.65" dur="3.51">for the people they&amp;#39;re working for</text>
  <text start="1299.39" dur="4.02">themselves if they were working for the</text>
