  <text start="42.43" dur="5.91">meant to provoke china further let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="45.58" dur="8.3">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="48.34" dur="9.62">geopolitical news now DHS was created as</text>
  <text start="53.88" dur="9.01">an extension of the executive branch to</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="7.57">then go out and control basically the</text>
  <text start="62.89" dur="5.34">police forces around the country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.53" dur="5.22">their own personal military because they</text>
  <text start="68.23" dur="4.82">cannot have the armed forces on US soil</text>
  <text start="70.75" dur="4.83">so they had to create some type of</text>
  <text start="73.05" dur="5.05">system where they have control and we</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="7.11">see DHS right now giving military</text>
  <text start="78.1" dur="7.379">equipment to all the local police units</text>
  <text start="82.69" dur="6.3">around the country we understand that</text>
  <text start="85.479" dur="5.341">the president now is testing six</text>
  <text start="88.99" dur="6.39">different cities to federalize the</text>

  <text start="95.38" dur="5.01">has already started if you see something</text>
  <text start="97.329" dur="6">say something basically everyone spying</text>
  <text start="100.39" dur="4.439">on each other and now they&amp;#39;re taking it</text>
  <text start="103.329" dur="5.871">to the next level and you have to</text>
  <text start="104.829" dur="9.781">remember they do this at a young age</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="9.129">Common Core because they need to</text>
  <text start="114.61" dur="7.35">indoctrinate children the youth of</text>
  <text start="118.329" dur="5.79">America and brainwash them as they get</text>
  <text start="121.96" dur="4.019">older so they need to start at a very</text>
  <text start="124.119" dur="4.11">young age so they have common core they</text>
  <text start="125.979" dur="5.191">have many other type of programs that</text>
  <text start="128.229" dur="4.891">they&amp;#39;re using like the gun century</text>
  <text start="131.17" dur="5.45">program and now they have this new</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="6.12">program called Project safe campus and</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="4.57">basically what the HS is doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="5.16">almost like if you see something say</text>
  <text start="141.19" dur="8.64">something they want kids in the school</text>
  <text start="144.4" dur="10.83">to spy on other kids and they will give</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="8.57">them cash if they give the information</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="6.33">over to DHS now does it mean that</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.169">someone is doing something or something</text>
  <text start="161.56" dur="2.96">is actually happening now they just see</text>
  <text start="163.569" dur="5.011">something</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;re going to report it and DHS is</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="5.88">going to pay them in cash and we saw</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="5.94">this back in many other countries one</text>
  <text start="174.46" dur="4.74">being Germany where they did this with</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="4.56">the youth of America where they kept an</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="3.68">eye on everyone and it seems like</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re doing this to the entirety of</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="6.55">society right now where they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="185.2" dur="6.27">adults like in New York City where if</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="4.95">you see someone having a weapon report</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="4.77">them and they&amp;#39;ll be investigated and if</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="4.32">they have that weapon illegally you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="196.24" dur="4.29">get five hundred dollars and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="4.11">coming down to the level of our children</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="6.84">and we can see why this is happening</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="7.56">because they need the eyes and ears of</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="4.89">the people and the only way to get</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="4.26">people to do something is to give them a</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="4.86">reward and that is normally cash and</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="5.43">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now so</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="6.54">as we move into this collapse of the</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="9.99">economy and we become more of a</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="10.65">fascistic country we are now seeing the</text>
  <text start="230.05" dur="10.95">state the corporation&amp;#39;s all merge into</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="8.82">one and people spying on people and what</text>
  <text start="241" dur="8.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is just the</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="8.91">beginning this will accelerate as we</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="5.79">move further and further into 2016 and</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="6.419">the economy gets worse and they need to</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="5.97">provoke a war they realize the systems</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="6.481">breaking down society is breaking down</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="5.43">and they will try to control as much as</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="4.5">they possibly can as long as they</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="5.88">possibly can remember they never want to</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="5.4">give up our once they&amp;#39;re in power our</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="4.29">government employees they will not</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="3.77">easily give it up whatsoever they will</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="5.46">keep it and do whatever they have to to</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="6.76">keep the rest of the people from taking</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="6.27">it from them and they will continue to</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="4.859">spy on you they will look at your email</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="4.02">they will listen to your phone calls and</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="4.771">this will be expanded we are already</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.79">seeing it expanded they&amp;#39;re telling us at</text>
  <text start="295" dur="4.71">the NSA oh no where were</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="3.089">looking in on this we&amp;#39;re going to stop</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="4.59">the spine but all they did was switch it</text>
  <text start="301.389" dur="5.821">from government agencies over to the</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="3.989">corporations that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="3.47">and this is why everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="7.38">protect themselves continually use</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="8.35">devices software encryption to protect</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="7.021">yourself we cannot let them feel like</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s so easy to spy on us I mean they</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="4.879">are violating our rights but the only</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="5.85">way to back it up is to use encryption</text>
  <text start="327.569" dur="5.621">to make sure your searches are not known</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="5.069">by them you can use star page I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="3.719">to start page calm and you can use that</text>
  <text start="335.319" dur="3.961">search engine a lot of times you can use</text>

  <text start="469.06" dur="3.63">course we didn&amp;#39;t hear anything about</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="4.4">this in the United States because</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="5.49">whenever the United States does this</text>
  <text start="474.539" dur="5.35">they don&amp;#39;t report it when Russia does it</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="3.359">or China does it even though they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="751.06" dur="5.16">just sits by and they resupply the</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="4.8">Islamic state and other terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="7.02">and they give the Iraqis wrong</text>
  <text start="759.55" dur="6.539">coordinates to attack because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="763.24" dur="5.76">want their proxy forces being hit and</text>
  <text start="766.089" dur="7.591">they&amp;#39;re using Iraq as a staging area to</text>

  <text start="773.68" dur="6.389">just all falling apart right now now</text>

  <text start="783.31" dur="5.04">explaining that we need much more than</text>

  <text start="788.35" dur="6.33">we need boots on the ground and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="794.68" dur="5.76">more troops into Syria now of course the</text>
  <text start="797.98" dur="5.46">President of the United States has told</text>
  <text start="800.44" dur="5.759">us 16 times now there will be no boots</text>
  <text start="803.44" dur="5.699">on the ground and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="806.199" dur="4.801">the complete opposite what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="809.139" dur="5.521">seeing is mission creep what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="811" dur="7.019">seeing is a push for the authorization</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="9.15">for war and right now there are growing</text>
  <text start="818.019" dur="9.81">calls for the authorization of war vote</text>
  <text start="823.81" dur="6.149">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the problems in</text>
  <text start="827.829" dur="4.421">Syria are getting worse and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.959" dur="5.541">using the propaganda that Russia</text>
  <text start="832.25" dur="4.96">cannot destroy the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="3.87">actually losing ground which is all</text>
  <text start="837.21" dur="4.64">propaganda and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="5.19">their case in Congress right now and</text>
  <text start="841.85" dur="7.03">they&amp;#39;re trying to push the authorization</text>
  <text start="844.56" dur="5.94">of war through and we know this</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="4.67">authorization for war will allow the</text>
  <text start="850.5" dur="7.68">United States to go into Libya Yemen</text>
  <text start="853.55" dur="6.79">Lebanon or any other country that has</text>

  <text start="860.34" dur="5.55">al-shabaab or any terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="862.26" dur="5.76">and they will use this to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="4.62">and this is what they&amp;#39;re pushing right</text>
  <text start="868.02" dur="5.78">now now will they get traction to push</text>
  <text start="870.51" dur="5.85">this through Congress most likely not</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="5.77">Congress is not going to be moved by</text>
  <text start="876.36" dur="4.86">what Russia is doing in Syria the only</text>
  <text start="879.57" dur="3.29">way to get Congress to do something and</text>
  <text start="881.22" dur="5.64">the American people to do something is</text>
  <text start="882.86" dur="6.34">to have an event we already have</text>
  <text start="886.86" dur="4.29">legislation standing there and we know</text>
  <text start="889.2" dur="6.54">the US government when they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
  <text start="891.15" dur="7.62">into a corner they use events to push</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="4.26">the legislation through and we will see</text>
  <text start="898.77" dur="3.63">something like this and it&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="900" dur="4.62">false flag well they will do something</text>
  <text start="902.4" dur="3.81">here in the United States blame it on</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="3.29">the Islamic state even though we know</text>
  <text start="906.21" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s the proxy army of the United States</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="4.21">but most of the people still believe</text>
  <text start="910.11" dur="5.37">that the Islamic state is a terrorist</text>
  <text start="912.12" dur="5.73">organization coming after the American</text>
  <text start="915.48" dur="4.91">people which is actually the opposite</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="5.16">the United States controls the terrorist</text>
  <text start="920.39" dur="6.76">organization which is going after Assad</text>
  <text start="923.01" dur="8.31">and we can see they&amp;#39;re going to make a</text>
  <text start="927.15" dur="6.69">major major push to get this through and</text>
  <text start="931.32" dur="8.34">when it fails they will resort to an</text>
  <text start="933.84" dur="8.37">event now out in the UK Russia will be</text>
  <text start="939.66" dur="3.9">named as a top-tier potential threat</text>
  <text start="942.21" dur="4.23">when Prime Minister David Cameron</text>
  <text start="943.56" dur="8.52">announces the UK new national security</text>
  <text start="946.44" dur="7.56">strategy later in November right now the</text>
  <text start="952.08" dur="6.38">Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is</text>
  <text start="954" dur="9.96">suggesting Putin might use nukes on</text>
  <text start="958.46" dur="10.48">America but don&amp;#39;t worry us will def</text>
  <text start="963.96" dur="6.66">and their international order so</text>
  <text start="968.94" dur="4.73">basically they&amp;#39;re using the narrative</text>
  <text start="970.62" dur="6.48">and it revolves around two things a</text>
  <text start="973.67" dur="5.83">resurgent Russia and the rise of China</text>
  <text start="977.1" dur="5.49">and of course we have to know who our</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="5.01">enemy is going to be so they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="982.59" dur="5.31">the idea that Russia and China North</text>
  <text start="984.51" dur="8.85">Korea Iran Syria Brazil Argentina</text>
  <text start="987.9" dur="11.4">Venezuela maybe India will all be our</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="8.46">enemy on this upcoming war so it looks</text>
  <text start="999.3" dur="4.92">like right now that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1001.82" dur="6.33">bringing in more troops into Eastern</text>
  <text start="1004.22" dur="5.4">Europe and a US military strategist</text>
  <text start="1008.15" dur="4.71">believes the US and NATO would be</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="8.22">annihilated if there is any type of bulk</text>
  <text start="1012.86" dur="7.62">and battle with Russia so we have more</text>
  <text start="1017.84" dur="5.19">troops going into Eastern Europe we have</text>
  <text start="1020.48" dur="6.78">United States provoking China in the</text>
  <text start="1023.03" dur="7.53">South Pacific we have the push for</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="7.56">authorization for war we have boots</text>
  <text start="1030.56" dur="6.45">going on into Syria we have the f-15s in</text>
  <text start="1034.82" dur="7.019">Turkey that only have air-to-air</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="7.89">missiles this is all starting to fit</text>
  <text start="1041.839" dur="8.671">into a scenario where we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1044.9" dur="9.12">entering World War three and then we</text>
  <text start="1050.51" dur="6.75">have the down Russian plane now right</text>
  <text start="1054.02" dur="5.94">now the United States UK or saying they</text>
  <text start="1057.26" dur="4.74">have special Intel that says it&amp;#39;s a bomb</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="4.08">Russia is not finished with their</text>
  <text start="1062" dur="4.82">investigation they heard some type of</text>
  <text start="1064.04" dur="5.4">noise they don&amp;#39;t know what it is yet</text>
  <text start="1066.82" dur="4.75">they haven&amp;#39;t found any bomb residue on</text>
  <text start="1069.44" dur="5.61">the passengers but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1071.57" dur="7.47">investigating and then we find out that</text>
  <text start="1075.05" dur="9.69">the US and the UK received their Intel</text>
  <text start="1079.04" dur="10.32">from Israel before all this they had no</text>
  <text start="1084.74" dur="6.87">Intel so where did Israel get its Intel</text>
  <text start="1089.36" dur="5.52">that this was a bomb because we know</text>
  <text start="1091.61" dur="7.159">Rita cats puts up the videos for the</text>
  <text start="1094.88" dur="6.659">Islamic state she knows where to find</text>
  <text start="1098.769" dur="6.961">you know what I mean they create them</text>
  <text start="1101.539" dur="9.27">and all of a sudden Israel has the Intel</text>
  <text start="1105.73" dur="9.429">for this bombing and we know this is all</text>
  <text start="1110.809" dur="7.441">part of the same system and of course</text>
  <text start="1115.159" dur="7.38">this was if it was a bomb this was a</text>
  <text start="1118.25" dur="6.36">message to Russia we can get you and it</text>
  <text start="1122.539" dur="4.38">again there&amp;#39;s other agendas that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1124.61" dur="6.199">trying to scare the people of Russia</text>
  <text start="1126.919" dur="7.35">with terrorism it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="1130.809" dur="7.48">now the United States is also preparing</text>
  <text start="1134.269" dur="6.841">for a single weather event that could</text>
  <text start="1138.289" dur="5.01">cost two trillion in damage on October</text>
  <text start="1141.11" dur="3.779">29th the White House National Science</text>
  <text start="1143.299" dur="4.23">and Technology Council released a</text>
  <text start="1144.889" dur="4.65">strategic plan to prepare for an extreme</text>

  <text start="1149.539" dur="6.27">destroy satellite spacecraft and vital</text>

  <text start="1155.809" dur="7.201">looking to start this program and</text>
  <text start="1159.26" dur="6.899">they&amp;#39;re prepping for some type of space</text>
  <text start="1163.01" dur="9.87">EMP burst that&amp;#39;s basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1166.159" dur="12.541">saying and then we had a trident missile</text>
  <text start="1172.88" dur="7.47">launched from a submarine now was the US</text>
  <text start="1178.7" dur="5.52">government trying to send a message to</text>
  <text start="1180.35" dur="6.329">someone on Saturday night because if</text>
  <text start="1184.22" dur="3.66">they fired this during the day most of</text>
  <text start="1186.679" dur="2.941">the people probably would have seen it</text>
  <text start="1187.88" dur="5.13">because it was too bright out you</text>
  <text start="1189.62" dur="5.88">wouldn&amp;#39;t see the smoke plume or the fire</text>
  <text start="1193.01" dur="5.129">from the back of the rocket engine so</text>
  <text start="1195.5" dur="5.82">many people would have seated if they</text>
  <text start="1198.139" dur="6.451">fired at midnight or you know one or two</text>
  <text start="1201.32" dur="4.38">two o&amp;#39;clock in the morning most of the</text>
  <text start="1204.59" dur="4.23">people wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen it then so</text>
  <text start="1205.7" dur="9.03">they planned it perfectly to be fired at</text>
  <text start="1208.82" dur="8.579">night at prime time so the US military</text>
  <text start="1214.73" dur="5.669">they establish a no-fly zone west of Los</text>
  <text start="1217.399" dur="4.561">Angeles for a week and many people said</text>
  <text start="1220.399" dur="4.41">hmm that&amp;#39;s very interesting why are they</text>
  <text start="1221.96" dur="5.219">doing this well now we know why but</text>
  <text start="1224.809" dur="6.511">nobody expected the u.s. to fire a</text>
  <text start="1227.179" dur="6.721">trident to missile from the USS Kentucky</text>
  <text start="1231.32" dur="4.44">which was very close to the United</text>
  <text start="1233.9" dur="5.04">States so me so they make sure everyone</text>
  <text start="1235.76" dur="6.99">saw it people in Arizona and Nevada</text>
  <text start="1238.94" dur="5.67">actually saw it and the Navy right now</text>
  <text start="1242.75" dur="7.53">is assuring that this is perfectly</text>
  <text start="1244.61" dur="7.44">normal this is what we do but no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1250.28" dur="5.79">really buying this explanation because</text>
  <text start="1252.05" dur="6.81">why did they have to do this so close to</text>
  <text start="1256.07" dur="5.16">the coast they have the entire Pacific</text>
  <text start="1258.86" dur="4.89">Ocean to do this they didn&amp;#39;t need to do</text>
  <text start="1261.23" dur="4.2">this right here and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1263.75" dur="7.55">interesting because they&amp;#39;re firing this</text>
  <text start="1265.43" dur="9.95">off at the end of their drill called</text>
  <text start="1271.3" dur="8.79">Trident juncture and this was a huge</text>
  <text start="1275.38" dur="6.97">drill that NATO and the US were having</text>
  <text start="1280.09" dur="8.11">it&amp;#39;s one of the biggest drills in the</text>
  <text start="1282.35" dur="7.38">last 13 years so the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="1288.2" dur="3.9">US government was telling us that this</text>
  <text start="1289.73" dur="4.29">missile was unarmed but when it was</text>
  <text start="1292.1" dur="4.07">blasted off how did the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1294.02" dur="5.25">know this they didn&amp;#39;t they had no idea</text>
  <text start="1296.17" dur="7.12">nobody had any idea it could have been a</text>
  <text start="1299.27" dur="9.39">real launch for all we thought and this</text>
  <text start="1303.29" dur="8.79">was done on purpose this was to provoke</text>
  <text start="1308.66" dur="6.09">China because when you look at it it</text>
  <text start="1312.08" dur="7.29">flew from the coast of California to the</text>
