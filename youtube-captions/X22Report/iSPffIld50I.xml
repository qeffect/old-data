  <text start="53.219" dur="8.64">and I thought it was appropriate to use</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="5.941">this title because a lot of times when</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="5.131">we&amp;#39;re talking about the collapse and</text>
  <text start="64.23" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re talking about what&amp;#39;s going on you</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="5.519">know sometimes there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not much</text>

  <text start="72.509" dur="4.801">going on but there&amp;#39;s still signs</text>

  <text start="93.72" dur="5.429">it&amp;#39;s everywhere and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="96.719" dur="6.871">news and we look and we see what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="99.149" dur="7.531">on you can see this we need to heighten</text>

  <text start="106.68" dur="4.979">on and we&amp;#39;re going to look at some of</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.551">the different signs and different things</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="5.941">that are going on and you know take</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="6.36">these pieces put them into our puzzle</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="6.21">and as as we put more pieces the picture</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="4.74">gets clearer and clearer and you can see</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="6.33">what&amp;#39;s going on and even the mainstream</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="6.24">media on some shows that I see are even</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="6.239">talking about the stock market bubble</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="7.89">that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all artificial it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="136.379" dur="8.61">to pop what happens if</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="7.649">the the the bankers decide to shut down</text>
  <text start="144.989" dur="5.731">the banks here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="148.049" dur="7.19">take our might what would happen I mean</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="8.189">you you&amp;#39;re starting to hear a little bit</text>
  <text start="155.239" dur="7.241">because they&amp;#39;re starting to awaken a</text>
  <text start="158.909" dur="6.541">little bit and even if you remember all</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="6.78">human beings now when we talk about the</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="6.33">mainstream media these are still humans</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="5.789">they still have brains they still think</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="4.709">and when you&amp;#39;re bombarded by alternative</text>
  <text start="175.049" dur="4.44">medium they hear things from other</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="5.25">places they start to think a little bit</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="4.051">and sometimes it does come out because</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="4.14">if to remember they&amp;#39;re living in this</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="4.619">world just like we are they have their</text>
  <text start="185.879" dur="5.101">money in the bank just like everybody</text>
  <text start="188.159" dur="4.86">else there there&amp;#39;s really you know no</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="3.839">difference yeah they have a job and the</text>
  <text start="193.019" dur="3.661">reporting and they&amp;#39;re like robots and</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="4.32">they just you know they did they tell</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="6.149">you what&amp;#39;s going on but sometimes they</text>
  <text start="199.139" dur="6.151">slip and they really start to tell you</text>
  <text start="202.829" dur="6.151">what&amp;#39;s going on and I try to put those</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="8.129">type of videos I have another one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="7.8">going to put up there that I see and you</text>
  <text start="213.419" dur="6.9">could see it&amp;#39;s all starting to to come</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="6.09">about maybe not in a huge way where</text>
  <text start="220.319" dur="5.13">everyone wanted to be where you know the</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="4.829">lights go out tomorrow or there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="225.449" dur="4.111">type of you know you wake up in the</text>
  <text start="227.699" dur="4.081">stock market&amp;#39;s going from fourteen</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="4.739">thousand twelve thousand ten thousand</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="6.09">nine that you know yeah that&amp;#39;d be great</text>
  <text start="234.299" dur="5.881">you know in a movie but when it does</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="5.729">happen it will happen but there are</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="6.33">other signs that we can see and we can</text>
  <text start="243.599" dur="5.76">see how things are forming so let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="7.619">a look I mean we talked about the ammo</text>
  <text start="249.359" dur="7.261">shortages a while ago and I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="4.86">the places are starting to get ammo back</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="6.06">on the shelves or even on sites it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="7.411">as the at the mo is not as sold out as</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="8.12">it once was I mean I just I see stock</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="7.83">coming back but my question is was it</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="7.27">ammo that people were purchasing</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="6.96">is it ammo that was the DHS that the DHS</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="6.21">was purchasing and I&amp;#39;m wondering was the</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="10.11">DHS trying to purchase as much ammo as</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="8.67">possible combined with those who are</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="3.57">buying ammo because they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="6.81">the collapse and the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="8.94">and the I mean the gun grab so was that</text>
  <text start="299.76" dur="6.36">a combination and now you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="4.2">starting to normalize and and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="3.87">starting to see ammo back on the shelves</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="5.16">because I was looking at some of the</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="4.71">sites that I purchase a mowatt and I see</text>
  <text start="313.17" dur="7.23">that they do I mean at one time it was</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="9.15">all 0 and but some of it is still I</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="7.08">can&amp;#39;t find like the 9-millimeter I I</text>
  <text start="323.85" dur="7.5">still can&amp;#39;t find anywhere and i usually</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="6.3">buy hornady Critical Defense or critical</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="11.22">duty and it&amp;#39;s very very difficult to</text>
  <text start="333.78" dur="11.15">find and but you see still some ammo</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="5.25">still coming back not all of it but</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="6.7">there there&amp;#39;s still a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="7.22">ammo shortages and I was just pondering</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="14.76">what you know could it be from both and</text>
  <text start="355.04" dur="13.81">is that why we&amp;#39;re seeing this now now it</text>
  <text start="366.39" dur="3.81">seems as I&amp;#39;m look we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="368.85" dur="4.02">the Second Amendment in the ammo</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="10.32">shortages and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="11.64">setting up some type of law that if the</text>
  <text start="380.52" dur="9.45">sheriff&amp;#39;s are going to abide by the</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="12">Second Amendment that they could be</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="9.96">arrested by the Secret Service now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="5.46">never heard of a law that could will</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="5.09">actually i have but i mean we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="5.89">about a law that will override the</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="5.29">constitution and when I when I</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="5.85">what I just corrected myself the ndaa</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="8.889">also overrides the Constitution because</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="8.389">there&amp;#39;s no due process here this is</text>
  <text start="419.199" dur="7.551">really overriding the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="8.56">where if the if the if the sheriff&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="9.33">decide to back up the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="430.659" dur="8.69">and not and and and don&amp;#39;t abide by the</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="7.57">executive order from the President or</text>
  <text start="439.349" dur="6.241">any law from the government that they</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="7.37">can be arrested by the Secret Service</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="8.5">which to me is they&amp;#39;re ripping this our</text>
  <text start="451.02" dur="5.169">Constitution to shreds here if they</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="5.75">continually do this I mean with the</text>
  <text start="456.189" dur="11.01">Patriot Act with you know wiretapping</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="9.069">search the NDAA and now this to me we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.199" dur="6.77">just there just like ripping the</text>
  <text start="468.909" dur="10.26">Constitution apart and this is a sign</text>
  <text start="473.969" dur="11.17">this is an indicator that we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="479.169" dur="9">closer because this only happens when</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="5.671">you get closer you try to get rid of</text>
  <text start="488.169" dur="8.701">those laws that can stop you from doing</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="7.409">things it&amp;#39;s the only reason I mean we</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="5.34">can see other things that are happening</text>
  <text start="498.219" dur="5.7">but you know if you if you really look</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="5.639">at this and you say to yourself well how</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="5.821">could this happen just like in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="507.849" dur="4.591">well how can they just take the money</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="4.529">from the people this is these are all</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="4.95">the signs this is where everywhere you</text>
  <text start="514.269" dur="5.31">look you can see things happening and</text>
  <text start="517.39" dur="6">when you see more and more of these</text>
  <text start="519.579" dur="6.331">little things happening that tells you</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="6.33">something just like they reintroduce the</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="7.47">bill to keep the president for another</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="6.349">term they did it again now there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.949">one reason why you would want him again</text>
  <text start="536.069" dur="5.441">because if we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="538.329" dur="5.491">collapse they want him in</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="6.42">place the central bankers because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="5.76">doing what they want just like when</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="4.62">everyone thought Mitt Romney was gonna</text>
  <text start="549.58" dur="5.58">win the election or Ron Paul no they</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="4.92">already trained Obama there&amp;#39;s no need to</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="4.68">bring anybody else into this he was</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="5.55">trained he&amp;#39;s doing what he&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="6.54">be doing and that&amp;#39;s it and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="6.66">you know another bill is being</text>
  <text start="566.38" dur="5.01">reintroduced because they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="3.93">bring someone else into the fold and</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="4.35">have to explain what&amp;#39;s going on and to</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="6.51">force them to follow what they want to</text>
  <text start="575.74" dur="6.24">do they already have a guy so these are</text>
  <text start="580.12" dur="5.1">the little signs and a little tidbits</text>
  <text start="581.98" dur="5.01">that we&amp;#39;re seeing and these are the</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="6.89">things that you have to hold on to to</text>
  <text start="586.99" dur="8.19">say yes it&amp;#39;s true it is coming and</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="5.62">here&amp;#39;s another story of Australia wants</text>
  <text start="595.18" dur="3.84">to cut out the US dollar in trades with</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="4.98">China they don&amp;#39;t want to use the dollar</text>
  <text start="599.02" dur="7.98">now this is another sign this is telling</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="8.49">you I mean in our history when have we</text>
  <text start="607" dur="8.78">seen China Russia the Middle East all</text>
  <text start="611.2" dur="9.06">these countries now Australia Venezuela</text>
  <text start="615.78" dur="9.67">all these countries wanting to trade</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="8.76">without the US dollar and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="625.45" dur="7.8">we&amp;#39;re in these countries to force them</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="7.2">back to the US dollar because without it</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="4.44">without them trading the US dollar they</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t need they don&amp;#39;t need to hold the</text>
  <text start="637.69" dur="4.44">dollar anymore so if you&amp;#39;re not holding</text>
  <text start="640" dur="4.8">the dollar where does it go it comes</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="4.8">back to the United States it comes back</text>

  <text start="651.54" dur="7.33">floods our country you see</text>
  <text start="654.16" dur="7.64">hyperinflation so these are the signs</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="5.54">this is what we&amp;#39;re looking at and</text>
  <text start="661.8" dur="5.5">Australia you know once the bypass</text>
  <text start="664.41" dur="4.45">trading with the US dollar with China an</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="3.99">effort to avoid the commercial entities</text>
  <text start="668.86" dur="5.43">that come with the recent fluctuations</text>
  <text start="671.29" dur="4.979">in the greenback so I mean there were</text>
