  <text start="170.38" dur="4.91">made that up now if they had the</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.76">evidence they would have never</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="6.279">apologized for this but again we can see</text>
  <text start="178.66" dur="4.98">they just make this stuff up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="5.701">hoping that nobody calls them on it</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="7.34">well what we need to do today is we need</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="6.75">to call all these news organizations on</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.83">everything everything that they are</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="7.62">reporting that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that</text>
  <text start="196.81" dur="8.63">is not backed up by evidence by fact we</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="7.17">need to call them on it plain and simple</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="5.56">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is that</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.62">the corporate media the government the</text>
  <text start="211" dur="5.4">elite essential bankers they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="6.11">after fake news because they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="216.4" dur="6.45">who are putting out the fake news</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re really going after those people</text>
  <text start="222.85" dur="4.32">who are trying to tell the truth of</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="5.16">what&amp;#39;s really going on here so we need</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="4.62">to keep the pressure on them to</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="4.59">continually show them that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="5.31">watching we know what you&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="6.54">going to call you out on it and you need</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="8.58">to start using facts if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="9.12">be the official journalists the official</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="6.66">news organizations and you have to show</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="4.739">that you&amp;#39;re actually doing investigative</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="5.459">work but we can see they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="5.52">controlled by what is a 527 corporations</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="5.041">they get their stories from the CIA from</text>
  <text start="260.229" dur="7.831">the government and they&amp;#39;re just pretty</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="7.17">much a repeating news source I mean you</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="4.02">could see it on Conan O&amp;#39;Brien where he</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="3.96">puts together those videos where they</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="3.51">show news organizations all around the</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="3.39">world I mean all over the country i</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="5.04">should say and they&amp;#39;re just repeating</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="5.28">the same exact story word for word which</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="4.68">shows you that everything&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="282.64" dur="6.12">scripted now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="7.56">about all of this is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="7.68">asking why didn&amp;#39;t the FBI investigate</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="7.02">the hacks into uh the hacking of the</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="7.02">server&amp;#39;s of the DNC servers why weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.89" dur="6.96">they involved why did the DNC use a</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="5.579">private company to investigate shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="4.379">this go to the FBI shouldn&amp;#39;t they have</text>
  <text start="309.039" dur="4.681">the ability to go in there with a</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="4.5">forensic team to look at the servers but</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="2.88">they didn&amp;#39;t want them in there they</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="3.451">didn&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="5.01">looking around so the question is why</text>
  <text start="319.18" dur="5.97">and that&amp;#39;s what we do we ask questions</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="7.68">why didn&amp;#39;t this happen this way what are</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="6.39">they hiding I mean if there was a murder</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="4.74">or anything else happened you know in</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="5.01">any of your towns would you hire a</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="5.1">private company or with the police come</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="5.46">in and do an investigation and we can</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="5.43">see that there were no US intelligence</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="4.86">agencies that did any type of</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="5.19">independent forensic analysis on the</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="5.88">server&amp;#39;s whatsoever now when clapper was</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="5.64">testifying in front of Congress he</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="5.82">didn&amp;#39;t show any evidence whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="6.33">he did say that hacking was only part of</text>
  <text start="358.57" dur="7.68">the problem he&amp;#39;s saying that Russia used</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="7.71">propaganda disinformation fake news they</text>
  <text start="366.25" dur="5.76">swayed the people into a different</text>
  <text start="369.43" dur="5.55">direction the direction of Trump and</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s how they did it so really what</text>
  <text start="374.98" dur="3.39">he&amp;#39;s saying is we have no evidence</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="5.04">whatsoever we&amp;#39;re just telling you what</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="5.1">we think we have no proof that Russia</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="4.35">actually hacked anything and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="383.47" dur="4.74">making all this up right now because</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="7.47">none of that is proof they haven&amp;#39;t shown</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="6.51">any proof as of yet now WikiLeaks was</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="4.23">quick to highlight that according to the</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="5.03">report US officials admitted that the</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="4.76">WikiLeaks source was not Russia and the</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="6.67">goalpost now shifted to the sources</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="9.07">source so they changed the story once</text>
  <text start="406.42" dur="7.08">again saying okay Russia was involved in</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="6.41">handing the information off to WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="7.83">now again there was no proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="6.19">they couldn&amp;#39;t find any proof and all</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re doing is switching the story up</text>
  <text start="423.64" dur="5.64">every time they get caught they move in</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="5.49">a different direction and all the</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="7.23">information they continually push out</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="9.35">there is innuendo it&amp;#39;s made up phrases</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="6.96">it&amp;#39;s high confidence let me look at the</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="5.02">headline for Washington Post&amp;#39;s us</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="5.19">intercepts capture senior Russian</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.14">officials celebrating Trump win NBC News</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="4.66">top Russians celebrate</text>
  <text start="450.44" dur="6.12">when Trump won the hill you escort</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="5.31">Russian officials cheering Trump win so</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="4.56">what does this really mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="4.86">saying because the Russian officials</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="5.4">were happy that Trump won they must have</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="5.07">manipulated the elections I mean does</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="4.77">that make any sense where&amp;#39;s the proof in</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="5.7">that so if the Russian officials cheered</text>
  <text start="471.29" dur="6.69">for a football team in America let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="6.96">the dolphins and a one they must have</text>
  <text start="477.98" dur="7.89">manipulated the game I mean what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="9.24">saying makes no sense now John McAfee is</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="9.6">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying listen this</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="7.14">whole thing is completely made up he</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.89">goes think about what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="5.7">convince us of they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="7.08">that they used malware in the Russian</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="7.98">language they use a Russian language</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="7.409">keyboard to create the malware the</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="6.21">compiler and the time stamp was during</text>
  <text start="514.849" dur="6.481">Russian business hours and the IP</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="7.8">address the two came from Russia he goes</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="6.86">how stupid do they think we are that we</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="7.05">would believe that a state-sponsored</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="6.76">country would actually do it in this way</text>
  <text start="532.34" dur="5.46">where they leave all the footprints that</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="5.91">points back to them it&amp;#39;s almost the same</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="7.92">thing as do you really believe those</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="7.08">passports fell from the sky when those</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="6.42">planes hit the World Trade Center and</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="7.32">they were completely void of any burn</text>
  <text start="552.14" dur="7.5">marks they just were pristine on the</text>
  <text start="555.26" dur="6.96">ground or when we had the false flag in</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="6.09">France and they found the passport on</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="6.42">the ground or the latest false flag in</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="8.04">Berlin where they found the ID just</text>
  <text start="568.64" dur="6.3">laying there they do this to set up who</text>
  <text start="573.77" dur="4.5">they want that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="5.79">false flags they need that type of</text>
  <text start="578.27" dur="5.33">evidence but again they&amp;#39;re missing</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="5.81">something very important the acts</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="5.01">link that links it back to the Russian</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="4.5">government just because something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="5.25">written in Russian just because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="4.349">compiled in the hours of Russia and just</text>
  <text start="593.86" dur="3.3">because they have two IP addresses that</text>
  <text start="595.389" dur="5.961">out of eight hundred and something IP</text>
  <text start="597.16" dur="7.65">addresses doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s Russia yes</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="5.969">those show Russian information but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="5.389">not a link that they actually did this</text>
  <text start="607.319" dur="7.181">because anybody could have done it and</text>
  <text start="610.199" dur="6.301">he&amp;#39;s saying listen this is all the</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="6.149">hallmarks of a fifteen-year-old kid</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="6.85">acting alone or a poorly fabricated body</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="6.56">of evidence he says because no state</text>
  <text start="623.35" dur="7.289">actor would actually do it in this way</text>
  <text start="627.209" dur="5.411">and he&amp;#39;s right nobody would now</text>
  <text start="630.639" dur="3.89">something very interesting CNBC chief</text>
  <text start="632.62" dur="6.719">Washington correspondent John Harwood</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="7.12">well he took a poll and he asked listen</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="5.81">do you believe WikiLeaks or do you</text>
  <text start="641.649" dur="6.331">believe the US intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="645.149" dur="6.221">which do you believe and he did this</text>
  <text start="647.98" dur="6.029">poll on Twitter and I think he was a</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="5.04">little surprised of how the poll results</text>
  <text start="654.009" dur="4.5">came out because fifty-five percent said</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="4.83">they believe WikiLeaks and forty-five</text>
  <text start="658.509" dur="7.411">percent said they believe the US intel</text>
  <text start="661.24" dur="6.48">officials so it shows the people right</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.56">now are saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="667.72" dur="6.239">don&amp;#39;t believe anything these agencies</text>
  <text start="670.48" dur="5.31">are telling us and you know something we</text>
  <text start="673.959" dur="6.75">shouldn&amp;#39;t believe them until they show</text>
  <text start="675.79" dur="7.34">actual proof and links period and we</text>
  <text start="680.709" dur="4.62">have to remember where these</text>
  <text start="683.13" dur="4.8">intelligence agencies got all this</text>
  <text start="685.329" dur="6.211">information it was from a third party</text>
  <text start="687.93" dur="7.509">they really never went in and looked at</text>
  <text start="691.54" dur="10.08">the actual servers so this stuff was</text>
  <text start="695.439" dur="9.121">handed off and to me this was a false</text>
  <text start="701.62" dur="5.819">flag to try to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="704.56" dur="5.459">Russia to try to start war with Russia</text>
  <text start="707.439" dur="4.26">and you know what they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="710.019" dur="3.601">let up they&amp;#39;re going to push this as</text>
  <text start="711.699" dur="5.131">hard as they possibly can until they get</text>
  <text start="713.62" dur="6.42">that war now NBC put out</text>
  <text start="716.83" dur="7.28">uh parts of the top secret intelligence</text>
  <text start="720.04" dur="7.26">report and it was leaked to NBC and</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="5.68">Trump wasn&amp;#39;t even briefed yet he hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="727.3" dur="5.34">even seen it so Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="5.7">asking well this is kind of strange I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="6">the president the president-elect is not</text>
  <text start="735.49" dur="6.87">sworn in yet and this news organization</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="7.65">NBC received the secret intelligence</text>
  <text start="742.36" dur="8.34">report before me now Obama saw it on</text>
  <text start="746.29" dur="7.32">Thursday they gave it to trump on friday</text>
  <text start="750.7" dur="5.76">but NBC received at first and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.61" dur="6.51">saying well this 50-page report it was</text>
  <text start="756.46" dur="7.29">leaked and we have leaks inside the</text>

  <text start="775.32" dur="10.45">had a meeting he looked at it and he saw</text>
  <text start="780.06" dur="10.57">nothing that the hacking that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="785.77" dur="7.4">talking about had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="6.33">outcome of the elections whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="793.17" dur="7.75">what he did say was that yes there are</text>
  <text start="796.96" dur="7.89">different countries trying to hack the</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="9.09">election system the DNC the government</text>
  <text start="804.85" dur="9.18">and yes this is true if you look at your</text>
  <text start="810.01" dur="8.85">own router information and I look mine</text>
  <text start="814.03" dur="8.16">up today you will see probes ongoing</text>
  <text start="818.86" dur="5.7">probes from all over the world trying to</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="3.84">get into your system I mean I saw up</text>
  <text start="824.56" dur="3.96">mostly they&amp;#39;re coming from Ukraine which</text>
  <text start="826.03" dur="5.54">is kind of strange but there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="828.52" dur="6.66">coming and hitting my route my firewall</text>
  <text start="831.57" dur="6.01">from Ukraine I see from Great Britain I</text>

  <text start="837.58" dur="6.12">some from Russia China North Korea now</text>
  <text start="841.66" dur="3.6">most likely these are individuals that</text>
  <text start="843.7" dur="5.7">are trying to mess things up and do</text>
  <text start="845.26" dur="5.38">these things but all these areas and</text>
  <text start="849.4" dur="4.44">especially the</text>
  <text start="850.64" dur="6.39">the big government offices the</text>
  <text start="853.84" dur="5.71">corporations individuals are always</text>
  <text start="857.03" dur="4.08">trying to bring the system&amp;#39;s down yes we</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="4.59">do have bad people out there that like</text>
  <text start="861.11" dur="6.71">to do these type of things it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="864.14" dur="6.12">mean that it was Russia it was China</text>
  <text start="867.82" dur="4.66">just because you see Russia and China</text>
  <text start="870.26" dur="3.93">with the IP address because I mean I</text>
  <text start="872.48" dur="3.33">could see Washington DC should I say the</text>
  <text start="874.19" dur="3.99">United States is trying to hack into my</text>
  <text start="875.81" dur="5.13">stuff well that&amp;#39;s kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="878.18" dur="5.04">because I really don&amp;#39;t have anything so</text>
  <text start="880.94" dur="4.59">this is not proof I remember</text>
  <text start="883.22" dur="4.59">professional hackers they bounce it off</text>
  <text start="885.53" dur="4.23">many different servers and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="5.97">very difficult to track down you really</text>
  <text start="889.76" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t do it but we see the intelligence</text>
  <text start="893.78" dur="5.31">agencies well they&amp;#39;re switching</text>
  <text start="895.31" dur="6.8">directions now and they&amp;#39;re coming out</text>
  <text start="899.09" dur="7.95">with more information that Putin ordered</text>
  <text start="902.11" dur="7.92">to influence the 2016 presidential</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="5.49">election Russia&amp;#39;s goals were to</text>
  <text start="910.03" dur="5.11">undermine the public faith in the US</text>
  <text start="912.53" dur="5.97">democratic process again we have to go</text>
  <text start="915.14" dur="6.24">back to what proof is there well there</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="5.85">is none this is what the intelligence</text>
  <text start="921.38" dur="5.82">agencies state we have high confidence</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="5.76">which we have which means we have no</text>
  <text start="927.2" dur="5.76">proof in these judgments so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="930.11" dur="7.38">making judgments now without any hard</text>
  <text start="932.96" dur="7.14">facts or evidence so we can say they had</text>
  <text start="937.49" dur="5.13">high confidence that Iraq had weapons of</text>
  <text start="940.1" dur="5.46">mass destruction is that what they said</text>
  <text start="942.62" dur="8.1">back then which turned out to be fake</text>
  <text start="945.56" dur="9.32">phony and false so the report lacks any</text>
  <text start="950.72" dur="7.74">evidence but it is rich in judgments</text>
  <text start="954.88" dur="6.52">such as the following we assess Russian</text>
  <text start="958.46" dur="5.28">President Putin ordered an influence</text>
  <text start="961.4" dur="4.2">campaign in 2016 aimed at the u.s.</text>
  <text start="963.74" dur="3.69">presidential election Russia&amp;#39;s goals</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="4.53">were to undermine public faith in the US</text>
  <text start="967.43" dur="5.94">democratic process denigrate Secretary</text>
  <text start="970.13" dur="7.86">Clinton and harm her electability and</text>
  <text start="973.37" dur="6.3">potential presidency really and what</text>
  <text start="977.99" dur="2.97">proof do you have of that none</text>
  <text start="979.67" dur="4.53">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re just making this</text>
  <text start="980.96" dur="5.04">stuff up we further assess</text>
  <text start="984.2" dur="5.37">and the Russian government developed a</text>
  <text start="986" dur="6.27">clear preference for Trump who cares and</text>
  <text start="989.57" dur="5.96">I&amp;#39;m sure other countries had a</text>
  <text start="992.27" dur="7.59">preference for Clinton like the UK maybe</text>
  <text start="995.53" dur="9.4">like Canada maybe we have high</text>
  <text start="999.86" dur="8.76">confidence in these judgments which</text>
  <text start="1004.93" dur="6.09">means we have nothing they have nothing</text>
  <text start="1008.62" dur="4.23">at all there are no facts there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1011.02" dur="6.06">evidence there is absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="1012.85" dur="8.31">they&amp;#39;re just talking and talking and</text>
  <text start="1017.08" dur="5.13">talking making up stuff to bake people</text>
  <text start="1021.16" dur="3.21">believe but they&amp;#39;re not going to give up</text>
  <text start="1022.21" dur="4.86">because I already see all over the</text>
  <text start="1024.37" dur="5.1">corporate media that Putin is the blame</text>
  <text start="1027.07" dur="4.769">Putin is to blame that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1029.47" dur="7.29">doing because you know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1031.839" dur="7.891">caught they&amp;#39;re caught in a lie so they</text>
  <text start="1036.76" dur="5.49">have to create a new lie and again if</text>
  <text start="1039.73" dur="5.849">they want us to believe it&amp;#39;s very simple</text>
  <text start="1042.25" dur="5.1">show us evidence show as facts that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1045.579" dur="5.131">all you have to do because you do have</text>
  <text start="1047.35" dur="5.24">to prove it to the American people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1050.71" dur="6.45">not just going to believe you anymore</text>
  <text start="1052.59" dur="7.69">that time has passed now out in North</text>
  <text start="1057.16" dur="5.34">Korea we see thousands of North Koreans</text>
  <text start="1060.28" dur="4.32">they gathered for a rally to show their</text>

  <text start="1099.04" dur="4.47">different cases where well this might</text>
  <text start="1100.81" dur="4.11">turn into a full-blown war yeah it means</text>
  <text start="1103.51" dur="3.9">what we&amp;#39;re what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1104.92" dur="6.27">attacking a country that never attacked</text>
  <text start="1107.41" dur="5.7">us and if anyone did that to United</text>
  <text start="1111.19" dur="4.1">States say North Korea flew there Jetson</text>
  <text start="1113.11" dur="4.38">and they attacked a nuclear facility</text>
  <text start="1115.29" dur="2.739">wouldn&amp;#39;t that be an attack on the United</text>

  <text start="1131.08" dur="7.769">in Yemen and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1135.999" dur="5.071">the Houthi forces they are really</text>
  <text start="1138.849" dur="4.8">pushing the paid mercenaries of Saudi</text>

  <text start="1145.989" dur="4.41">first plane is going to take off from</text>
  <text start="1148.059" dur="6.631">Aleppo International Airport after four</text>
  <text start="1150.399" dur="6.51">years so while the moderate rebels while</text>
  <text start="1154.69" dur="4.589">the terrorist groups where the United</text>
  <text start="1156.909" dur="4.171">States supported them were in Aleppo no</text>
  <text start="1159.279" dur="4.411">planes were flying in and out of that</text>
  <text start="1161.08" dur="4.979">area as soon as they moderate rebels and</text>
  <text start="1163.69" dur="4.979">the terrorist forces were removed all of</text>
  <text start="1166.059" dur="6">a sudden the airport can open up once</text>
  <text start="1168.669" dur="5.67">again Russia begins slow withdrawal of</text>
  <text start="1172.059" dur="6.12">their forces from Syria since we have</text>
  <text start="1174.339" dur="6.121">this ceasefire piece on inside of Syria</text>
  <text start="1178.179" dur="5.1">right now they&amp;#39;re removing some of their</text>
  <text start="1180.46" dur="5.519">forces now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="1183.279" dur="6.39">that turkey is now coming out saying</text>
  <text start="1185.979" dur="5.79">well we are baffled that the US military</text>
  <text start="1189.669" dur="4.17">is using our insular air base and</text>
  <text start="1191.769" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re not really hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1193.839" dur="5.04">state targets well turkeys just playing</text>
  <text start="1196.839" dur="3.63">stupid right now because they knew</text>
  <text start="1198.879" dur="3.9">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on because they</text>
  <text start="1200.469" dur="3.84">supported the Islamic state well they</text>
  <text start="1202.779" dur="3.87">might be turning on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1204.309" dur="5.34">now moving closer to Russia because they</text>
  <text start="1206.649" dur="6.15">can seem well the end is near here and I</text>
  <text start="1209.649" dur="6.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if turkey asks the</text>
  <text start="1212.799" dur="6.81">US and the coalition forces to leave</text>
  <text start="1216.059" dur="7.271">this entire area to leave incirlik air</text>
  <text start="1219.609" dur="6.66">base because what they&amp;#39;re pointing out</text>
  <text start="1223.33" dur="5.519">right now is that the US has never been</text>
  <text start="1226.269" dur="4.47">going after the Islamic state and we</text>
  <text start="1228.849" dur="3.66">know that turkey did support the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1230.739" dur="3.87">state they were making a lot of money</text>
  <text start="1232.509" dur="6.181">from the oil that was being stolen from</text>
  <text start="1234.609" dur="6.99">Syria brought into turkey Russia pointed</text>
  <text start="1238.69" dur="6.959">this out they had evidence showing how</text>
  <text start="1241.599" dur="6.721">this happened and now they&amp;#39;re doing a</text>
  <text start="1245.649" dur="4.74">180 degree turn and moving closer to</text>
  <text start="1248.32" dur="3.06">Russia and trying to separate themselves</text>
  <text start="1250.389" dur="2.751">from</text>
  <text start="1251.38" dur="4.26">the Islamic state from the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1253.14" dur="7">coalition forces that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1255.64" dur="8.64">seeing right now now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1260.14" dur="7.02">today is there was a shooting in fort</text>
  <text start="1264.28" dur="5.51">lauderdale airport and when we look at</text>
  <text start="1267.16" dur="7.17">this we have to ask ourselves a question</text>
  <text start="1269.79" dur="7.78">why is this happening and remember back</text>
  <text start="1274.33" dur="8.45">in december i think was 14 2016 it was</text>
  <text start="1277.57" dur="8.91">episode 1152 where i mentioned that</text>
  <text start="1282.78" dur="7.57">Obama was resubmitting the UN arms trade</text>
  <text start="1286.48" dur="6.99">treaty back into the Senate and we know</text>
  <text start="1290.35" dur="6.51">that the Senators were never going to</text>
  <text start="1293.47" dur="5.16">look at it we know that they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1296.86" dur="4.32">going to pass it they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1298.63" dur="5.22">nothing with it and the only way to get</text>
  <text start="1301.18" dur="5.55">traction on this type of legislation is</text>
  <text start="1303.85" dur="4.77">to have an event and I said back in</text>
  <text start="1306.73" dur="6.12">December you know we might see something</text>
  <text start="1308.62" dur="6.54">from that point in December 14th 2016 up</text>
  <text start="1312.85" dur="3.48">to the time that Trump is inaugurated</text>
  <text start="1315.16" dur="3.39">because that&amp;#39;s the time that Obama has</text>
  <text start="1316.33" dur="3.84">left and he really wants this push</text>
  <text start="1318.55" dur="3.06">through because we know when Trump is</text>
  <text start="1320.17" dur="2.64">inaugurated he&amp;#39;s not going to do</text>
  <text start="1321.61" dur="3.03">anything with the UN arms trade treaty</text>
  <text start="1322.81" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s just gonna be dead in the water we</text>
  <text start="1324.64" dur="3.78">know that John Kerry already signed it</text>
  <text start="1326.05" dur="4.8">he just needs to send it to approve it</text>
  <text start="1328.42" dur="4.5">and then of course Obama will add his</text>
  <text start="1330.85" dur="4.98">signature to it so they needed some type</text>
  <text start="1332.92" dur="5.37">of an event and I said well the schools</text>
  <text start="1335.83" dur="4.68">are closed during the holiday season so</text>
  <text start="1338.29" dur="4.14">most likely it won&amp;#39;t be a school I said</text>
  <text start="1340.51" dur="4.89">maybe it could be a mall where we see</text>
  <text start="1342.43" dur="5.49">some type of an attack but again retail</text>
  <text start="1345.4" dur="6.09">so bad not many people in the malls so</text>
  <text start="1347.92" dur="6.57">they used an airport do you have a false</text>
  <text start="1351.49" dur="6.57">flag now a false flag doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="1354.49" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s all fake a false flag is used to</text>
  <text start="1358.06" dur="3.81">push an agenda and they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1360.43" dur="3.12">people get hurt they don&amp;#39;t care people</text>
  <text start="1361.87" dur="4.98">get killed they could care less about</text>
  <text start="1363.55" dur="4.83">that and we&amp;#39;re getting reports where</text>
  <text start="1366.85" dur="3.44">they&amp;#39;re saying this individual flew in</text>
  <text start="1368.38" dur="4.44">from Canada had a military ID and</text>
  <text start="1370.29" dur="4.84">checked a weapon in his bag like a</text>
  <text start="1372.82" dur="4.41">pistol with ammunition then he went to</text>
  <text start="1375.13" dur="4.65">the baggage claim took it out and</text>
  <text start="1377.23" dur="5.82">started shooting people in the head now</text>
  <text start="1379.78" dur="5.55">I witnesses on the ground said there</text>
  <text start="1383.05" dur="5.55">were other shooters there and it looks</text>
  <text start="1385.33" dur="8.22">they were carrying a ours or some type</text>
  <text start="1388.6" dur="6.9">of rifle type of weapon and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1393.55" dur="4.23">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="1395.5" dur="4.82">happened on a Friday and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="1397.78" dur="6">these false flags do happen on Fridays</text>
  <text start="1400.32" dur="7.05">now the shooter was in custody very</text>
  <text start="1403.78" dur="6.18">quickly and normally the shooter dies</text>
  <text start="1407.37" dur="5.38">they don&amp;#39;t like the shooter to talk that</text>
  <text start="1409.96" dur="4.86">much but they did capture him and I</text>
  <text start="1412.75" dur="4.26">think this happened way too fast they</text>
  <text start="1414.82" dur="4.83">thought maybe this individuals would be</text>
  <text start="1417.01" dur="4.83">able to run around and do more harm or</text>
  <text start="1419.65" dur="6.33">just continually run while the other</text>
  <text start="1421.84" dur="5.46">shooters shot more people and it started</text>
  <text start="1425.98" dur="2.97">out that there were multiple shooters</text>
  <text start="1427.3" dur="4.71">and then said no there was just one and</text>
  <text start="1428.95" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s normally how these things go it</text>
  <text start="1432.01" dur="5.34">happened in the baggage area where</text>
  <text start="1434.14" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no security whatsoever and you</text>
  <text start="1437.35" dur="3.18">can know you could tell right now what</text>
