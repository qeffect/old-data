  <text start="52.73" dur="7.23">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.18" dur="6.899">report my name is David episode 1376 a</text>
  <text start="59.96" dur="5.04">and today&amp;#39;s date is September 12th 2017</text>
  <text start="63.079" dur="4.351">and the thought of the episode is debt</text>
  <text start="65" dur="5.85">level hits 20 trillion was the debt</text>
  <text start="67.43" dur="6.09">clock just removed let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.85" dur="5.37">economic collapse financial news now out</text>
  <text start="73.52" dur="5.69">in the UK we understand that the brexit</text>
  <text start="76.22" dur="7.35">talks they are happening right now and</text>
  <text start="79.21" dur="6.79">EU the UK they are going at and it</text>
  <text start="83.57" dur="5.52">appears there is a disagreement over the</text>
  <text start="86" dur="6">divorce payments and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="89.09" dur="6.66">UK is saying listen we are not paying</text>
  <text start="92" dur="6.39">any type of punishment fee and the EU is</text>
  <text start="95.75" dur="6.09">accusing the UK of backtracking on its</text>
  <text start="98.39" dur="5.67">promise to pay this fee as it leaves the</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="3.69">EU and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="104.06" dur="3.66">everything is really starting to break</text>
  <text start="105.53" dur="6.39">down and they have gone absolutely</text>
  <text start="107.72" dur="6.39">nowhere now article 50 is clear once a</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="4.259">state leaves it has no further rights</text>
  <text start="114.11" dur="4.41">and benefits and no further duties or</text>
  <text start="116.179" dur="4.14">obligations it is of course true the</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="4.23">treaty does not prevent the EU accepting</text>
  <text start="120.319" dur="4.83">a payment volunteered by a departing</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="5.28">state if it wished to pay one however</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="5.7">the UK could not make such a payment</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="4.05">legally under our own laws and basically</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="2.941">they&amp;#39;re saying that they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="4.5">pay for this punishment payment now the</text>
  <text start="133.79" dur="7.559">EU is saying that yes we don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="7.379">that says we want our money this is how</text>
  <text start="141.349" dur="5.881">central bankers think and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="4.681">try to keep the UK in the system they</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t want anyone leaving the system</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="5.04">this doesn&amp;#39;t help what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="4.44">do and that is to basically control all</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="3.809">the countries and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pushing this as hard as</text>
  <text start="157.489" dur="3.481">they possibly can they&amp;#39;re gonna make it</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.339">as hard as they possibly can to make</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="5.46">sure that the UK does not leave and if</text>
  <text start="163.849" dur="4.081">they really do want to leave and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.43" dur="4.29">pushing towards that which they really</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="5.22">are they want them to pay this gigantic</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="5.04">fee and the British are saying that</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="5.55">listen the public won&amp;#39;t accept a</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="3.96">punishment payment so right now talks</text>
  <text start="178.7" dur="4.409">are stalled</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="6.21">they have gone nowhere now the US</text>
  <text start="183.109" dur="3.511">government bbl s the jolts they came out</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="3.419">with the</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="4.71">a u.s. job openings report and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.349" dur="3.481">saying that job openings they are</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="3.54">soaring now we&amp;#39;ve talked about this many</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="4.35">times before but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="5.46">about this is that we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="5.04">pattern before right before 2008 when</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="3.269">everything started to come down where we</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="4.46">saw that there were a lot of job</text>
  <text start="203.599" dur="6.901">openings people were getting hired and</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="6.04">all of a sudden we hit this height which</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="3.959">we are exactly where we were back then</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="5.849">and the whole thing started to fall</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="5.28">apart now remember the job openings a</text>
  <text start="218.569" dur="3.841">lot of the companies a lot of</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="4.951">corporations they aren&amp;#39;t bringing in</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="4.74">sales revenue yes earnings might look</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="4.109">like they are up but most of these</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="4.679">corporations they are in a hot they are</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="5.28">on a hiring freeze manufacturing a lot</text>
  <text start="231.829" dur="5.28">of plants right now they are not hiring</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="5.55">the auto manufacturing sector is not</text>
  <text start="237.109" dur="4.47">doing that well so a lot of these are</text>
  <text start="239.629" dur="3.211">open wrecks but they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="241.579" dur="3.361">fill them and they don&amp;#39;t want to get rid</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="2.91">of the open wrecks because they really</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="3.269">never get them back</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="4.349">so departments normally keep the open</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="4.89">wrecks open they interview people but</text>
  <text start="250.099" dur="5.881">they never hire anyone but the pattern</text>
  <text start="253.099" dur="6.63">is exactly what we&amp;#39;ve seen before and if</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="6.18">we go back to 2006 2007 we hit this</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="6.12">height where there was a lot of job</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="5.04">openings hires going on and then all of</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="5.63">a sudden everything started to crash</text>
  <text start="267.2" dur="7.68">we&amp;#39;re already on the down slide here in</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="6.97">2017 and it looks very very similar to</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.13">what happened back in 2008 so it looks</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="3.9">like we have another indicator that</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="4.68">shows us that we are in major major</text>
  <text start="282.349" dur="3.871">trouble right here now the Census Bureau</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.14">they came out with their income and</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="4.8">poverty report and it shows that real</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="6.209">household income in the u.s. hit a new</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="6.39">record high of 59 thousand in 2016 now</text>
  <text start="295.039" dur="5.071">you&amp;#39;re thinking to yourself well how</text>
  <text start="297.41" dur="4.5">could this possibly possibly be when we</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="4.92">know that wages and income they have</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="6.75">been declining well guess what the</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="6.33">Census Bureau has done they&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="5.31">their methodology and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="5.76">with unemployment we&amp;#39;ve seen it with GDP</text>
  <text start="313.97" dur="6.47">and here we&amp;#39;re seeing it with incomes</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="5.09">with wages and we know that the you</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="4.74">hit a new record high of 59 thousand</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="6.57">2016 thanks to a methodology change and</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="5.82">rising incomes of women real inflation</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.74">adjusted earnings of men are below where</text>
  <text start="331" dur="4.44">they were in 1973 and what they did was</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="5.55">they took some of that information from</text>
  <text start="335.44" dur="5.43">women stuffed it into men women and they</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="4.44">changed the calculation to show that</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="6.69">look everything is doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="343.51" dur="6.27">and we know that wages income they have</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="4.44">been declining but they&amp;#39;ve also done</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="4.38">this with poverty where it looks like</text>
  <text start="352" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s a lot less people that are in</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="3.51">poverty so they changed a methodology</text>
  <text start="355.9" dur="3.78">for income and wages they change the</text>
  <text start="357.67" dur="5.4">methodology for poverty and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="6.21">showing that these areas are okay right</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="5.76">now so when all else fails what do they</text>
  <text start="365.89" dur="5.28">do they change the calculation and if</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="4.95">you look at shadow stats basically you</text>
  <text start="371.17" dur="4.98">could see that he is using a calculation</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="4.5">that goes pretty darn far back and if</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="4.8">you use that calculation you can see GDP</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="4.95">unemployment and everything else well it</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="3.81">shows that we are in major major trouble</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="4.14">and what they&amp;#39;ve been doing is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="5.76">been changing this to basically fit into</text>
  <text start="387.37" dur="4.71">this recovery that were really not in to</text>
  <text start="390.52" dur="3.27">make everyone believe that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="4.17">recovery it&amp;#39;s almost like these subprime</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="4.74">securities where they were saying that</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="3.96">these were all triple-a they changed how</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="3.93">they looked at them they they basically</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="5.76">lied about it and they kept the light</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.73">going until the very end even know that</text>
  <text start="405.97" dur="3.69">all these mortgages within the subprime</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="4.35">securities most of the people were</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="4.71">defaulting they were completely garbage</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="3.42">it didn&amp;#39;t matter it the same thing was</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="4.56">happening now with all these statistics</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="5.52">now yesterday we talked about the VIX we</text>
  <text start="418.93" dur="4.23">talked about how Steve st. Angelo is</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="4.32">saying that we&amp;#39;re in major major trouble</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="6.36">well so jen is saying that we are</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="7.23">entering a dangerous volatility area so</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="5.7">it looks like so Jen Steve st. Angelo</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="3.75">and many others Bank of America they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="3.63">all saying we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="4.5">recession period and it&amp;#39;s becoming very</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="4.98">very dangerous and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="5.76">that we are headed into the same exact</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="5.91">period where we were back in 2008 a lot</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="4.439">of the economic indicators are lining up</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.59">a lot of them are reporting the exact</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="5.131">same way some of them are a lot worse</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="5.01">and then they were back in 2008 now</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="6.96">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the debt</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="5.82">level hit 20 trillion dollars we knew it</text>
  <text start="463.57" dur="3.96">was eventually going to hit that mark it</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="3.84">finally did even though Trump even</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="3.24">though that Trump was trying to cut a</text>
  <text start="469" dur="3.48">lot of the budget and stuff it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="3.69">really matter because they the</text>
  <text start="472.48" dur="4.02">government still needs to borrow the</text>
  <text start="474.46" dur="4.77">government needs to still add debt or it</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="4.14">cannot survive just by slashing a couple</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="2.64">of billion is not going to help</text>
  <text start="480.64" dur="3.12">especially when the debt is in the</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="3.33">trillion and all the entitlement</text>
  <text start="483.76" dur="2.88">programs and everything else that the</text>
  <text start="485.2" dur="3.87">government pays out is in the trillions</text>
  <text start="486.64" dur="3.69">billions does not help at this point but</text>
  <text start="489.07" dur="5.31">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="6">this is that the debt clock was detached</text>
  <text start="494.38" dur="4.56">from its location on the southeast</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="6.12">corner of 44th Street and 6th Avenue in</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="5.4">Manhattan and there is no more debt</text>
  <text start="502.45" dur="4.44">clock there now why did they do that</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="5.37">what was the purpose of doing that this</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="5.25">way if they take it away guess what the</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="5.16">debt just doesn&amp;#39;t exist they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="512.14" dur="4.32">people to see the debt and we could see</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="3.69">right now we&amp;#39;re getting to the point</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="3.33">where a lot of countries around the</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="4.31">world are looking at this and saying</text>
  <text start="519.79" dur="6.3">okay how high is this debt going to get</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="4.93">before something breaks and we could see</text>
  <text start="526.09" dur="3.57">at this point and we&amp;#39;ve been reporting</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="5.64">on it there are many countries right now</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="6.57">like Venezuela South Korea Russia China</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="5.91">and many others where they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="5.13">away from the dollar the making deals</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="2.97">with you on that ruble and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="3.03">saying we&amp;#39;re going to be using that</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="3.59">currency and many other countries are</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="4.56">starting to jump on this bandwagon</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="5.38">because they know the writing is on the</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="4.74">wall now it&amp;#39;s very interesting we have</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="6.27">the brexit going on right now and Pepe</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="6.47">griot he is out there and he is part of</text>
  <text start="557.56" dur="5.12">the five star movement and it looks like</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="7.87">once the elections are all said and done</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="7.12">he wants a new currency introduced after</text>
  <text start="568.03" dur="5.13">the elections that are scheduled for</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="4.71">next year their proposal will replace</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="4.02">previous calls to leave the Euro</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.07">completely now analysts say the parties</text>
  <text start="577.18" dur="4.23">this party is trying to appeal to anti</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="3.87">euro sentiment in the country while</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="4.59">avoiding the upheaval of an outright</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="4.28">exit now if they go to a new currency</text>
  <text start="586" dur="4.339">guess what I&amp;#39;m going to call</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="4.89">this an exit and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="5.731">countries looking at this saying you</text>
  <text start="592.62" dur="7.32">know something it is time to basically</text>
  <text start="596.07" dur="6.6">leave the EU the EU is run by non</text>
  <text start="599.94" dur="5.16">elected body trying to tell these</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.59">countries what to do and they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="3.63">these countries in debt they are</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="4.41">controlling these countries we see</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s many parts of countries like</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="3.719">Catalonia that are trying to separate</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="4.229">themselves from Spain and I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.389" dur="4.26">gonna see a lot more of this where these</text>
  <text start="617.699" dur="3.121">movements where they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="619.649" dur="4.021">listen we want a completely different</text>
  <text start="620.82" dur="6.03">currency or we need to completely</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="4.71">separate ourselves from the EU and I</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="3.21">think the brexit is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="4.079">of this and I think basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="5.01">going to happen now if Italy goes</text>
  <text start="632.459" dur="4.231">through with this and they get a new</text>
  <text start="635.07" dur="3.15">currency other countries are gonna</text>
  <text start="636.69" dur="4.53">follow through they&amp;#39;re gonna deal</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="4.5">outside the dollar most likely and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="656.73" dur="5.19">rising that this is not a good situation</text>
  <text start="659.1" dur="4.289">now I know Steve minuchin went in and</text>
  <text start="661.92" dur="4.68">said that the goal was there in Fort</text>
  <text start="663.389" dur="5.221">Knox this was basically to give the</text>

  <text start="698.91" dur="5.13">actually none of them and they only</text>
