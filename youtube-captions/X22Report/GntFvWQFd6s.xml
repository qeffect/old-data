  <text start="51.109" dur="6.601">coming and when this will be is the</text>
  <text start="54.62" dur="6.449">question we know it will happen we just</text>
  <text start="57.71" dur="5.369">don&amp;#39;t know exactly when and a lot of</text>
  <text start="61.069" dur="4.8">things are standing in the way right now</text>
  <text start="63.079" dur="5.821">and the powers that be are trying to</text>
  <text start="65.869" dur="5.851">figure out an alternate way of getting</text>
  <text start="68.9" dur="4.41">this war started but you know we look</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="3.81">around the world today we see the stock</text>

  <text start="80.48" dur="5.04">today we&amp;#39;re seeing goal being pushed</text>
  <text start="82.82" dur="6.24">down again because these central bankers</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="6.39">do not want people purchasing gold just</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="6.39">yet so they&amp;#39;re going to continually push</text>
  <text start="91.91" dur="6.42">this down until they cannot control it</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="4.47">anymore and you&amp;#39;ll know when they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.33" dur="4.8">be able to control this because gold</text>
  <text start="99.92" dur="7.67">will start to really push higher not by</text>
  <text start="103.13" dur="8.61">30 or 25 dollars we&amp;#39;re talking a hundred</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="5.68">150 and it will happen in one day and</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="3.6">then you&amp;#39;ll see it again the next day</text>
  <text start="113.27" dur="4.02">they will try to push it down but then</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="4.05">it will go higher and this is your</text>
  <text start="117.29" dur="6.689">signal that things are starting to move</text>
  <text start="119.39" dur="6.33">and let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="5.191">and I&amp;#39;m going to end up with what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.72" dur="6.799">going on and why we are seeing so many</text>
  <text start="129.17" dur="5.67">things happen right now I mean if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="132.519" dur="5.651">reading anything on the alternative</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="5.7">media in the regular mainstream you can</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="2.58">sometimes determine what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="2.49">on</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="3.9">on and there is a lot happening but</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="4.74">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="6.87">news we know that India is having major</text>
  <text start="147.77" dur="5.88">major problems and it looks like that</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="4.32">you know India is now considering a</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="5.58">radical plan to direct commercial banks</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="6">to buy gold from ordinary citizens</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="7.29">because India the people in India they</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="9.54">purchase a lot of gold to to ensure</text>
  <text start="166.52" dur="6.87">their wealth and they&amp;#39;re looking to buy</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="4.89">the gold from ordinary citizens and</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="5.43">divert it to precious metal refiners and</text>
  <text start="176.27" dur="5.61">attempt to curb imports and things take</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="6.45">some heat off of their plunging currency</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="6.39">and you know you can equate this to what</text>
  <text start="185.27" dur="6">happened in in America during the Great</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="4.83">Depression where they asked everyone to</text>
  <text start="191.27" dur="4.469">hand in their goal they&amp;#39;re going to pay</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="5.4">you in you know paper and ink which is</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="4.731">worth nothing because it&amp;#39;s plunging so</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="4.47">why would you hand in your gold but you</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="4.18">know the same thing happened you know</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="3.96">they they said ok we&amp;#39;ll give you twenty</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="6.3">dollars for that gold here in America</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="6.839">and they gave them paper and then they</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="5.49">resold it and up the price to $35</text>
  <text start="213.769" dur="4.321">because gold is worth a lot more than</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="4.23">this piece of paper that you have in</text>
  <text start="218.09" dur="6.149">your hand and the same thing seems to be</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="5.31">happening out in India and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="4.681">to see this happen all over the place I</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="7.53">mean things are just majorly starting to</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="7.11">fall apart we see in Germany their</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="6.66">unemployment is starting to inch up now</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="6.299">I I remember the eurozone and Merkel out</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="5.12">there saying that they&amp;#39;ve solved the</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="4.891">eurozone crisis there are no problems</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="3.22">unemployment is going to be going down</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="3.989">things are just going to be getting</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="5.46">better but what I&amp;#39;m seeing and hearing</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="5.28">are reports coming out saying that you</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="5.16">know with Portugal with Spain oh we had</text>
  <text start="256.489" dur="5.34">a miscalculation actually we&amp;#39;ll be going</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="5.39">back into recession and it will carry</text>
  <text start="261.829" dur="6.391">through you know through 2014</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="6.07">unemployment you know in France and in</text>
  <text start="268.22" dur="5.1">Spain and in Cyprus and in Greece are</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="3.99">starting to inch up now and they all</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="2.369">told us that everything was</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="4.2">under control and things are getting</text>
  <text start="275.689" dur="4.861">better but now we see it&amp;#39;s actually the</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="3.93">opposite and things are starting to move</text>
  <text start="280.55" dur="4.44">the opposite way and things are not</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="3.75">getting better and they did this as a</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.799">campaign they did it here in America</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="7.29">they did it across Europe the UK they</text>
  <text start="289.789" dur="7.951">tried to sell the people a bill of goods</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="7.53">that everything is looking a-okay</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="6.919">because you know what they knew what was</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="8.069">going to happen this fall early winter</text>
  <text start="304.659" dur="8.891">they knew that things were going to</text>
  <text start="309.349" dur="8.91">deteriorate quite quickly they do the</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="8.339">central bankers needed to start the war</text>
  <text start="318.259" dur="6.571">with Syria and Iran and bring in other</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="6.451">nations to cover up this economic</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="7.049">collapse they know this but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="5.389">want you to know so what do they do they</text>
  <text start="331.879" dur="5.701">tell you the housing is doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="333.729" dur="6.011">they tell you that unemployment is going</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="4.139">down they tell you that the older</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="5.519">European nations we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="5.971">fantastically the crisis is over I you</text>
  <text start="345.259" dur="6.02">know everything looks great and nothing</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.969">to worry about here because they know</text>
  <text start="351.279" dur="6.781">eventually this thing is going to</text>
  <text start="353.659" dur="8.25">completely crash and fall apart and</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="6.009">we&amp;#39;re seeing things like blackberry they</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="4.68">are having a very tough time their units</text>
  <text start="364.069" dur="5.25">aren&amp;#39;t selling and that company is not</text>
  <text start="366.589" dur="5.25">doing well and I said this in my other</text>
  <text start="369.319" dur="6.09">reports way back when you see them</text>
  <text start="371.839" dur="8.04">implement more taxes and have more</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="6.841">military drills you know the collapse is</text>
  <text start="379.879" dur="4.38">getting close and we see them trying to</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="6.33">create bills to tax ammunition and</text>
  <text start="384.259" dur="6.03">weapons at the to a two-for-one deal to</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="4.259">get the ammunition and weapons away from</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="5.701">the people and plus to build up revenue</text>
  <text start="392.839" dur="5.061">to pay for this incredible amount of</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="4.829">debt that the u.s. is holding right now</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="5.59">we also see that they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="400.819" dur="4.02">federal online shopping tax a lot of the</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3.78">states are starting to jump on board</text>
  <text start="404.839" dur="3.181">because you know those states that are</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="3.329">on</text>
  <text start="408.02" dur="4.92">verge of collapse are looking for</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="4.081">additional revenue I made for example in</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="4.62">New York they really want this online</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="5.19">tax why because without it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="5.34">losing about a billion dollars a year</text>
  <text start="419.87" dur="5.519">and they could really use this money the</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="4.65">same goes with all the other states plus</text>
  <text start="425.389" dur="4.861">the federal government so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="5.85">looking to get this done because right</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="6.389">now it&amp;#39;s a money grab type of situation</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="5.19">the United States government is looking</text>
  <text start="436.639" dur="4.831">around the world for those people who</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="4.829">have a dual passport to the US but are</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="3.509">living in other countries they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="443.419" dur="3.421">after your money they&amp;#39;re coming after</text>
  <text start="444.979" dur="4.381">the money in the Cayman Islands they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.84" dur="5.04">coming after the money in the Swiss bank</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="5.85">accounts no met doesn&amp;#39;t matter where</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="5.819">your money is they need it because the</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="5.07">system is falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.699" dur="5.671">doing everything and everything to get</text>
  <text start="460.28" dur="6.21">as much as they can before the entire</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.419">system comes down and you can see it</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="9.679">happening right in front of our faces if</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="13.081">you look now we know that Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="8.831">going to come into action on october</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="4.109">first it&amp;#39;s going to start and a lot of</text>
  <text start="485" dur="3.569">the health care providers are starting</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="3.571">to pull out of certain State and certain</text>
  <text start="488.569" dur="4.261">exchanges because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="3.899">involved with it and Aetna is one of</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="6">them they&amp;#39;re pulling out of New York and</text>
  <text start="494.449" dur="8.011">again if you really look at Obamacare it</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="6.57">is not to help people get health</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="4.769">insurance it&amp;#39;s to help the insurance</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="5.04">companies because interest rates are</text>
  <text start="507.229" dur="6.8">very very low right now it&amp;#39;s to help the</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="8.61">insurance companies charge higher prices</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="7.601">it&amp;#39;s to increase revenue for the federal</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.19">government because they know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="5.579">going to be a lot of people that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="8.159">sign on to Obamacare so they will have</text>
  <text start="527.209" dur="8.491">to pay taxes on as a penalty and this is</text>
  <text start="532.399" dur="5.671">additional revenue and again this is</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="3.96">more taxes and it&amp;#39;s a money grab they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="3.629">looking to get as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="3.599">can</text>
  <text start="541.699" dur="4.711">the other things that are happening</text>
  <text start="543.259" dur="4.591">right now we know that the UN arms</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="4.949">treaty and I know I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="7.109">hundreds of times and it seems you know</text>
  <text start="551.359" dur="5.73">unreal when I say it but believe me this</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="5.701">is going to happen in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="557.089" dur="6.72">weeks they are now starting the push on</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="6.929">the gun control issue because they know</text>
  <text start="563.809" dur="6.99">that this fall early winter the collapse</text>
  <text start="567.589" dur="6.511">is going to happen so Biden is out there</text>
  <text start="570.799" dur="7.59">Obama is out there and they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="7.949">have the executive orders that support</text>
  <text start="578.389" dur="6.06">the UN arms treaty and the gun bill they</text>
  <text start="582.049" dur="6.51">have been set and they just realized</text>
  <text start="584.449" dur="6.69">they forgot to add a couple more and one</text>
  <text start="588.559" dur="4.5">of the new policies will end a</text>
  <text start="591.139" dur="4.74">government practice that lets military</text>
  <text start="593.059" dur="6.03">weapons sold or donated by the US to</text>
  <text start="595.879" dur="5.73">allies be re-imported into the US by</text>
  <text start="599.089" dur="4.951">private entities where some may end up</text>
  <text start="601.609" dur="8.85">on the street so corporations and things</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="8.639">like that cannot get weapons and they</text>
  <text start="610.459" dur="4.5">found this to be a loophole and they</text>
  <text start="612.679" dur="4.14">forgot to close it so they&amp;#39;re adding</text>
  <text start="614.959" dur="4.56">this to the executive orders right now</text>
  <text start="616.819" dur="5.43">and we know for a fact that the gun</text>
  <text start="619.519" dur="5.61">bills are pending in the Senate they are</text>
  <text start="622.249" dur="4.62">going to have some type of event to get</text>
  <text start="625.129" dur="3.75">these things past there&amp;#39;s no other</text>
  <text start="626.869" dur="4.46">reason to have it pending in the Senate</text>
  <text start="628.879" dur="4.531">there&amp;#39;s no other reason to have all the</text>
  <text start="631.329" dur="5.32">executive orders I mean right after the</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="5.489">Sandy Hook shooting the president came</text>
  <text start="636.649" dur="5.19">out and you know listed all those 23</text>
  <text start="638.899" dur="5.96">executive orders and then after the gun</text>
  <text start="641.839" dur="6.84">bill wasn&amp;#39;t passed he created more</text>
  <text start="644.859" dur="6.91">executive orders which limited selling</text>
  <text start="648.679" dur="7.13">parts to weapons so these are all and</text>
  <text start="651.769" dur="7.91">you know also with having a database</text>
  <text start="655.809" dur="8.161">tracking weapons and things like that</text>
  <text start="659.679" dur="8.051">these are all put in place to support</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="7.269">the bills by themselves they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="5.699">anything so they already know that these</text>
  <text start="671.239" dur="4.29">are going to be passed no question about</text>
  <text start="673.429" dur="5.46">it the only thing their way</text>
  <text start="675.529" dur="5.91">for is their special false flag event to</text>
  <text start="678.889" dur="5.521">get these babies through it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="681.439" dur="5.31">thing with sista that is just sitting in</text>
  <text start="684.41" dur="4.349">the Senate also just waiting for the day</text>
  <text start="686.749" dur="3.75">I mean think about it these bills are</text>
  <text start="688.759" dur="4.08">just sitting there what are the what are</text>
  <text start="690.499" dur="4.02">all the Senators doing they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="3.961">letting it sit there until something</text>
  <text start="694.519" dur="5.43">happens and then they&amp;#39;ll say ho ho we</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="5.43">have something here now we can stop what</text>
  <text start="699.949" dur="3.961">just happened and they are going to do</text>
  <text start="702.23" dur="5.75">this and move on this very quickly</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="7.169">because they know that the collapse is</text>
  <text start="707.98" dur="5.609">coming this fall or early winter and</text>

  <text start="868.969" dur="6.78">why the NSA and all the other spy</text>

  <text start="1761.18" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s going to do that and what is</text>
  <text start="1764.54" dur="8.37">happening now is that the UN Security</text>

  <text start="1804.89" dur="7.05">going to be in this meeting and Russia</text>
  <text start="1808.76" dur="4.8">did call this and this could be that</text>
  <text start="1811.94" dur="4.14">maybe they have evidence that the rebels</text>
  <text start="1813.56" dur="4.56">actually used the chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1816.08" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re presenting it to them and saying</text>
  <text start="1818.12" dur="4.41">listen we have evidence do you really</text>
  <text start="1820.01" dur="3.87">want to go forward with this because if</text>
  <text start="1822.53" dur="4.08">you do then we&amp;#39;re going to release this</text>

  <text start="1826.61" dur="4.32">what actually happened and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1828.77" dur="3.9">see how that plays out and this is just</text>
  <text start="1830.93" dur="5.57">you know something i was thinking of</text>
  <text start="1832.67" dur="8.19">them that they might be talking about</text>
  <text start="1836.5" dur="7.05">but Buchanan is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1840.86" dur="5.67">again without congressional approval</text>
  <text start="1843.55" dur="4.75">this would be in an impeachable act and</text>
  <text start="1846.53" dur="5.12">they&amp;#39;re just letting the president know</text>
  <text start="1848.3" dur="6.59">don&amp;#39;t you do anything without consulting</text>
  <text start="1851.65" dur="8.65">Congress and getting approval from</text>
  <text start="1854.89" dur="9.69">Congress so back to my point here is</text>
  <text start="1860.3" dur="9.09">that the UN Security Council is being</text>
  <text start="1864.58" dur="6.97">asked to leave on Saturday morning which</text>

  <text start="1873.5" dur="4.299">coming up and this would be a perfect</text>
  <text start="1876.32" dur="5.829">scenario for</text>
  <text start="1877.799" dur="7.651">type of an attack but to have this</text>
  <text start="1882.149" dur="6.051">attack the president just can&amp;#39;t do just</text>
  <text start="1885.45" dur="6.599">do it so right now he is meeting with</text>
  <text start="1888.2" dur="6.28">Congress to discuss the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1892.049" dur="6.09">and did the see if you can get approval</text>
  <text start="1894.48" dur="9.539">from Congress the United States now has</text>
  <text start="1898.139" dur="9.24">called in a fifth US Navy destroyer so</text>
  <text start="1904.019" dur="8.461">now we have five destroyers sitting</text>
  <text start="1907.379" dur="11.28">outside of Syria and Iran interestingly</text>
  <text start="1912.48" dur="14.399">enough in Cyprus there are us stealth</text>
  <text start="1918.659" dur="14.76">drones there now and b-2 bombers sitting</text>
  <text start="1926.879" dur="8.91">in Cyprus at this time and the way this</text>
  <text start="1933.419" dur="5.97">could unfold let&amp;#39;s just make just want</text>
  <text start="1935.789" dur="7.71">to make this clear this war is going to</text>
  <text start="1939.389" dur="6.75">happen it doesn&amp;#39;t matter that the false</text>
  <text start="1943.499" dur="5.731">flag event of chemical weapons is</text>
  <text start="1946.139" dur="6.181">starting to fall apart they are taking</text>
  <text start="1949.23" dur="5.25">their time to figure out their next move</text>
  <text start="1952.32" dur="6.89">and when I say this i&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1954.48" dur="8.669">the US government Israel England</text>
  <text start="1959.21" dur="6.37">Australia they&amp;#39;re all together thinking</text>
  <text start="1963.149" dur="5.21">about what can we do to push this</text>
  <text start="1965.58" dur="6.27">forward we don&amp;#39;t have the UN behind us</text>
  <text start="1968.359" dur="7.42">the US doesn&amp;#39;t have the Congress Cameron</text>
  <text start="1971.85" dur="7.23">was shot down by the equivalent of the</text>
  <text start="1975.779" dur="5.671">US Congress so what do we need to get</text>
  <text start="1979.08" dur="4.349">this thing pushed forward because they</text>
  <text start="1981.45" dur="3.9">will not the central bankers will not</text>
  <text start="1983.429" dur="7.291">stop they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get into</text>
  <text start="1985.35" dur="7.5">Iran and Syria for over 20 years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1990.72" dur="5.429">been doing this and we what do we</text>
  <text start="1992.85" dur="8.779">understand here we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1996.149" dur="8.701">US dollar right now is on its last legs</text>
  <text start="2001.629" dur="8.471">they need to get into these two</text>
  <text start="2004.85" dur="6.76">countries to have them use the US dollar</text>
  <text start="2010.1" dur="3.97">as the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="2011.61" dur="5.37">me and they need to get into these</text>
  <text start="2014.07" dur="7.62">countries to set up a private central</text>
  <text start="2016.98" dur="9.51">bank if they cannot the US dollar is</text>
  <text start="2021.69" dur="8.43">done September fifth and September six</text>
  <text start="2026.49" dur="6.15">is the g20 meeting supposedly they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2030.12" dur="6.54">rumblings out there that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2032.64" dur="7.38">to discuss removing the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="2036.66" dur="7.11">reserve currency and replacing it with</text>
  <text start="2040.02" dur="5.19">some other currency most likely China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2043.77" dur="5.639">currency which is going to be backed by</text>
  <text start="2045.21" dur="8.899">gold so they are in a position right now</text>
  <text start="2049.409" dur="8.131">and the central bankers will not give up</text>
  <text start="2054.109" dur="7.57">they will go down kicking and screaming</text>
  <text start="2057.54" dur="6.599">and they will start World War three no</text>
  <text start="2061.679" dur="6.841">matter what will it happen this Friday</text>
  <text start="2064.139" dur="7.441">well the only way that I can see at this</text>
  <text start="2068.52" dur="7.28">point that this will move forward this</text>
  <text start="2071.58" dur="9.96">Friday is if there is another false flag</text>
  <text start="2075.8" dur="7.599">event I mean we have a lot the US has a</text>
  <text start="2081.54" dur="6.839">lot of military assets there they have</text>
  <text start="2083.399" dur="8.191">five destroyers two aircraft carriers to</text>

  <text start="2107.76" dur="6.39">put there to be the command center of</text>
  <text start="2111" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s going to happen in Syria we also</text>
  <text start="2114.15" dur="6">understand that they trained for months</text>
  <text start="2116.7" dur="5.1">now paid mercenary soldiers and they</text>
  <text start="2120.15" dur="3.9">deployed around august seventeenth</text>
  <text start="2121.8" dur="6.39">through the 19th and are on the Syrian</text>
  <text start="2124.05" dur="6.809">border or inside the Syrian border we</text>
  <text start="2128.19" dur="8.27">also know that they&amp;#39;re around there are</text>
  <text start="2130.859" dur="9.541">Marines standing by and we&amp;#39;ll be there</text>
  <text start="2136.46" dur="7.18">into Syria within hours if the president</text>
  <text start="2140.4" dur="4.95">decides to go ahead with this so this is</text>
  <text start="2143.64" dur="3.78">not a small</text>
  <text start="2145.35" dur="3.69">type of operation right now they</text>
  <text start="2147.42" dur="3.78">continually bring in more and more</text>
  <text start="2149.04" dur="5.73">assets and the plus they have the drones</text>
  <text start="2151.2" dur="9.21">ready they have bombers ready so this is</text>
  <text start="2154.77" dur="8.96">moving quickly into an area that they</text>
  <text start="2160.41" dur="10.08">need they know they need to get to</text>
  <text start="2163.73" dur="9.67">because they have to do this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2170.49" dur="5.67">turning back at this point they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="2173.4" dur="4.86">way they see is moving forward with this</text>
  <text start="2176.16" dur="4.98">this is why they&amp;#39;re sending more and</text>
  <text start="2178.26" dur="6.93">more equipment over and they realize</text>
  <text start="2181.14" dur="7.2">that the fiscal budget for the rebels</text>
  <text start="2185.19" dur="5.37">that gives them aid and weapons is up on</text>
  <text start="2188.34" dur="5.04">September 30th and they&amp;#39;d have to go</text>
  <text start="2190.56" dur="4.41">back to Congress and have a revote on</text>
  <text start="2193.38" dur="3.62">this and you know they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2194.97" dur="5.01">make this case again everything that</text>
  <text start="2197" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;ve been trying now for the last</text>
  <text start="2199.98" dur="5.16">couple of years with the rebels and the</text>
  <text start="2202.47" dur="5.61">chemical weapons have all failed I mean</text>
  <text start="2205.14" dur="4.98">really think about it they have tried</text>
  <text start="2208.08" dur="5.7">the chemical weapons story you know two</text>
  <text start="2210.12" dur="6.81">three four times now they bribed Putin</text>
  <text start="2213.78" dur="8.07">twice now to move out of the way he did</text>
  <text start="2216.93" dur="9.57">not they went down the humanitarian road</text>
  <text start="2221.85" dur="7.5">which didn&amp;#39;t work and they tried</text>
  <text start="2226.5" dur="6.74">funneling weapons into the paid</text>
  <text start="2229.35" dur="7.14">mercenaries they tried to have Assad</text>
  <text start="2233.24" dur="7.93">assassinated and all of this did not</text>
  <text start="2236.49" dur="8.07">work this is their last attempt they are</text>
  <text start="2241.17" dur="9.63">working out plans to move this forward</text>
  <text start="2244.56" dur="11.4">and what most likely will what most</text>
  <text start="2250.8" dur="8.67">likely will happen is that with all this</text>
  <text start="2255.96" dur="11.84">out there they need to provoke Syria or</text>
  <text start="2259.47" dur="13.47">Iran to fire and attack a warship or</text>
  <text start="2267.8" dur="8.74">have Israel let&amp;#39;s say shoot a torpedo at</text>
  <text start="2272.94" dur="6.37">the ship or have someone else a paid</text>
  <text start="2276.54" dur="5.41">mercenary to bomb one of the ships</text>
  <text start="2279.31" dur="8.85">somehow some way so they can blame this</text>
  <text start="2281.95" dur="9">on Syria and Iran to start the war so no</text>
  <text start="2288.16" dur="6.78">matter what happens at this point there</text>
  <text start="2290.95" dur="7.38">is only one path and one path only to</text>
  <text start="2294.94" dur="6.12">get this war started because they</text>
