  <text start="145.819" dur="4.441">going to be able to pay back there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="5.15">way that they&amp;#39;re going to spur the</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="6.3">industry to start growing out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="5.5">because all around them we see other</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="6.959">countries having the same exact problem</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.73">I mean France Spain Italy UK now Germany</text>
  <text start="163.519" dur="4.531">now</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="5.76">and it&amp;#39;s continually spreading and as</text>
  <text start="168.05" dur="3.96">time goes on we see it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.53">and worse yes the bankers tell us that</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="4.62">everything is fine they always tell us</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="3.57">it fine once they place a lot of debt on</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="2.73">a country and they say yet look see we</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="3.45">fixed the problem they have all this</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="4.74">money now they just owe it back to us</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="4.89">with interest but we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="184.1" dur="4.26">talk about that they just have enough</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.2">now to pay their bills and to go on</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="4.41">chugging along and most of the people</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="5.04">they pay off are the creditors and none</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="6.03">of it goes to the people and this shows</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="4.98">us that this system the way they</text>
  <text start="198.8" dur="5.97">designed it it doesn&amp;#39;t work at all and</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="6.45">it never will work I mean that United</text>
  <text start="204.77" dur="4.56">States is continually amassing more and</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="5.1">more dead every day I mean it&amp;#39;s doubled</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="4.62">since Obama took office and we know</text>
  <text start="212.21" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s the debt they&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a lot more of it over 200</text>
  <text start="216.83" dur="7.86">trillion and there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="219.92" dur="8.43">impossible for the US taxpayer to pay</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="6.48">all this back and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="6.12">right now is the economy is contracting</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s contracting everywhere not just in</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="4.17">one industry not just in retail but is</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="4.47">contracting and manufacturing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="6.54">contracting in real estate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.52" dur="5.7">contracting in employment we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="3.51">to see this coming from all angles at</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.14">this point and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="5.58">layoffs in the United States here itg</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="6.9">brands in Greensboro they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="254.27" dur="7.23">375 people in Canada Canada kimiko</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="4.41">laying off 500 Lockheed Martin 200</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="3.99">Jefferson Community and Technical</text>
  <text start="262.67" dur="9.14">College laying off 61 bone South</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="12.18">Carolina 200 people state of Connecticut</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="8.05">644 job layoff notices and we saw that</text>
  <text start="277.67" dur="4.82">Intel was laying off 12,000 people and</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="5.13">we go back in time we see a lot more</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.79">corporations are laying off and this is</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="6.18">continuing this is on going nonstop and</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="5.68">the government continually tries to</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="5.04">convince us that their recovery is</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="3.83">working and they convince us with</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="4.47">manipulated facts</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="5.53">but when we look at all these different</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="5.43">sectors like retail we look at housing</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="6.599">we look at the real unemployment we look</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="5.76">at GDP and we look through the illusion</text>
  <text start="309.919" dur="4.53">that they&amp;#39;re presenting to us we see a</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="4.53">completely different story and in the</text>
  <text start="314.449" dur="3.661">retail market they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="4.35">us that everything is fine sales are up</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="4.589">the reason why sales aren&amp;#39;t doing well</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.5">because it&amp;#39;s too sunny it&amp;#39;s too cloudy</text>
  <text start="322.699" dur="5.071">it&amp;#39;s snowing it&amp;#39;s raining they have one</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="7.32">excuse after another but when we really</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="6.899">look at this why would retail be falling</text>
  <text start="332.57" dur="3.42">apart why would it be contracting now a</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="4.231">lot of people say well everyone&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="5.04">online sales and that&amp;#39;s why but that</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t show that that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="5.1">happening here because you would see an</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="6">upsurge in online sales and most of the</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.159">companies they have both they have their</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="4.08">brick-and-mortar store and they have</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="3.931">online sales and actually they have the</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="3.48">best of both worlds you can order</text>
  <text start="355.22" dur="5.19">something online and pick it up the same</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="6.42">exact date in the store or you can have</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="6.379">it shipped free to the store and pick it</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="6.69">up later if they don&amp;#39;t have it in stock</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="6.701">so when you look at online sales is it</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="6.6">really outweighing what is happening in</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="6.239">the brick and mortar sector no it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="6.57">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="4.651">retail sector it is getting hammered now</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="3">of course there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="4.17">layoffs with me a lot of stores closing</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="4.86">but the funny thing is the way the US</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="3.66">government reports everything it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="2.46">really show up in the unemployment</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="3.84">numbers because if you have a part-time</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="5.25">job and you&amp;#39;re laid off and you work</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="3.96">under 25 hours or suttin a certain</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="3.81">number of hours and it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="400.01" dur="6.33">between each state they don&amp;#39;t count you</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="6.959">as being laid off on the other hand if</text>
  <text start="406.34" dur="6.03">you get that part time job you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="5.131">considered and having a full-time job if</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="5.1">you have two part-time jobs you have two</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="4.619">full-time jobs so you can see how they</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="3.24">manipulate these numbers now when we</text>
  <text start="419.419" dur="4.981">look at the retail market we see</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="7.139">aeropostale they have 800 teen clothing</text>

  <text start="443.289" dur="6.201">retailers that are going out of business</text>

  <text start="699.11" dur="7.65">all in decline and we see no improvement</text>
  <text start="702.41" dur="7.5">whatsoever right now according to a poll</text>
  <text start="706.76" dur="8.55">over a thousand american adults even</text>

  <text start="743.51" dur="7.47">right now and we see right now the</text>
  <text start="747.459" dur="5.681">reason why fewer Americans have their</text>

  <text start="759.279" dur="4.721">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about what is going</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="3.78">on here they realize the system is</text>
  <text start="764" dur="4.32">rigged but a lot of people know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.98" dur="4.049">wrong in the economy they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="768.32" dur="4.05">wrong in the government they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="770.029" dur="3.331">put their finger on it and we can see</text>
  <text start="772.37" dur="3.329">that people are getting more and more</text>
  <text start="773.36" dur="6.659">nervous tur saying okay I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="775.699" dur="6.211">rumors in my workplace layoffs are</text>

  <text start="784.13" dur="3.51">and they&amp;#39;re saying am I going to be next</text>
  <text start="785.329" dur="5.94">and people get very very nervous and</text>
  <text start="787.64" dur="5.79">scared about this and we see that people</text>
  <text start="791.269" dur="4.68">right now they&amp;#39;re saying okay something</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="4.86">is wrong in this government something is</text>
  <text start="795.949" dur="3.931">wrong with what&amp;#39;s going on here it makes</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.979">no sense whatsoever now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="799.88" dur="6.12">wake up and they start listening to</text>
  <text start="803.269" dur="4.26">people and they say okay now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="806" dur="4.41">starting to understand other people</text>
  <text start="807.529" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re just lost in trying to</text>
  <text start="810.41" dur="4.08">understand what is going on here and</text>
  <text start="812.06" dur="4.139">they never figure it out but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="814.49" dur="6.18">enough people right now that are waking</text>
  <text start="816.199" dur="9.061">up and they&amp;#39;re pushing back on the ttp</text>
  <text start="820.67" dur="6">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="825.26" dur="6.62">people are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="826.67" dur="5.21">this TTIP and the TPP</text>
  <text start="832.01" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s not for the everyday person so</text>
  <text start="835.46" dur="6.57">there are surveys out there which show</text>
  <text start="838.82" dur="6.21">that the TTIP in United States and</text>
  <text start="842.03" dur="7.98">Germany the support for it by the people</text>
  <text start="845.03" dur="9.32">is falling rapidly support for the</text>
  <text start="850.01" dur="7.86">transatlantic trade deal known as TTIP</text>
  <text start="854.35" dur="5.68">has fallen sharply in Germany and the</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="5.4">United States and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="860.03" dur="6.06">numbers you see that seventeen percent</text>
  <text start="863.27" dur="4.62">of Germans believe the transatlantic</text>
  <text start="866.09" dur="3.84">trade and investment partnership is a</text>
  <text start="867.89" dur="4.83">good thing down from fifty five percent</text>
  <text start="869.93" dur="5.39">two years ago the same thing in the</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="6.51">United States where the numbers are</text>
  <text start="875.32" dur="7.09">again very identical to Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="879.23" dur="5.22">numbers so it looks like people are</text>
  <text start="882.41" dur="4.59">pushing back saying okay this is not for</text>
  <text start="884.45" dur="7.17">the people and remember this whole</text>
  <text start="887" dur="6.84">entire TPP TTIP it is for corporations</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="4.8">at for the central bank its to make</text>
  <text start="893.84" dur="4.53">themselves very wealthy remember what</text>
  <text start="896.42" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="898.37" dur="4.74">very hard to do this is continually make</text>
  <text start="901.46" dur="4.67">the United States and many of the</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="6.81">private wasn&amp;#39;t central countries fascist</text>
  <text start="906.13" dur="6.25">dictatorships where government and</text>
  <text start="909.92" dur="5.82">corporations intertwined with each other</text>
  <text start="912.38" dur="6.42">and we can see as this economy</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="6.48">continually falters as things do not</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="5.22">improve they come down harder and harder</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="3.93">on the people and they try to pass more</text>
  <text start="924.02" dur="5.52">and more laws that benefit themselves</text>
  <text start="926.15" dur="6.45">and sometimes they don&amp;#39;t listen to the</text>
  <text start="929.54" dur="5.58">people and they pass them anyway they</text>
  <text start="932.6" dur="5.13">possibly can and this is when the people</text>
  <text start="935.12" dur="6.44">say enough is enough and we can see at</text>
  <text start="937.73" dur="7.56">this point as the economy continually</text>
  <text start="941.56" dur="5.59">rips itself apart the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="4.2">going to be more and more desperate in</text>
  <text start="947.15" dur="3.9">their actions and what they do in the</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="4.53">laws that they pass and we see it all</text>
  <text start="951.05" dur="5.28">across the world at this point the</text>
  <text start="954.02" dur="4.85">private central bank countries we see</text>
  <text start="956.33" dur="5.22">them passing a lot of draconian laws and</text>
  <text start="958.87" dur="5.08">we see that a lot of the wealthy they</text>
  <text start="961.55" dur="4.14">are protecting themselves government is</text>
  <text start="963.95" dur="3.78">protecting themselves</text>
