  <text start="84.83" dur="5.789">financial news now the central bankers</text>
  <text start="88.009" dur="6.241">the deep state certain swampy</text>
  <text start="90.619" dur="7.2">politicians they are now fighting for</text>
  <text start="94.25" dur="5.94">control of the economic narrative we</text>
  <text start="97.819" dur="4.83">know that Trump he is controlling the</text>
  <text start="100.19" dur="4.98">economic narrative but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="102.649" dur="7.14">him to have full and utter control</text>
  <text start="105.17" dur="6.869">because if that was the case they</text>
  <text start="109.789" dur="4.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to compete with him now</text>
  <text start="112.039" dur="5.58">we know that Trump wants the USMC a</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="6.631">signed what would this do this would</text>
  <text start="117.619" dur="6.06">create a lot of jobs it would reverse a</text>
  <text start="120.53" dur="7.589">lot of the NAFTA requirements within</text>
  <text start="123.679" dur="6.42">that law which did not help the American</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="5.821">people would actually move the jobs out</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="6.511">of the United States when the deep state</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="7.799">when the central bank when they create</text>
  <text start="136.61" dur="9.51">these laws it&amp;#39;s always the opposite of</text>
  <text start="141.739" dur="5.941">what they&amp;#39;re really intended for and if</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.839">you look at any of them the Patriot Act</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="4.529">the Affordable Care Act and you can go</text>
  <text start="149.959" dur="3.901">on and on and on it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="3.261">opposite yes they put a title on there</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="4.55">to make you think that</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="5.97">this is going to be great but within the</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="5.84">bill within the law it&amp;#39;s actually the</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="6.81">opposite the same goes with NAFTA NAFTA</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="7.3">moved out about 800 or so thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="5.67">out of this country it didn&amp;#39;t benefit</text>
  <text start="171.55" dur="4.92">the people of this country neither did</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="5.55">any of the other trade deals benefit the</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="5.31">people of this country now NAFTA was</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="5.37">tied up in Congress Trump wanted to get</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="6.81">rid of it completely but that was going</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="5.67">to be a challenge so he reworked it now</text>
  <text start="188.59" dur="3.81">I do believe this is the first phase I</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="4.32">think eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="192.4" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s gonna scrap the whole thing but he</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.07">needed to start somewhere he needed to</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="5.01">reverse a lot of what was in this bill</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="5.61">and bring the jobs back to the United</text>
  <text start="202.21" dur="5.94">States now we know the central bank the</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="3.3">deep state players they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="3.93">to happen</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.15">why this would give Trump strength I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="7.22">be talking about this in a little bit</text>
  <text start="213.96" dur="9.43">but first we can see that the brexit is</text>
  <text start="219.3" dur="5.56">going well for Boris Johnson even though</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="4.38">the mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="4.8">oh the BRICS it&amp;#39;s not going well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.77" dur="3.57">going to be delayed or this is gonna</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="3.12">happen that&amp;#39;s gonna happen I mean we</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.41">hear the same thing with Trump</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="6.12">remember the elite the establishment</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re not for Boris Johnson they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="5.07">not for the brexit so of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="7.29">called fear-mongering making everyone</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="7.29">doubt everything now the EU they will</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="5.25">not respond to Johnson&amp;#39;s alleged request</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="6.3">for an extension until Friday several</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="8.64">things are in play right now once again</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="9.54">any extension must be unanimous Jeremy</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="6.99">Corbyn met with Boris Johnson on an</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="6.3">election timetable and as you might</text>
  <text start="269.89" dur="5.81">expect he nothing was agreed upon if</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="6.75">there is an election I do believe that</text>
  <text start="275.7" dur="8.26">Boris Johnson will win it the key</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="8.759">concept is that a delay until January</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="8.599">solves nothing so why even do it in fact</text>
  <text start="288.909" dur="6.75">it increases the odds of a No Deal so</text>
  <text start="292.559" dur="7.78">those elite those in the EU who want to</text>
  <text start="295.659" dur="8.641">continually delay it actually helps Bors</text>
  <text start="300.339" dur="5.55">Johnson to approach a No Deal brexit now</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="3.75">of course what they&amp;#39;re gonna do is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="305.889" dur="3.42">gonna try to delay this forever I mean</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="5.22">they delayed it for three years already</text>
  <text start="309.309" dur="6.021">but instead of delaying it Johnson might</text>
  <text start="313.27" dur="5.459">just run down the clock</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="5.5">he might just sit back and say okay</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ll just run this down until I get</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="7.799">what I want</text>
  <text start="321.909" dur="10.201">and I believe he is maneuvering into a</text>
  <text start="328.629" dur="6.99">certain position to get what he wants</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="6.089">and it seems like it is playing out to</text>
  <text start="335.619" dur="3.81">his benefit now here in the United</text>
  <text start="338.199" dur="5.041">States just like we said in the</text>
  <text start="339.429" dur="6.811">beginning Trump wants the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="5.639">passed Pino Navarro he was discussing</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="5.609">this on TV and he says that Nancy needs</text>
  <text start="348.879" dur="5.97">to ratify this Trump remember tweeted</text>
  <text start="351.849" dur="5.43">out the following can&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="5.85">nervous Nancy Pelosi isn&amp;#39;t moving faster</text>
  <text start="357.279" dur="5.16">on us MCA her people want it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="4.64">know they don&amp;#39;t know why she isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.439" dur="8.19">putting it up for a bipartisan vote</text>
  <text start="365.339" dur="10.6">taking too long well remember Nancy</text>
  <text start="370.629" dur="9.29">Pelosi entered an agreement with Justin</text>
  <text start="375.939" dur="8.46">Trudeau to stall the USMC a passage</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="6.79">Trudeau&amp;#39;s government agreed not to call</text>
  <text start="384.399" dur="5.04">the u.s. MCA up for a vote in the</text>
  <text start="386.709" dur="4.531">Canadian Parliament Pelosi was waiting</text>
  <text start="389.439" dur="5.49">to see if Trudeau would win the</text>
  <text start="391.24" dur="7.199">re-election which he did with Canada</text>
  <text start="394.929" dur="6.181">re-electing Trudeau it paves the way for</text>
  <text start="398.439" dur="5.31">Pelosi to announce the labor provisions</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.579">are not strong enough within the USMC a</text>
  <text start="403.749" dur="4.53">deal discussions with the Trump</text>
  <text start="406.689" dur="3.93">administration are not resolving the</text>
  <text start="408.279" dur="5.19">issue the US workers are not protecting</text>
  <text start="410.619" dur="5.61">protected enough and she is going to</text>
  <text start="413.469" dur="5.82">table the vote that is what she would</text>
  <text start="416.229" dur="6">like to do and then she&amp;#39;ll wait until</text>
  <text start="419.289" dur="3.361">after the 2020 election why would she</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="4.53">want</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="7.44">do this it helps the American person it</text>
  <text start="426.759" dur="5.91">creates more jobs more jobs that means</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="4.169">that people will be able to live their</text>
  <text start="432.669" dur="4.021">lives if they&amp;#39;re living their lives</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;ll have money to spend if they have</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="3.78">money to spend</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="9.569">retail does better why doesn&amp;#39;t she want</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="11.43">this because she rather wait until after</text>
  <text start="447.039" dur="6.571">the 2020 election because if she passes</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="8.04">this and they take a vote on it and it</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="8.779">passes it will boost the US economy we</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="6.3">would see more growth in the economy</text>
  <text start="462.389" dur="7.06">this is not what she wants we would see</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="6.929">more people getting jobs this is not</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="7.051">what she wants and Trump would control</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="4.981">the economic narrative because as you</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="3">know he would come out and say the USMC</text>
  <text start="478.15" dur="3.81">what a was past</text>
  <text start="479.5" dur="5.43">look what had his look what it has done</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="6.3">and he would show the statistics from</text>
  <text start="484.93" dur="7.44">NAFTA to the USMC a showing how many</text>
  <text start="488.26" dur="6.6">people got jobs how much better the</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="5.1">economy is doing that remember what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="5.67">doing right now is in preparation for</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="5.46">the transition he also wants this pass</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="5.73">because he wants to use this for</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="5.58">re-election Pelosi doesn&amp;#39;t want him to</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="6.32">use this so who is this really hurting</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="7.94">it&amp;#39;s hurting the American person and</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="7.32">this is her plan but we need to remember</text>
  <text start="516.45" dur="6.94">Trudeau lost his majority in government</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="7.84">when voters reduced his liberals party</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="7.08">from 177 seats down to 157 so he has to</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="6.21">team up with another party so he was</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="6.27">weakened and I do believe that the</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="6.87">Patriots plan is going to be very very</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="7.8">different than Pelosi&amp;#39;s plan Trump will</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="6.69">announce his plan very soon and he will</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="6.39">show everyone here in the United States</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="6.81">how he&amp;#39;s going to convince Canada to say</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="6.87">the deal is good to say that yeah</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="7.59">we want this remember Trump has leverage</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="7.229">he used it with Mexico he partly used it</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="6.15">with Canada he&amp;#39;s not afraid to use</text>
  <text start="565.029" dur="6.331">leverage to get what he wants and he</text>
  <text start="568.06" dur="4.13">will push Trudeau into doing what he</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="4.62">wants</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="7.03">remember the Patriots they have the</text>
  <text start="575.98" dur="8.159">strength behind them the strength of an</text>
  <text start="579.22" dur="7.83">economic force and Pelosi she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="584.139" dur="7.171">have this she has nothing right now and</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="6.779">does Trudeau want to look bad in front</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="7.86">of his people no he does not</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="8.841">and I do believe the Patriots have the</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="7.08">edge on this and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="6.94">Trump is trying to get as much done as</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="6.42">possible he&amp;#39;s been in office almost</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="5.25">three years and look what he has</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="5.669">accomplished with bringing jobs back</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="5.43">bringing manufacturers back and you know</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="4.951">people are saying well that&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="6.75">well the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;ve had how many years to move all</text>
  <text start="627.04" dur="5.13">the jobs of manufacturing out of this</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="8.25">country he&amp;#39;s doing this in three short</text>
  <text start="632.17" dur="8.849">years the system and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="6.36">the central bank system is imploding it</text>
  <text start="641.019" dur="6">would be great if he had 15 years but he</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="6.63">doesn&amp;#39;t this is why he is working so</text>
  <text start="647.019" dur="5.971">quickly to get it done this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.35" dur="5.07">using tariffs this is why he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="652.99" dur="6.649">so hard and you&amp;#39;re gonna see him push</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="9.18">even harder in 2020 because I do believe</text>
  <text start="659.639" dur="7.45">between 2020 and 2024 this is when the</text>
  <text start="664.6" dur="4.53">transition is going to happen and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.089" dur="4.23">gonna see everything accelerate like</text>
  <text start="669.13" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="671.319" dur="4.741">to worry about re-election he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.47" dur="3.51">have to worry about anything else</text>
  <text start="676.06" dur="6">all these other blocks will be</text>
  <text start="677.98" dur="6.15">completely gone and the only block that</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="3.719">would be left would be the central bank</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="3.54">system and I think this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="5.611">removing everything else first</text>
  <text start="687.67" dur="5.85">so the target becomes very very clear</text>
  <text start="691.39" dur="5.91">and what the Patriots are gonna go after</text>
  <text start="693.52" dur="6.68">and that is the central bank system that</text>
  <text start="697.3" dur="6.99">is the prize because without</text>
  <text start="700.2" dur="7.33">restructuring controlling it the system</text>
  <text start="704.29" dur="7.23">will not change the system will say</text>
  <text start="707.53" dur="7.38">exactly the same Trump knows this the</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="7.53">Patriots know this and this is why they</text>
  <text start="714.91" dur="6.84">are pushing all of their plans very very</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="5.34">hard at an accelerated rate they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="6.42">have much time to do this they have to</text>
  <text start="724.39" dur="5.7">undo everything the deep state the</text>
  <text start="728.17" dur="5.04">central bank has been doing for many</text>
  <text start="730.09" dur="5.34">many years and you can see that the</text>
  <text start="733.21" dur="5.55">leaders around the world Christine</text>
  <text start="735.43" dur="5.01">Lagarde&amp;#39;s essential bankers well they</text>
  <text start="738.76" dur="5.1">know exactly what&amp;#39;s happening here and</text>
