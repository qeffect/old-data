  <text start="33.51" dur="6.93">episode 1901 and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="5.61">24th 2019 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="4.77">the new economy was just announced did</text>
  <text start="42.9" dur="5.82">Jack catch it let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="6.029">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="48.72" dur="5.43">know that Trump and the Patriots their</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="6.241">ultimate plan when everything is said</text>
  <text start="54.15" dur="7.38">and done is to transition us into a</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="7.4">completely new economy and we are</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="5.339">starting to see how this is all coming</text>
  <text start="64.88" dur="3.82">together right now</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="4.231">and when we look at what Trump of the</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="5.88">Patriots are doing we can see that every</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="7.26">piece they move they&amp;#39;re recreating a</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="5.899">brand new economy for the people and</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="4.59">this is going to spread around the world</text>
  <text start="80.479" dur="5.381">now we know that Trump has been using</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="7.44">tariffs we know that he wants to get rid</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="8.849">of the Fed and he just told the American</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="8.13">people exactly what we need to do and</text>
  <text start="94.709" dur="7.531">how we need to get there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="6.84">starting the dismantling process of the</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="5.28">old system so he can usher in the new</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="4.11">system now before we get to that I want</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="4.56">to talk about Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs right now</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="5.489">Trump&amp;#39;s steel tariffs that are in place</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="5.819">right now they are being challenged and</text>
  <text start="114.959" dur="5.461">the Supreme Court has rejected the early</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.2">challenge to trump steel tariffs so</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="3.869">right now the Supreme Court is saying</text>
  <text start="122.099" dur="4.621">yeah we&amp;#39;re rejecting this at this point</text>
  <text start="124.289" dur="4.651">those importers are arguing that Trump</text>
  <text start="126.72" dur="3.899">does not have the unbounded authority</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="4.29">under the Constitution to regulate trade</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="5.671">they saying that this job belongs to</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="5.58">Congress and right now of course the</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="4.74">legal challenges in its early stages the</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="4.289">Supreme Court is already rejecting it</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out but</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="6.03">it seems like Trump is keeping the steel</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="6.09">tariffs right in place now very</text>
  <text start="149.129" dur="5.25">interestingly we know that she and Trump</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna be meeting at the g20</text>
  <text start="154.379" dur="5.131">they&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about this new</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="6">trade deal and it seems like G right now</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="3.04">and Trump they are going to be coming</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="2.86">together</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;re eventually going to make</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="6.36">this deal now very interestingly kim</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="5.55">jeong-hoon is reporting that he received</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="5.19">a letter from trump now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="173.5" dur="4.53">picture of kim jeong-hoon he&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="3.93">white shirt he&amp;#39;s reading a letter of</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="3.54">course we know that they&amp;#39;re gonna say oh</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="3.54">we found out what this letter says</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="5.58">because they&amp;#39;re gonna use some type of</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="5.31">high-tech device to reverse the image on</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="3.63">this letter because you kind of can see</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="6.72">through it and they&amp;#39;ll tell us what it</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="6.93">says but we probably already know what</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="3.57">this is all about and we&amp;#39;ll discuss that</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="4.26">in just a minute but let&amp;#39;s go back a</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="5.4">little bit we know that chairman G he</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="4.05">visited North Korea we know that he</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="4.86">spoke to Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="206.02" dur="5.97">we know that chairman G and president</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="7.14">moon jae-in of South Korea they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="211.99" dur="5.93">to be meeting at the g20 meeting G he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.58" dur="4.53">going to be playing the role of</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="6.01">denuclearizing North Korea and using</text>
  <text start="221.11" dur="5.57">moon jae-in as optics of peace with</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="5.55">chairman kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.68">chairman g will then meet trump for</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="5.729">expanded talks at the g20 chairman ji</text>
  <text start="232.36" dur="5.55">will offer president trump peace and a</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="6.961">denuclearized North Korea and this is</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="7.049">exactly what Trump wants Trump we found</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="6.48">out that he&amp;#39;s going to be meeting moon</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="4.861">jae-in after the g20 in South Korea so</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="4.62">Trump is gonna be traveling to South</text>
  <text start="249.82" dur="4.86">Korea probably to finalize all of this</text>
  <text start="253.27" dur="4.95">and speak to him to make it look like</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="7.85">moon jae-in was the person that was</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="6.75">handling the peace talks so moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="5.26">will fill in the details of the</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="5.01">denuclearize North Korea to trump this</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="3.84">power play will not work with Trump he</text>
  <text start="269.98" dur="3.9">has been talking with Kim via letters</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.74">and most likely this letter most likely</text>
  <text start="273.88" dur="4.62">as telling Kim Congrats you are less</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.56">captive and you have incredible</text>
  <text start="278.5" dur="5.03">opportunities ahead of you remember what</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="5.46">Trump has tweeted out in the past</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.36">anything in this very interesting world</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="2.22">is possible but I believe that Kim</text>
  <text start="287.89" dur="3.12">jong-un</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="4.38">fully realizes the great economic</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="4.26">potential of North Korea and will do</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="3.19">nothing to interfere or end it he also</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="2.59">knows</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="4.29">that I am with him and does not want to</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="6.39">break his promise to me deal will happen</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="6.87">this was back in May 4th 2019 now Trump</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="5.97">has now maneuvered everything into place</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="5.09">the trade deal between G and Trump can</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="7.56">move forward Trump G will come to an</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="7.329">understanding and G will save face Trump</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="4.56">and the Patriots are now moving at</text>
  <text start="319.759" dur="6.151">lightning speed on preparing the new</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="4.77">economy so Trump has just set up all of</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="4.08">this he&amp;#39;s going to get the</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="7.29">denuclearization in North Korea he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="6.51">gonna make a deal with Xi Jingping moon</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="5.16">jae-in is gonna look like he&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="6">that kind of took care of the whole</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="6.21">denuclearization of North Korea and now</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="5.72">Trump is going to make the deal once the</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="5.13">deal is made a couple of months later</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="4.99">tariffs are going to be reduced or</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="3.57">dropped which is going to be difficult</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="3.66">for the central bank&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="5.61">been using tariffs to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="356.87" dur="5.28">this is why the world is slowing but</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="5.01">when China and the United States make a</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="7.41">trade deal and the trade is better than</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="7.799">before and it&amp;#39;s incredible and there are</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="6.27">no tariffs guess what the central bank</text>
  <text start="372.889" dur="6.75">is in trouble now Trump announced a</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="6.329">couple of things number one he announced</text>
  <text start="379.639" dur="5.011">the dismantling of the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="382.159" dur="4.171">system now of course he didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="3.449">in so many words hitting crime say hey</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="3.42">by the way central bank&amp;#39;s by the way</text>
  <text start="388.099" dur="4.171">deep state I&amp;#39;m getting rid of your</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="5.669">petrol dollar system what he did tweet</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="4.829">out is the following China gets 91</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="4.111">percent of its oil from the straight</text>
  <text start="397.099" dur="4.741">Japan 62 percent and many other</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="4.41">countries likewise so why are we</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="5.699">protecting the shipping lanes for other</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="5.37">countries for zero compensation all of</text>
  <text start="407.539" dur="4.261">these countries should be protecting</text>
  <text start="409.31" dur="4.889">their own ships on what has always been</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="4.799">a dangerous journey we don&amp;#39;t even need</text>
  <text start="414.199" dur="4.56">to be there in that the US has just</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="5.401">become by far the largest producer of</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="5.52">energy anywhere in the world the u.s.</text>
  <text start="422" dur="3.96">request for Iran is very simple no</text>
  <text start="424.279" dur="4.501">nuclear weapons and no further</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="6.38">sponsoring of terror</text>
  <text start="428.78" dur="7.16">what Trump is really doing here he is</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="8.52">explaining to the world the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="7.87">system is done remember back prior to 71</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="5.35">what was the deal in the Middle East we</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="5.18">will protect all of these countries we</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="6.48">will protect the oil with the military</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="8.05">Trump has already signaled we are no</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="4.92">longer going to be doing this why think</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="3.83">about it</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="7.47">we don&amp;#39;t need to protect the oil anymore</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="7.93">we won&amp;#39;t be using it anymore to back the</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="5.46">new currency if the currency is no</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="4.41">longer back by the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="470.54" dur="5.04">the deal made with the Middle East does</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="5.01">not need to be upheld anymore we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="6.18">need to keep forces there it would make</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="5.76">no sense whatsoever the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="6.18">just announced the dismantling of the</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="4.97">petro dollar system now right on</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="5.46">schedule</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="8.05">Trump came out and he went after the</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="6.87">central bank system and this is going to</text>
  <text start="497" dur="6.06">build over time he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="500.27" dur="4.47">following despite a Federal Reserve that</text>
  <text start="503.06" dur="3.39">doesn&amp;#39;t know what it is doing raise</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="3.27">rates far too fast very low inflation</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="4.35">other parts of the world slowing</text>

  <text start="513.53" dur="5.309">course to have one of the best months of</text>
  <text start="515.089" dur="6.061">June in US history think of it think of</text>
  <text start="518.839" dur="3.441">what it could have been if the Fed had</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="3.51">gotten it right</text>
  <text start="522.28" dur="6.1">thousands of points higher on the Dow</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="6.48">and GDP in the fours or fives now they</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="5.13">stick like a stubborn child when we need</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="4.59">rates cut and easing to make up for what</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="3.45">other countries are doing against us</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="4.29">blew it</text>
