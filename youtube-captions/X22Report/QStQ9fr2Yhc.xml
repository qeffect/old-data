  <text start="103.71" dur="5.82">geopolitical news now during the</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="4.71">Catalonian referendum there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="4.92">propaganda out there where the corporate</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="5.459">media spain their cyber intelligence</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="4.979">organizations they were saying that</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="5.491">Russia was cyber attacking and spreading</text>
  <text start="119.429" dur="4.291">disinformation in Catalonia and they</text>
  <text start="122.22" dur="3.959">were playing that up really really big</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="4.62">to make it seem like yeah the people</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="4.14">really don&amp;#39;t want to separate from Spain</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.77">and its really Russia spreading</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="5.42">disinformation we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="5.67">the that Spain&amp;#39;s cyber intelligence</text>
  <text start="135.739" dur="5.531">organization their unit they announced</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.709">that well we can&amp;#39;t find any evidence</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="4.14">whatsoever that it was Russia we kind of</text>
  <text start="143.489" dur="5.421">just made it up to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s why the people were voting for a</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="5.65">separation between Spain and Catalonia</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="6.18">and we can see that they continually use</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="5.52">this propaganda to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="4.83">that things are things are happening</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="5.43">when they&amp;#39;re really not and once again</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="6.45">it was complete was pure propaganda now</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.82">again what was the fake news because you</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="3.75">could see the corporate media was out</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="4.23">there saying that Russia was cyber</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="5.31">attacking and other different news</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="4.2">organizations were saying no there was</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.66">no cyber attack there&amp;#39;s no evidence of</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="3.18">it but of course who were they going to</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="3.18">believe well they&amp;#39;re gonna believe the</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="3.42">corporate media and not the alternative</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="2.28">media and this is a big problem because</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="2.28">later on</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="3.06">they do is they come out and they say</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="4.92">yeah there was no evidence whatsoever</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.58">and all that all that they told you</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="5.46">where it&amp;#39;s completely wrong we see right</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.61">now that everything is now pivoting over</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="5.27">to Russia we talked about Egypt we</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="5.7">talked about Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran and</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="5.43">many other countries where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207" dur="6.75">looking at Russia China and now the</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="5.95">Saudi King Salman he has stressed the</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="3.78">importance of further coordinating their</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.56">actions on the energy markets and of</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="5.34">course this has to do with their natural</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="5.04">resources oil and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="4.65">that Saudi they are slowly making their</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="4.65">move away from the dollar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.52" dur="4.41">playing both sides right now and we see</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="5.67">that the Cabal they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="7.38">any type of an event anywhere to try to</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="6.81">save their entire system which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="5.79">been creating for a very long time we</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="4.47">know out in Ukraine they had a coup out</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="3.96">there regime change we know Victoria</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="3.66">Nuland was part of it the United States</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.11">paid about five should say the Cabal</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.41">paid about five billion dollars to have</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="3.93">this we come to learn that the snipers</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="4.26">were hired they were instructed to fire</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="3.69">on the people and the police make it</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="3.54">look like it was coming from the</text>
  <text start="260.79" dur="4.44">government at the time when it really</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="5.4">was it wasn&amp;#39;t and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="4.35">things are heating up once again in</text>
  <text start="268.14" dur="4.02">Ukraine right now the government</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="5.37">building areas of the capital gums which</text>
  <text start="272.16" dur="4.86">is the southeastern part of Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="4.35">currently being blocked by people in</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="4.56">military uniform now is this going to be</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="3.69">a coup is something going to happen well</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see because we</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="3.27">sees things are starting to move in that</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.83">way we see the saudi-led military</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="7.47">coalition fighting the people in Yemen</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="7.14">well they agreed to allow humanitarian</text>
  <text start="293.73" dur="5.1">aid into Yemen and this was because we</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="4.98">can see there were war crime charges</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="5.01">going to be brought against the US is</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="5.28">going to be brought against Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="4.23">and Russia China and the rest were out</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="2.73">there saying listen there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="4.56">humanitarian crisis going on right now</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="5.91">you need to let humanitarian aid into</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="4.83">Yemen and the push there is to force the</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="3.66">people into doing something they really</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="2.38">don&amp;#39;t want to do and that&amp;#39;s taking on a</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="2.229">puppet</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="3.78">government so Saudi Arabia the United</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="3.601">States I should say the Cabal could have</text>
  <text start="323.62" dur="4.92">control of the natural resources in</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="5.82">Yemen but again that fight isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="328.54" dur="4.53">too well we see the Iraqi forces they</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="3.48">have started their operations to clear</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="4.8">the remaining the Islamic state hell</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="6.409">borders with it near the Syrian</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="6.72">territory and it looks like it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="340.979" dur="6.19">done here where Syria Iraq they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="5.94">be completely cleared of the paid</text>
  <text start="347.169" dur="4.951">mercenaries now you know the US media</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="3.84">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="5.64">that the American troops will stay in</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="5.94">Syria to aid the Kurdish insurgents now</text>
  <text start="357.76" dur="5.159">again the corporate media is controlled</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="5.88">by the Cabal they use the corporate</text>
  <text start="362.919" dur="4.591">media to spread their message to say you</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="3.84">know the United States is going to stay</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="6.12">in there we&amp;#39;re not moving we support the</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="7.41">Kurdish people and we come to find out</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="7.52">once again that this isn&amp;#39;t true now</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="8.37">Trump he&amp;#39;s been speaking to them one and</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="7.48">he&amp;#39;s told rwan that the US will no</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="7.14">longer fund the pro-kurdish people</text>
  <text start="388.63" dur="6.599">protection units YPG and we can see at</text>
  <text start="392.95" dur="6">this point the u.s. is not spending any</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="7.671">money on the armies of the Kurds we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="7.86">not supporting the YPG and the US</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="7.48">doesn&amp;#39;t need to be in this area so the</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="5.4">Cabal is going to have a major problem</text>
  <text start="410.38" dur="5.849">with this because this is what they were</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="7.23">going to use to try to separate Syria</text>
  <text start="416.229" dur="6.271">and at this point it&amp;#39;s not happening and</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="6.39">we see right now that Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="4.59">they are moving into Syria further and</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="2.94">further cleaning out the paid</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="3.87">mercenaries pretty much they have about</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="4.68">to the paid mercenaries which I mean is</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="5.459">the Islamic state they have about 2% of</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="5.16">the land there and in a matter of a week</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="4.231">or two it&amp;#39;s going to be completely free</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="4.619">and clear and now the u.s. is not</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="4.98">supporting the Kurds monetarily and</text>
  <text start="443.229" dur="4.761">which means that there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="5.25">separation and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="4.27">Russia and Syria Iraq in the other</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="2.49">countries they&amp;#39;re not going to allow</text>
  <text start="452.26" dur="4.11">this to happen anyway so</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="5.13">the cabal&amp;#39;s dream of holding on to syria</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="6.65">is coming to an end but we do need to</text>
  <text start="458.5" dur="7.74">remember that Israel Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="5.619">they&amp;#39;re pushing something in Lebanon to</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="4.29">maybe move into Syria and Iran now we</text>
  <text start="468.639" dur="4.56">have a lot of this going on right now we</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="6.48">see the end of the paid mercenaries in</text>
  <text start="473.199" dur="5.101">in Syria but we see a build-up for a new</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="2.79">event so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="4.86">very carefully but Russia is moving</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="5.73">ahead and they&amp;#39;re saying that the expert</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="4.259">body on Syrian chemical attacks is</text>
  <text start="485.53" dur="5.82">completely dead now this is the body</text>
  <text start="487.419" dur="6.571">that the u.s. used to have no</text>
  <text start="491.35" dur="4.74">investigation whatsoever on the chemical</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="3.69">attacks in Syria they just allowed you</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="2.88">know the militants to report what</text>
  <text start="497.68" dur="3.54">happened there and they use that</text>
  <text start="498.97" dur="4.59">information to create their report to</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="4.89">say yes Assad used chemical weapons when</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="6.6">it really didn&amp;#39;t happen now Moscow</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="7.41">saying that group is dead where we need</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="6.689">to create a new mechanism inside of</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="6.63">Syria to actually investigate what goes</text>
  <text start="516.849" dur="5.701">on and this is another hit against the</text>
  <text start="520.15" dur="4.74">Cabal and Lavrov is out there saying</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="4.95">listen we also need to implement UN</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="3.9">resolution on Syria and he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="527.5" dur="4.38">about the United Nations Security</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="7.29">Council resolution to 254 on the Syrian</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="7.02">settlement so right now Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="4.86">are moving forward and this is all about</text>
  <text start="538.9" dur="5.129">getting the Cabal completely out of</text>
  <text start="540.94" dur="6.69">Syria shutting them down now Seymour</text>
  <text start="544.029" dur="6.421">Hersh is out there and he is a respected</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="4.709">investigative journalist and he is out</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="4.74">there and he says he has information on</text>
  <text start="552.339" dur="5.581">this he&amp;#39;s claiming that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="5.28">sold nerve gas to Syrian terrorists</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="4.53">while she was acting as Secretary of</text>
  <text start="560.47" dur="4.68">State now this is what he claims that</text>
  <text start="562.45" dur="5.25">the Obama administration falsely blamed</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="4.41">the government of Assad for the sarin</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="4.86">gas attack which they were hoping to use</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="5.219">as an excuse to invade Syria which later</text>
  <text start="572.56" dur="4.05">on they kind of did he also claims that</text>
  <text start="574.779" dur="3.151">the Obama administration assisted in</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="5.9">approving the transfer of deadly</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="7.56">chemical weapons from Libya to Syria and</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="4.69">by the terms of the agreement funding</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="3.69">came from Turkey as we</text>
  <text start="587.2" dur="4.92">you know as well as Saudi Arabia Qatar</text>
  <text start="589.18" dur="5.61">as we know that this is what actually</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="5.94">happened now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="8.91">about this is that with the support of</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="10.35">mi6 well it looks like they took the gas</text>
  <text start="603.7" dur="8.73">from Gaddafi&amp;#39;s Arsenal&amp;#39;s and moved it</text>
  <text start="608.41" dur="6.6">into Syria and this is how they were</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="4.8">able to give the paid mercenaries the</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="5.37">Islamic state al-qaeda the moderate</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="6.96">rebels this sarin gas this is where they</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="6.09">got it this is what they used to gas</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="4.68">certain villages and they used it to</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="4.74">blame it back on Assad now once again we</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="4.41">talked about the reasoning the corporate</text>
  <text start="631.21" dur="6.03">media the intelligent agencies were</text>
  <text start="633.28" dur="5.79">using to say yes Assad used it on his</text>
  <text start="637.24" dur="3.36">own people and we looked at the</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="4.23">situation and said okay the people</text>
  <text start="640.6" dur="4.53">supported him the people elected him the</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="4.65">refugees are coming back into the</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="5.58">country after he cleared out the paid</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="5.1">mercenaries millions of people why would</text>
  <text start="650.71" dur="4.8">he gas his own people he has the support</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="5.16">of the people he brought in Russia it</text>
  <text start="655.51" dur="5.01">makes no sense and once again that</text>
  <text start="658.21" dur="4.26">entire argument is completely falling</text>
  <text start="660.52" dur="4.35">apart because it never made any sense</text>
  <text start="662.47" dur="5.28">but again they&amp;#39;re trying to push an</text>
  <text start="664.87" dur="4.95">event and we see the Saudi Crown Prince</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="4.35">Mohammed bin Salman is out there</text>
  <text start="669.82" dur="5.07">claiming that the Iranian Ayatollah is</text>
