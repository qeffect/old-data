  <text start="107.25" dur="5.039">maybe that&amp;#39;s why business confidence is</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.729">down at this point now in the UK the</text>
  <text start="112.289" dur="4.521">Royal Mail announced that they&amp;#39;re going</text>

  <text start="137.099" dur="6.061">and again this is due to the</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="6.12">onna me this is why businesses start to</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="5.7">lay off to close to shrink and we can</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="4.37">see this happening all over the world at</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="5.36">this time now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="151.34" dur="5.86">again all eyes on the stock market</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="5.56">consumer confidence jumps to six-year</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.77">high I mean the people are saying the</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.1">Fed tapering the stock market is at</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="7.38">all-time highs consumers have not been</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="6.87">this exuberant since january of 2008 and</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="5.61">that should make every single person</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="5.91">worried because what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="174.96" dur="4.11">well in january-february the Fed was out</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="3.6">there saying that they are not</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="4.5">forecasting a recession and we had a</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="4.77">recession they told us the subprime was</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="5.04">contained and we had a surprise we had a</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="4.89">subprime securities problem real estate</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="5.25">went down the tubes retail went down the</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.61">tubes American people lost thirty-eight</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="7.11">percent of their wealth so right what</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="7.17">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now are our people</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.65">looking at the stock market believing</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="4.14">the government that we are in a recovery</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="4.59">the housing markets bouncing back</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="3.84">retails bouncing back unemployment is</text>
  <text start="210.21" dur="3.54">that six point seven percent the</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="3.78">president&amp;#39;s out there saying we need to</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="3.57">create more jobs like we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="4.8">to bring this unemployment down and give</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.64">everyone jobs but again this is an</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="6.51">illusion it&amp;#39;s a complete illusion just</text>
  <text start="222.96" dur="7.44">like it was in 2008 now the USDA is</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="5.79">expecting food prices to go up now I</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t know about you I&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="3.78">food prices go up I&amp;#39;ve been seeing it on</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="3.15">milk I&amp;#39;ve been singing on coffee I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="3.51">been seeing it on meat I&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="5.04">it in wine I&amp;#39;ve been seeing it every</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;ve been seeing products shrink to keep</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="4.14">the prices the same but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="6.27">that from their various measures of you</text>
  <text start="247.11" dur="7.8">us food prices we expect the food prices</text>
  <text start="250.83" dur="7.44">to rise around 3.5 percent in 2014 since</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="6.27">in 2013 food really didn&amp;#39;t go up at all</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="5.1">I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve been seeing it go up</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="4.59">and i&amp;#39;m sure you have to I track it on</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.53">the x 22 report com site and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="5.04">seeing prices go up they stayed level</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="6.3">but products shrink so the prices can</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="5.31">stay the same now walmart is having a</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="4.68">problems with their sales and of course</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="3.93">they blamed it on in 2013 in the</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="4.23">beginning of the year they blamed it on</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="4.62">the tax returns because their people</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="2.91">weren&amp;#39;t getting their tax returns then</text>
  <text start="284.67" dur="4.77">they blamed it on the Food Stamp</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.97">production again this is due to the</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="4.86">economy people don&amp;#39;t have the money to</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.23">go out and just buy things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="4.5">have the disposable income they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="4.14">have the employment but they believe and</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="4.83">they believe their own propaganda</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="5.22">probably that the economy is recovering</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="3.6">and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing poorly</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="3.81">is because of food stamps and if there</text>
  <text start="307.23" dur="4.92">are entire businesses based on the poor</text>
  <text start="309.39" dur="4.53">with food stamp or people who are put in</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="3.36">a position where they needed to get food</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="3.51">stamp but they&amp;#39;re no longer receiving</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="4.02">the same amount and this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="3.9">poor business model but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="5.37">to bounce back and change their</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="6.3">marketing by going after grocery sales</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="5.1">online and Walmart&amp;#39;s going to launch an</text>
  <text start="327.63" dur="4.05">online tool called savings catcher which</text>
  <text start="330" dur="3.63">allows consumers to compare walmart</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="4.89">prices on groceries with those of</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="4.77">competing local supermarkets and again</text>
  <text start="336.57" dur="3.84">this is how they&amp;#39;re building up their</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="3.84">business because they realize everybody</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="4.5">needs food and they&amp;#39;re trying to give</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="5.1">food away at cheap prices and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="3.81">trying to bring more people into walmart</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="5.1">and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="6.06">this now we know retail is declining we</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="4.68">see that we see stores closing all over</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="4.71">the place this is not a surprise to</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="5.07">anyone the holiday season was a disaster</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="4.26">most of most Americans went into this</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="5.64">they used up whatever they had on their</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="5.82">credit cards and that declined credit</text>
  <text start="367.83" dur="3">card usage declined during the holiday</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="2.76">season then they went into their savings</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="3.93">and pulled out money out of the savings</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="4.65">just to kind of have a happy holiday</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="4.59">season but after that we saw a stores</text>
  <text start="376.98" dur="3.99">start to close because again they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.35" dur="3.84">have the sales because people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="5.22">have the money walgreens right now is</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="5.31">going to close 76 unprofitable stores</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="4.5">walgren says its fiscal second-quarter</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="3.81">earnings slipped from last year well of</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="6.42">course they did because unemployment</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="7.11">came down since 20 2012 and this is why</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;re doing worse I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="3.75">even make sense unemployment in 2012 was</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.38">hovering around eight percent</text>
  <text start="403.17" dur="4.62">unemployment in 2013 was six point six</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="4.86">percent</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="6.96">stores be doing better but again it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="411.48" dur="5.49">illusion it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="4.32">and this is why you&amp;#39;re seeing all this</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="5.22">happened now in the housing market again</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="6.93">we have to remember back in 2013 Wells</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="6.66">Fargo Bank of America Citibank JP Morgan</text>

  <text start="432.9" dur="5.49">mortgage companies are closing all over</text>
  <text start="435.69" dur="5.31">the country why because people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.39" dur="5.57">taking out mortgages why because we had</text>
  <text start="441" dur="6.24">that huge problem in 2008 where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="5.17">millions of foreclosures people lost</text>

  <text start="756.019" dur="5.91">remember Common Core was not developed</text>
  <text start="757.519" dur="8.55">by educators it was developed by hmm we</text>
  <text start="761.929" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t exactly know who they are but they</text>
  <text start="766.069" dur="4.32">have nothing to do with education they</text>

  <text start="789.41" dur="6.51">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now now</text>
  <text start="793.129" dur="4.74">everyone knows I am NOT for Obamacare</text>
  <text start="795.92" dur="3.99">whatsoever I believe it&amp;#39;s a cash grab I</text>
  <text start="797.869" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t believe it benefits the American</text>
  <text start="799.91" dur="4.229">people and how do we know this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.829" dur="5.07">because they had to put penalties on</text>
  <text start="804.139" dur="4.451">Obamacare they had to intertwine taxes</text>
  <text start="806.899" dur="4.001">into Obamacare and I</text>
  <text start="808.59" dur="5.58">see our fearless leaders sit down at a</text>
  <text start="810.9" dur="4.59">computer and get Obamacare or the</text>
  <text start="814.17" dur="3.33">Affordable Care Act which is the</text>
  <text start="815.49" dur="4.35">official name they didn&amp;#39;t do this why</text>
  <text start="817.5" dur="6.09">because they know it&amp;#39;s terrible the</text>
  <text start="819.84" dur="6.33">president kept his health insurance from</text>
  <text start="823.59" dur="5.73">the government he didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="826.17" dur="5.64">Affordable Care Act at all because he</text>
  <text start="829.32" dur="4.62">knows what it is it&amp;#39;s not health</text>
  <text start="831.81" dur="4.59">insurance for the American people and</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="5.46">guess what the American people there was</text>
  <text start="836.4" dur="6.63">a poll that was taken around 2000 for in</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="6.9">2014 and there were sixty percent</text>
  <text start="843.03" dur="6.33">believe Obamacare regulations will hike</text>
  <text start="846.3" dur="5.49">their health care costs in the long run</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="5.22">well of course it&amp;#39;s going to because</text>
  <text start="851.79" dur="4.95">they don&amp;#39;t have the members in Obamacare</text>
  <text start="854.58" dur="5.37">they thought they thought if they put a</text>
  <text start="856.74" dur="6.27">penalty it would drive everyone into</text>
  <text start="859.95" dur="6.45">health care well I hate to say it they</text>
  <text start="863.01" dur="7.11">forgot one important thing the human</text>
  <text start="866.4" dur="6.12">being and their mind people say listen</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s the last thing I need right now I</text>
  <text start="872.52" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t have work I have to put food on</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="6.06">the table I have to pay my rent and you</text>
  <text start="878.16" dur="5.1">know what I&amp;#39;m healthy right now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="881.37" dur="3.09">need it and this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="883.26" dur="2.61">happening especially with the use of</text>
  <text start="884.46" dur="2.76">America they&amp;#39;re coming out of school</text>
  <text start="885.87" dur="2.61">they don&amp;#39;t have jobs they have a</text>
  <text start="887.22" dur="3.63">part-time job living with their parents</text>
  <text start="888.48" dur="7.53">the last thing on their mind is health</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="6.78">insurance and we understand why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.01" dur="5.37">doing this because they believe that</text>
  <text start="897.63" dur="7.83">after the war they&amp;#39;re going to recreate</text>
  <text start="901.38" dur="6.06">in their minds of what the United States</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="4.17">should be they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="907.44" dur="4.41">Constitution they want people taught a</text>
  <text start="909.63" dur="4.59">certain way and they want them disarmed</text>
  <text start="911.85" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;re trying to do this every way</text>
  <text start="914.22" dur="6.62">possible and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="6.63">different states and acting draconian</text>
  <text start="920.84" dur="4.27">gun laws which are completely null and</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="3.57">void according to the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="925.11" dur="3.99">and of course New York is one of them</text>
  <text start="927.51" dur="2.97">and we understand why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="929.1" dur="4.92">because they&amp;#39;re afraid when the collapse</text>
  <text start="930.48" dur="6.75">comes these populated areas are going to</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="5.67">rise up and go after the people in</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="3.54">Washington and try to remove them so</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re trying to get all these</text>
  <text start="940.77" dur="3.63">populated areas</text>
  <text start="942.3" dur="5.46">have all their weapons removed from them</text>
  <text start="944.4" dur="5.19">and the safe act in New York is having a</text>
  <text start="947.76" dur="3.66">problem because they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="949.59" dur="3.6">database for ammunition set up and</text>
  <text start="951.42" dur="3.75">almost like Obamacare you leave anything</text>
  <text start="953.19" dur="5.07">to the government it seems like they can</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="4.74">never get anything done and right now</text>
  <text start="958.26" dur="3.39">they were out there saying no we have to</text>
  <text start="959.91" dur="3.96">have the same stack we we need to have</text>
  <text start="961.65" dur="4.32">it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s we need to have it as fast</text>
  <text start="963.87" dur="3.36">as we possibly can well it&amp;#39;s been over a</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="3.57">year now and they can&amp;#39;t even get</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="4.32">database up and running and again</text>
  <text start="969.54" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="971.55" dur="4.62">this law was bad to begin with it was</text>
  <text start="974.01" dur="5.13">passed in the middle of the night in a</text>
  <text start="976.17" dur="8.79">message of necessity and again if it was</text>
  <text start="979.14" dur="7.83">so if it were really a necessity why is</text>
  <text start="984.96" dur="3.96">it taking over a year to implement the</text>
  <text start="986.97" dur="4.32">entire law because that&amp;#39;s not what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="988.92" dur="6.42">really about it&amp;#39;s about just disarming</text>
  <text start="991.29" dur="6.06">the American people now Homeland</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="4.17">Security we know what Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="997.35" dur="6.33">is designed for it is not designed to</text>
  <text start="999.51" dur="7.05">get the International or terrorists that</text>
  <text start="1003.68" dur="6.2">are outside of the country homeland</text>
  <text start="1006.56" dur="5.82">security DHS is designed for domestic</text>
  <text start="1009.88" dur="5.17">terrorists this is what it was created</text>
  <text start="1012.38" dur="4.74">for it was created to control the</text>
  <text start="1015.05" dur="4.05">American people and right now there were</text>
  <text start="1017.12" dur="4.83">leaked homeland security documents and</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="6.3">they revealed details of a joint DHS</text>
  <text start="1021.95" dur="5.31">FEMA national exercise to set to take</text>
  <text start="1025.4" dur="3.57">place this week and one of the</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="3.33">components of which revolves around an</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="3.5">effort to counter online dissent by a</text>
  <text start="1030.59" dur="5.19">group called free Americans against</text>
  <text start="1032.47" dur="4.84">socialist tyranny and again this this</text>
  <text start="1035.78" dur="3.66">exercise is designed to evaluate</text>
  <text start="1037.31" dur="4.89">readiness and preparation for a</text>
  <text start="1039.44" dur="5.76">catastrophic incident natural disaster</text>
  <text start="1042.2" dur="4.89">or a major act of terrorism some of the</text>
  <text start="1045.2" dur="3.72">scenarios which will be in play during</text>
  <text start="1047.09" dur="4.74">the exercise included a series of</text>
  <text start="1048.92" dur="7.49">earthquakes tsunamis and nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="1051.83" dur="9.45">accident and one important part of this</text>
  <text start="1056.41" dur="7.33">is the Free American Americans against</text>
  <text start="1061.28" dur="6.63">socialist tyranny and this is a group</text>
  <text start="1063.74" dur="5.91">that is against the government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1067.91" dur="4.41">talking about it on social media that</text>
  <text start="1069.65" dur="5.94">has alternative media and and you know</text>
  <text start="1072.32" dur="5.64">they advertise anti-us rhetoric focus</text>
  <text start="1075.59" dur="4.23">the Department of Defense as well as to</text>
  <text start="1077.96" dur="4.17">recruit like-minded individuals to join</text>
  <text start="1079.82" dur="4.08">their cause and again this is almost</text>
  <text start="1082.13" dur="3.84">like the alternative media out there or</text>
  <text start="1083.9" dur="3.54">people who are putting videos up that</text>
  <text start="1085.97" dur="3.449">show a different side of what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1087.44" dur="4.14">going on and this is who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1089.419" dur="4.021">targeting those people who believe in</text>

  <text start="1107.21" dur="2.819">and this is why they&amp;#39;re setting all this</text>
  <text start="1108.59" dur="3.6">up this is why they&amp;#39;re having all the</text>
  <text start="1110.029" dur="3.87">exercises this is why they&amp;#39;re having the</text>

  <text start="1136.82" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re doing this this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="1139.039" dur="7.171">to control the American people when the</text>

  <text start="1917.66" dur="4.59">has been making deals with China the</text>
  <text start="1920.45" dur="5.58">making deals with India and other</text>
  <text start="1922.25" dur="5.37">nations just in case the US and European</text>
  <text start="1926.03" dur="4.56">nations implement sanctions on the</text>

  <text start="1930.59" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re not going to do right away</text>
  <text start="1931.76" dur="6.84">because this would implode Europe and</text>

  <text start="1962.21" dur="6.18">more worried about a nuclear bomb in</text>
  <text start="1964.58" dur="7.5">Manhattan well the first reason is to</text>
  <text start="1968.39" dur="5.82">keep us scared to remove our rights that</text>
  <text start="1972.08" dur="4.62">there are terrorists out there and there</text>
  <text start="1974.21" dur="5.28">could be some type of dirty bomb or</text>

  <text start="2007.81" dur="3.05">realized</text>
  <text start="2008.32" dur="6.599">is that the central bank realizes that</text>
