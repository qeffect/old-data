  <text start="35.73" dur="5.82">episode 946 be and today&amp;#39;s date is april</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="5.581">fifteenth 2016 and the title the episode</text>
  <text start="41.55" dur="5.759">is war plans are being drawn up for</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="5.88">World War 3 let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.309" dur="6.631">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="6.449">now back in 2012 when we had the Sandy</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="4.23">Hook shooting in the elementary school</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="3.861">and of course as we all know this is a</text>
  <text start="58.17" dur="4.349">complete false flag and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="60.17" dur="4.87">understand why it is just look at</text>
  <text start="62.519" dur="5.191">wolfgang halbig and his site he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="6.29">tracking this he&amp;#39;s been looking at all</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="8.269">the evidence and he has been in court</text>
  <text start="71.33" dur="7.179">proving that this was a complete hoax</text>
  <text start="75.979" dur="8.381">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is their agenda</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="8.071">right now it&amp;#39;s to take weapons away from</text>
  <text start="84.36" dur="4.11">the people and make it impossible for</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.32">people to get certain types of weapons</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="4.71">and they always start with the military</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.48">looking type of weapons and then they go</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="2.97">down from there and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="3">trying to do at this point and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="3.84">been trying for many many years and</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve had no success whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="4.95">right now a US judge has ruled that</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="5.88">families of the victims of the Sandy</text>
  <text start="104.94" dur="6.24">Hook shooting they can sue the maker of</text>
  <text start="107.76" dur="6.12">the weapon used in the attack arguing</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="5.549">that the Bushmaster rifle is a military</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="5.61">weapon that should have not been sold to</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="5.851">civilians well I hate to say this but</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="5.96">the Second Amendment sends says the</text>
  <text start="122.58" dur="6.179">people have the right to bear arms and</text>
  <text start="125.45" dur="6.28">arms means military-style weapons bear</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="7.2">means to hold and carry and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="6.81">happening here is that the gun companies</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="5.221">they sought to reject the negligence and</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="6.6">wrongful death lawsuit filed two years</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="7.11">ago after the attack but the Connecticut</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.03">Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellus said</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="5.1">a 2005 federal law protecting gun makers</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="4.8">from lawsuits does not shield a company</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="4.26">from legal action in this case she ruled</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="4.08">that lawyers for the victims families</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="5.52">can still argue the semi-automatic rifle</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="4.53">is a military weapon and should not be</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="3.86">sold to civilian</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="5.82">which is absolutely ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="6.73">the Constitution the Bill of Rights says</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="6.66">nothing about this and it just tells us</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="6.87">that we could have arms which is equal</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="5.7">and equivalent to the military and this</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="4.23">whole thing probably will go to appeals</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="3.84">court and will probably rule down but</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="4.95">the very interesting thing about this is</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="5.88">this then will spread to other companies</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="4.86">think about it that the company</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="5.22">shouldn&amp;#39;t be selling this to civilians</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="5">because it&amp;#39;s a military weapon so if we</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.98">take that and we say okay people with</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="6.039">military-style equipment like maybe</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="5.37">Hummers and they decide okay I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="4.741">to get into the Hummer that I purchased</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="5.52">which the military uses and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="7.56">go plow down 15 people so now who makes</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="7.53">it GM GM would be sued and then lawyers</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="5.43">will take this and say okay anyone that</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="4.5">gets into a car and gets into an</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="4.769">accident it&amp;#39;s the car manufacturer</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="5.13">isthmus fault and they&amp;#39;ll do this with</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="5.461">any product a kitchen knife person went</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.08">into a school stabbed 15 people whoever</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="3.84">made the kitchen knife they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="5.64">responsible for this and we see that</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="6.65">this whole thing is not about the</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="8.069">inanimate object it&amp;#39;s about the person</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="6.64">because people do the act not the</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="4.921">inanimate object now you can sue the</text>
  <text start="250.8" dur="7.23">company if there&amp;#39;s a problem with the</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="8.37">product if it&amp;#39;s faulty but you can&amp;#39;t sue</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="7.23">a company just because a person decided</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="5.46">to pick up a baseball bat and smash</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="4.35">people in the head I mean it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="4.62">to feel like we&amp;#39;re in the bizarro world</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="4.08">at this point and we can see what</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="5.01">anything and everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="6.24">can to remove the weapons from the</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="5.31">people and their don&amp;#39;t even care about</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="5.7">the rights they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="4.95">Constitution there&amp;#39;s so far off base at</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.789">this point it is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="5.28">and let&amp;#39;s take this a step further now</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="5.081">we know a lot of people put their</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="4.08">personal information on the cloud for</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="3.18">data storage I</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="4.41">personally do not because it&amp;#39;s out of my</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.16">reach I don&amp;#39;t like it being someplace</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="5.97">where I don&amp;#39;t have full control I keep</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="5.85">all information locked up in my safe I</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="5.16">back it up onto a drive and I lock it in</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="5.75">a safe that I have so what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="7.41">happening here is that the US government</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="7.2">they have access to those people who</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="7.59">keep their information on the cloud and</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="7.15">Internet users will never know that</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="4.71">their information has been searched now</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="5.58">this is coming from Michael Microsoft&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="4.89">president Brad Smith Microsoft sued the</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="3.78">US government in federal court in the</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="5.07">state of Washington claiming the secrecy</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="4.98">orders have become so routine that a</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="3.93">provision in the US Constitution banning</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="6.36">unreasonable searches or personal</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="8.88">property no longer applies over the past</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="8.43">18 months the US government has been</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="8.48">requesting and maintaining this secrecy</text>
  <text start="360.54" dur="7.17">regarding like 2,500 legal demands and</text>
  <text start="364.82" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this because</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="3.87">they feel that oh since you&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="2.97">it up in the cloud we just have free</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="2.97">access and we don&amp;#39;t have to tell you</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="4.86">about it well if you have that</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="7.71">information in your home would you be</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="8.16">okay with it no so you could see that</text>
  <text start="382.26" dur="4.92">they are going off the track here they</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t care about the Constitution they</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="5.57">don&amp;#39;t care about the rights of the</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="7.65">people and we see that the CIA right now</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="7.06">they are looking at different investment</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="5.13">companies to help develop artificial</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="4.61">intelligence to sift through enormous</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="7.49">numbers of social media postings and</text>
  <text start="404.42" dur="7.6">decipher patterns of people and actually</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="7.75">collect information from social media</text>
  <text start="412.02" dur="7.41">and use it so a document that was</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="5.79">obtained by the intercept indicates that</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="5.85">in in-q-tel the CIA&amp;#39;s venture capital</text>
  <text start="423" dur="5.73">firm they have made unpublicized</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="6.14">investments in 38 different companies to</text>
  <text start="428.73" dur="4.31">have this completed so</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="5.19">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="6.24">spying has not stopped our rights are</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="8.51">being completely violated every single</text>
  <text start="439.28" dur="9.48">day and the US government doesn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="5.11">they haven&amp;#39;t cared about the people in a</text>
  <text start="448.76" dur="4.5">very long time they care about</text>
  <text start="450.23" dur="4.44">themselves they care about foreign</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="3.18">entities they fit care about</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="4.08">corporations they care about the central</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="3.99">bank they care about themselves but they</text>
  <text start="458.75" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t care about the country and doing</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="3.81">what&amp;#39;s right for the people you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="4.35">everything opposite that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="4.56">supposed to be doing in office right now</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="4.68">and this is why all these people need to</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="5.82">be removed at this point because we have</text>
  <text start="471.53" dur="6.98">to start saying enough is enough now out</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="6.21">in the EU after the bombing in Brussels</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="4.27">we knew that there were going to be more</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="4.26">draconian laws new ways of tracking</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="4.92">people and we knew that this was part of</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="6.66">the agenda and we see the European</text>
  <text start="487.7" dur="6.09">Parliament they adopted a plan to force</text>
  <text start="491.75" dur="4.65">airlines to share passenger information</text>
  <text start="493.79" dur="6.99">with EU states now what are they going</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="8.04">to collect well passenger name they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="6.78">going to collect itinerary travel dates</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="5.67">payment method phone numbers and any</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="5.13">other piece of information they can</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="4.2">possibly get from you the data is going</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.89">to be stored in a new passenger</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="5.58">information unit and it&amp;#39;ll be passed all</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="5.25">over the place to keep track of you to</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="5.31">follow you and we see this is more</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="5.7">government control this does not keep</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="6.68">you safer we know because everything</text>
  <text start="528.53" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;ve done to stop the fake terrorism</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="8.14">hasn&amp;#39;t worked haven&amp;#39;t we been doing this</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="9.3">since 2008 it&amp;#39;s been what eight years</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="7.83">and has anyone seen terrorism decline no</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="5.01">because it hasn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="3.33">these are real terrorist acts we know</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="3.84">these are all false flags to convince</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="4.65">the people that they&amp;#39;re terrorists out</text>
  <text start="553.52" dur="3.99">there but if we believe the official</text>
  <text start="555.83" dur="3.57">story that there&amp;#39;s terrorists running</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="3.93">around and we need all the security we</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="3.75">need to spy on you we need to keep track</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="3.66">of you we need to know everything about</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="4.05">you this will keep you safe</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="3.92">have they really kept us safe if you</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="3.51">really believe what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="569.02" dur="5.14">actually they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="570.71" dur="7.62">terrorism is getting worse so at this</text>
  <text start="574.16" dur="6.21">point I can they&amp;#39;re lying to us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="5.64">lying if you believe their official</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="6.27">story this stuff doesn&amp;#39;t work but again</text>
  <text start="583.97" dur="5.49">we know the truth we know that these are</text>
  <text start="586.64" dur="6.33">false flags we know they&amp;#39;re using it for</text>
  <text start="589.46" dur="5.16">certain agendas and this is why it will</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="4.77">never work the only thing that will</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="6.54">happen from all of this is they&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="5.91">tabs on everyone they will remove more</text>
  <text start="601.16" dur="5.72">rights they will violate more rights of</text>
  <text start="603.65" dur="7.23">the people that&amp;#39;s their main objective</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="6.82">now South Korea is reporting that North</text>
  <text start="610.88" dur="5.31">Korea they launched a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="4.8">off its east coast but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="4.98">the launch failed and this is according</text>
  <text start="618.5" dur="6.24">to the south korean defense minister now</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="7.65">the u.s. is saying that they track the</text>
  <text start="624.74" dur="6.75">missile but they&amp;#39;re not going to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.82" dur="5.22">not going to reveal the details of the</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="4.26">missile the type of missile and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="4.92">going to leave it up to North Korea to</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="5.64">explain what actually they did now this</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="3.99">is very odd because if they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="641.39" dur="3.48">prove that North Korea is actually doing</text>
  <text start="642.95" dur="5.37">this why wouldn&amp;#39;t they show the proof</text>
  <text start="644.87" dur="5.21">and I find this happening over and over</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="4.38">again they&amp;#39;re putting out information</text>
  <text start="650.08" dur="4.9">they&amp;#39;re telling you what happened but</text>
  <text start="652.7" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re refusing to show proof or they</text>
  <text start="654.98" dur="4.92">have nothing to back up what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="4.77">saying now the government needs to prove</text>
  <text start="659.9" dur="4.53">to the people that this is actually</text>
  <text start="661.43" dur="5.13">going on they just can&amp;#39;t say it they</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="4.95">need to show the people this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.56" dur="5.13">happening here is the proof and I notice</text>
  <text start="669.38" dur="4.8">with everything that they&amp;#39;re doing at</text>
  <text start="671.69" dur="5.57">this point they kind of leave off the</text>
  <text start="674.18" dur="6.78">proof part they use a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="677.26" dur="4.81">they use a lot of words to try to</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="4.38">convince you that this is really</text>
  <text start="682.07" dur="6.81">happening but they&amp;#39;re really not showing</text>
  <text start="685.34" dur="6.66">the proof it was almost like in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="688.88" dur="4.83">when they kept on saying Oh Russia is</text>
  <text start="692" dur="3.96">invading Russia is invading and of</text>
  <text start="693.71" dur="4.44">course back then they tried to show</text>
  <text start="695.96" dur="2.939">proof but they were showing these black</text>
  <text start="698.15" dur="3.419">and whites at</text>
  <text start="698.899" dur="4.5">light imagery with Photoshop drawings</text>
  <text start="701.569" dur="5.281">they were showing pictures all the way</text>
  <text start="703.399" dur="6.031">back to 2009 and all of it was debunked</text>
  <text start="706.85" dur="4.83">so they stopped showing the fake</text>
  <text start="709.43" dur="3.959">information and now they decided we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="3.089">not going to show anything anymore and</text>
  <text start="713.389" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;re just going to say it and hopefully</text>
  <text start="714.769" dur="6">the people believe it but we see out in</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="5.64">Ukraine right now is that the fighting</text>
  <text start="720.769" dur="4.38">there is intensifying the osc is warning</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="5.149">that things are getting worse in that</text>
  <text start="725.149" dur="6.36">area that fighting is intensifying</text>
  <text start="728.199" dur="5.771">poroshenko he wants a police mission in</text>
  <text start="731.509" dur="5.13">dawn boss he&amp;#39;s trying to coordinate this</text>
  <text start="733.97" dur="5.099">of course he has not fulfilled the minsk</text>
  <text start="736.639" dur="6.24">to cease fire agreement whatsoever it</text>
  <text start="739.069" dur="7.981">looks like they&amp;#39;re not even trying to to</text>
  <text start="742.879" dur="5.76">go ahead and complete the deal and it</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="3.36">looks like at this point that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="748.639" dur="3.63">trying to get into the EU because they</text>
  <text start="750.41" dur="5.909">got rid of yachts and yuck and it looks</text>
  <text start="752.269" dur="7.711">like they want the southeastern and the</text>
  <text start="756.319" dur="5.041">crimea area back with Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="3.599">this is what the central bankers paid</text>
  <text start="761.36" dur="4.949">for I mean they didn&amp;#39;t spend billions of</text>
  <text start="763.579" dur="4.95">dollars in this coup d&amp;#39;etat to only get</text>
  <text start="766.309" dur="4.08">the west portion of Ukraine that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="768.529" dur="4.86">waste for them they want the entire</text>
  <text start="770.389" dur="8.521">country and they want the port on the</text>
  <text start="773.389" dur="8.281">Black Sea so we see right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="5.159">is trying to provoke war everywhere on</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="4.8">the US they have launched military</text>
  <text start="784.069" dur="5.31">patrols in the South China Sea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="786.47" dur="4.739">rotating weapons in the Philippines</text>
  <text start="789.379" dur="4.37">right now bringing in more advanced</text>
  <text start="791.209" dur="6.06">weapons they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke China</text>
  <text start="793.749" dur="8.8">we see a Russian jet which we discussed</text>
  <text start="797.269" dur="7.29">before flew very close to the USS Donald</text>
  <text start="802.549" dur="4.53">cook last time this happened they</text>
  <text start="804.559" dur="5.101">knocked out all the electronics with</text>
  <text start="807.079" dur="5.25">their jamming system and the USS Donald</text>
  <text start="809.66" dur="5.07">cook had to be towed away and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="812.329" dur="5.43">is going crazy over this and the US</text>
  <text start="814.73" dur="5.399">destroyer was in the Baltic Sea and the</text>
  <text start="817.759" dur="5.49">jets flew very close they were unarmed</text>
  <text start="820.129" dur="6.3">completely but you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="823.249" dur="6.601">USS Donald cook is deployed in the</text>
  <text start="826.429" dur="6.451">peaceful Baltic Sea off the coast of the</text>
  <text start="829.85" dur="7.29">Russian exclave of</text>
  <text start="832.88" dur="6.99">Colin grad right near one of their bases</text>
  <text start="837.14" dur="5.82">and jets are flying back and forth and</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="4.98">yes if they see a warship very close to</text>
  <text start="842.96" dur="4.59">here they&amp;#39;re going to check it out just</text>
  <text start="844.85" dur="6">like the US would check it out if Russia</text>
  <text start="847.55" dur="6.42">China or any other nation had ships in</text>
  <text start="850.85" dur="6.63">the Gulf of Mexico selling very close to</text>
  <text start="853.97" dur="6.6">a base out in the Pacific out in the</text>
  <text start="857.48" dur="5.87">Atlantic even when the US or Russia</text>
  <text start="860.57" dur="7.68">flies their bombers in international</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="7.81">areas yes jets fly up to meet it and the</text>
  <text start="868.25" dur="4.47">same thing was happening here and of</text>
  <text start="871.16" dur="3.12">course Russia&amp;#39;s saying they were</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="3.87">operating well within their safety</text>
  <text start="874.28" dur="4.02">guidelines that the u.s. freedom of</text>
  <text start="876.59" dur="4.56">navigation near a Russian naval base</text>
  <text start="878.3" dur="5.12">does not at all cancel the principle of</text>
  <text start="881.15" dur="5.13">freedom of flight for Russian aircraft</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="7.9">but John Kerry said something very</text>
  <text start="886.28" dur="7.08">interesting saying that the US would</text>
  <text start="891.32" dur="5.49">have been justified shooting down an</text>
  <text start="893.36" dur="6.27">unarmed Russian jet which is kind of</text>
  <text start="896.81" dur="5.66">strange in itself because we&amp;#39;re at peace</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="6.84">right now we&amp;#39;re not at war with Russia</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="6.46">it was an unarmed jet and why would be</text>
  <text start="906.47" dur="4.77">why would you think that one of the</text>
  <text start="908.93" dur="5.79">moves would be to shoot it down well</text>
  <text start="911.24" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s what they want to do they were</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="4.77">hoping maybe the jet was armed because</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="3.63">they would have said okay it was armed</text>
  <text start="919.49" dur="3.48">and that&amp;#39;s why we had to shoot down</text>
  <text start="921.56" dur="3.51">because we didn&amp;#39;t know the intentions of</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="6">the jet because they had turkey do this</text>
  <text start="925.07" dur="6.48">in Syria because what are they trying to</text>
  <text start="928.97" dur="8.21">do they&amp;#39;re trying to start a war now out</text>
  <text start="931.55" dur="9.3">in Libya we see that NATO France US UK</text>
  <text start="937.18" dur="6.76">Egypt Italy they&amp;#39;re all ready to go into</text>
  <text start="940.85" dur="4.95">Libya of course they keep using the idea</text>
  <text start="943.94" dur="3.33">that they&amp;#39;re waiting for the unity</text>
  <text start="945.8" dur="3.69">government to invite them in and then</text>
  <text start="947.27" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ll go because we don&amp;#39;t want to just</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="4.5">go in there not invited the European</text>
  <text start="951.77" dur="4.08">Union right now is saying that they will</text>
  <text start="953.99" dur="5.31">consider moving security personnel into</text>
  <text start="955.85" dur="6.15">Libya to help stabilize the country only</text>
  <text start="959.3" dur="5.789">if the unity government invites us in</text>
  <text start="962" dur="4.44">and all of this and what all this is</text>
  <text start="965.089" dur="4.231">telling us is</text>
  <text start="966.44" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re going to be invited in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="969.32" dur="4.44">just building this up to let everyone</text>
  <text start="971.84" dur="3.96">know that this new government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.76" dur="6.09">being put into place will invite</text>
  <text start="975.8" dur="7.41">everyone in ground troops air bombings</text>
  <text start="979.85" dur="6.74">you name it they will be allowed to come</text>
  <text start="983.21" dur="5.88">into Libya and this is what they use</text>
  <text start="986.59" dur="4.99">before all of this begins to show</text>
  <text start="989.09" dur="5.52">everyone know they invited us in this</text>
  <text start="991.58" dur="8.19">wasn&amp;#39;t planned now turkish President</text>
  <text start="994.61" dur="9.27">Erdogan he is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="999.77" dur="6.93">dictator and he&amp;#39;s going after everyone</text>
  <text start="1003.88" dur="5.24">at this point if you make fun of him he</text>
  <text start="1006.7" dur="5.07">doesn&amp;#39;t like it he wants you jailed and</text>
  <text start="1009.12" dur="5.64">it looks like he&amp;#39;s going after a German</text>
  <text start="1011.77" dur="6.75">comedian and this German comedian</text>
  <text start="1014.76" dur="6.85">released a satirical video poem about</text>
  <text start="1018.52" dur="5.36">the turkish President and it seems that</text>
  <text start="1021.61" dur="6.27">he wants charges brought up on this</text>
  <text start="1023.88" dur="5.5">comedian now the video fell under the</text>
  <text start="1027.88" dur="3.36">protective cloak of the right to</text>
  <text start="1029.38" dur="4.23">artistic freedom press freedom and</text>
  <text start="1031.24" dur="4.86">freedom of opinion but remember</text>
  <text start="1033.61" dur="4.589">dictators don&amp;#39;t care about that but</text>
  <text start="1036.1" dur="5.06">Germany does have a law which is rarely</text>
  <text start="1038.199" dur="5.701">used in section 103 of the Criminal Code</text>
  <text start="1041.16" dur="6.82">insulting organs or representatives of</text>
  <text start="1043.9" dur="6.35">foreign states is illegal and it seems</text>
  <text start="1047.98" dur="5.13">like they&amp;#39;re going to be using this law</text>
  <text start="1050.25" dur="4.96">to go after this person now they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1053.11" dur="3.75">really used it we know in Germany they</text>
  <text start="1055.21" dur="3.33">have these parades where they have</text>
  <text start="1056.86" dur="4.35">political figures and they make fun of</text>
  <text start="1058.54" dur="4.77">them but it they don&amp;#39;t use the law at</text>
  <text start="1061.21" dur="5.84">that point in time so right now it looks</text>
  <text start="1063.31" dur="6.57">like Merkel is folding and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1067.05" dur="5.2">follow this up but again what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1069.88" dur="5.99">doing right now is taking away the</text>
  <text start="1072.25" dur="7.49">freedom of expression freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="1075.87" dur="7.9">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is dictators</text>
  <text start="1079.74" dur="6.55">all around the globe trying to remove</text>
  <text start="1083.77" dur="6">the rights of the people and this is how</text>
  <text start="1086.29" dur="6.57">it begins and it gets worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="1089.77" dur="5.4">time goes on now right now the World</text>
  <text start="1092.86" dur="5.55">Bank is estimating the damage in Syria</text>
  <text start="1095.17" dur="9.78">around 180 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="1098.41" dur="9.98">and Turkey as Syrians flee the</text>
  <text start="1104.95" dur="6.93">controlled areas of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1108.39" dur="6.28">they are firing on them and a Human</text>
  <text start="1111.88" dur="6.63">Rights Watch has cold on Turkey to stop</text>
  <text start="1114.67" dur="8.22">firing on Syrian civilians and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1118.51" dur="7.89">killing them so the UN refugee agency</text>
  <text start="1122.89" dur="5.55">asked Ankara to provide data on the</text>
  <text start="1126.4" dur="4.23">possible refugee deaths in shelling on</text>
  <text start="1128.44" dur="4.86">the Syrian border and they&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="1130.63" dur="6.69">them why is this happening why are using</text>
  <text start="1133.3" dur="8.52">live ammunition why are you firing on</text>
  <text start="1137.32" dur="7.14">unarmed civilians which makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1141.82" dur="5.97">except that turkeys trying to start a</text>
  <text start="1144.46" dur="6.06">war in this area and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1147.79" dur="6.78">shelling on government forces they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1150.52" dur="7.11">shelling everywhere to keep their open</text>
  <text start="1154.57" dur="6.06">corridor to keep the terrace supplied</text>
  <text start="1157.63" dur="5.58">with weapons and Lavrov is out there</text>
  <text start="1160.63" dur="5.13">saying that they should have internet</text>
  <text start="1163.21" dur="5.37">international monitors on the</text>
  <text start="1165.76" dur="4.92">syrian-turkish border to plug up the</text>
  <text start="1168.58" dur="4.68">holes and they&amp;#39;re asking the United</text>
  <text start="1170.68" dur="4.89">States to do that to coordinate with</text>
  <text start="1173.26" dur="6.08">them to help do this and we know jay</text>
  <text start="1175.57" dur="6.15">johnson was out there installing</text>
  <text start="1179.34" dur="4.9">balloons to monitor the area</text>
  <text start="1181.72" dur="6.48">surveillance equipment building a</text>
  <text start="1184.24" dur="6.3">partial wall but all this was done was</text>
  <text start="1188.2" dur="5.97">to keep track of their proxy army and to</text>
  <text start="1190.54" dur="6.48">keep them moving in and out now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1194.17" dur="4.59">hasn&amp;#39;t responded to this yet because</text>
  <text start="1197.02" dur="6.77">they don&amp;#39;t want these holes plugged they</text>
  <text start="1198.76" dur="8.61">want the terrace the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1203.79" dur="6.57">armed and continually armed because</text>
  <text start="1207.37" dur="6.09">their main mission is to get Assad and</text>
