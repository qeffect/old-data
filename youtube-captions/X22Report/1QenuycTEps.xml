  <text start="84.21" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="6.59">mainstream media political pundits and</text>
  <text start="89.91" dur="6.89">many other people believe that Trump is</text>
  <text start="92.84" dur="6.85">pushing a trade war now on the surface</text>
  <text start="96.8" dur="6.459">yes it does look like a trade war</text>
  <text start="99.69" dur="5.879">because he used tariffs and everyone</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="5.431">remembers back to the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="105.569" dur="5.22">around that time period where tariffs</text>
  <text start="108.69" dur="4.08">were implemented and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="110.789" dur="4.651">media is continually building up the</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="6.689">idea and financial pundits that tariffs</text>
  <text start="115.44" dur="6.87">are a bad thing they start wars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.459" dur="4.291">not good for the economy they&amp;#39;re awful</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="4.5">remember this is coming from the central</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="6.63">bank the mainstream media what happens</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="7.38">if this is not a trade war what happens</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="6.3">if this is really a war on the central</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="5.79">bank now of course is the mainstream</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="6.74">media gonna report that absolutely not</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="7.32">and we&amp;#39;re starting to get real</text>
  <text start="143.42" dur="6.88">indication that this is a war on the</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="6.269">central bank and not a trade war now</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="6.6">if we look at what Trump is doing he</text>
  <text start="153.569" dur="7.351">needs to reverse everything that has</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="6.53">been done to this country and not just</text>
  <text start="160.92" dur="4.83">this country but the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="5.399">remember the globalist the central banks</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="6.629">they were setting up an economic system</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="5.891">that was going to work for them Trump</text>
  <text start="172.379" dur="6.871">now is undoing this and he needs the</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="6.599">u.s. MCA because this is one piece to</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="6.09">the puzzle there are many other pieces</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="6.12">but he needs this past for the plan to</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="5.19">move forward this is why he&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="187.439" dur="6.901">process of boxing in Pelosi right now</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="6.84">and he&amp;#39;s trapped Pelosi into signing the</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="5.61">u.s. MCA we have Robert light Heiser and</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.16">the Mexican trade minister they have</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="6.03">agreed to set up a trilateral trade and</text>

  <text start="205.98" dur="7.289">cornered Pelosi this is what she was</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="6.66">complaining about and Ivanka Trump she</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="4.8">tweeted out the following a year ago</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="5.039">today at real Donald Trump signed the</text>

  <text start="243.239" dur="6.72">vote has delayed it for six months</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="7.59">see you in 2020 now having lost her</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="6.661">labor defense shield and this is well</text>
  <text start="253.109" dur="6.421">played by trump by the way Pelosi is now</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="5.04">either going to stand her party against</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="4.95">the majority of Americans as Trump</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="6">pummels them over it or she puts the</text>
  <text start="264.48" dur="6.6">u.s. MCA up for ratification Trump wins</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="3.9">and it looks like she&amp;#39;s going to take a</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="5.19">knee</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="7.98">it looks like he has boxed her in now we</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="7.68">know the u.s. MCA is a big part of the</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="7.47">overall plan it&amp;#39;s a plan to break free</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="6.06">from the globalist and the central bank</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="5.98">and think about what Trump has been</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="7.6">doing he</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="6.69">renegotiated trade deals he started to</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="5.1">place tariffs on certain countries</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="5.4">especially China he needed to bring back</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="5.07">companies and manufacturing to the</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="7.56">United States or have them moved out of</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="10.43">China he&amp;#39;s been doing that he&amp;#39;s reducing</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="8.76">regulation he&amp;#39;s creating tax incentives</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="7.66">he we know that he renegotiated a lot of</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="8.7">the global trade deals he&amp;#39;s creating an</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="7.08">American manufacturing base in the</text>
  <text start="330.1" dur="7.32">Americas to combat the global system</text>
  <text start="332.95" dur="6.03">which they were moving to China think</text>
  <text start="337.42" dur="4.08">about everything that China has been</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="4.08">doing think about the financial markets</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="3.41">that had been moved to China think about</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="5.25">manufacturing that&amp;#39;s been moved to China</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="7.32">Trump is now countering this with the</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="7.53">u.s. MCA and the Americas to go against</text>
  <text start="352.23" dur="6.6">China and when I say China I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="6.11">about the global essential bank system</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="7.93">he needed to make the u.s. energy</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="9.42">independent and what do we see today US</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="7.62">exports of crude and petroleum products</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="6.46">this includes gasoline diesel jet flu</text>
  <text start="374.38" dur="5.73">and many others exceeded imports in</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="5.49">September by 89 thousand barrels a day</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="6.18">the EIA reported today and so the u.s.</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="5.37">became a net exporter of crude oil and</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="5.58">petroleum products for their first time</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="9.18">on a monthly basis in the EIA s data</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="8.54">going all the way back to 1973 all the</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="5.82">way back to 1970 what happened in 1971</text>
  <text start="400.41" dur="4.6">we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="3.96">remember Nixon took us off the gold</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="4.41">standard because of speculators and then</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.32">all of a sudden we were moved on to this</text>
  <text start="409.42" dur="6.33">petro dollar system where we were</text>
  <text start="411.97" dur="7.92">dependent on oil from the Middle East so</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="7.8">this is since 1973 that we haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="6.12">in net exporter now imports of crude oil</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="3.299">and petroleum products from OPEC drop to</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="2.909">just one</text>
  <text start="426.849" dur="4.68">point four million barrels per day the</text>
  <text start="428.919" dur="7.14">lowest in the data series going back to</text>
  <text start="431.529" dur="8.491">1993 down 75% from 5.6 million barrels</text>
  <text start="436.059" dur="5.6">per day at the peak in 2008 US</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.069">production of crude oil and petroleum</text>
  <text start="441.659" dur="6.16">products has spiked from 6.8 million</text>
  <text start="445.089" dur="5.34">barrels per day in 2008 to seventeen</text>
  <text start="447.819" dur="5.64">point five million barrels per day in</text>
  <text start="450.429" dur="5.25">September largely due to the ramp up and</text>
  <text start="453.459" dur="4.41">shale oil production and remember Shale</text>
  <text start="455.679" dur="4.32">wells they can also produce a large</text>
  <text start="457.869" dur="7.11">quantity of gases that are counted</text>
  <text start="459.999" dur="10.29">separately as gas now since the US has</text>
  <text start="464.979" dur="8.67">become a net exporter the u.s. cannot be</text>
  <text start="470.289" dur="5.63">blackmailed any more over oil you think</text>
  <text start="473.649" dur="5.76">Trump has done this on purpose</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="6.911">absolutely if there is like another oil</text>
  <text start="479.409" dur="5.82">embargo that came along the US would</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="5.099">just shrug it off and when the price of</text>
  <text start="485.229" dur="4.381">oil rises due to this embargo US</text>
  <text start="487.929" dur="4.14">drillers will ramp up production and</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="5.789">within months the world would be awash</text>
  <text start="492.069" dur="6.18">in US oil in other words the US cannot</text>
  <text start="495.399" dur="5.04">be blackmailed anymore over oil the way</text>
  <text start="498.249" dur="7.89">it used to and the world knows it and</text>
  <text start="500.439" dur="8.81">that&amp;#39;s a form of Independence Trump is</text>
  <text start="506.139" dur="5.25">taking each piece of the puzzle and</text>
  <text start="509.249" dur="3.73">everything that the globalists the</text>
  <text start="511.389" dur="5.13">central bank the deep state has done</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="6.6">before where they&amp;#39;ve created a petro</text>
  <text start="516.519" dur="5.58">dollar system based on oil all the oil</text>
  <text start="519.579" dur="7.2">was based out of the Middle East he is</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="6.451">now reversing this and since the United</text>
  <text start="526.779" dur="3.211">States can no longer be blackmailed that</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="5.219">means the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t use oil to say you must do this</text>
  <text start="533.769" dur="5.221">you need to do that all of that is</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="6.63">coming to an end this is part of the</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="8.25">major plan now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="7.11">sec since Trump is pushing this and I</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="3.99">have air quotes up here trade war</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="5.76">forward which is really a war on the</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="7.859">central bank in essence what this will</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="5.009">do this will end up destroying the</text>
  <text start="559.089" dur="3.39">dollar and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="560.259" dur="4.86">about the usdollar I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="562.479" dur="6.811">Federal Reserve note the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="565.119" dur="7.77">system so by pushing this and by</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="6.149">bringing manufacturers out of China or</text>
  <text start="572.889" dur="5.13">maybe some back to the United States by</text>
  <text start="575.439" dur="6.21">setting up the manufacturing base in the</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="8.1">Americas by becoming energy independent</text>
  <text start="581.649" dur="6.47">and not relying on the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="586.119" dur="6.72">what do I mean by this</text>
  <text start="588.119" dur="7.36">remember countries needed to use the</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="6.9">Federal Reserve note the petro dollar to</text>
  <text start="595.479" dur="5.51">pay for oil purchases if you look at</text>
  <text start="599.739" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s happening in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="600.989" dur="5.981">where the deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="603.699" dur="5.94">they no longer have control over these</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="4.5">Middle Eastern countries and the regime</text>
  <text start="609.639" dur="4.68">change that they set up is now being</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="5.959">reversed most likely what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="7.11">happen is these countries will no longer</text>
  <text start="617.429" dur="7.06">sell oil using the dollar now before</text>
  <text start="621.429" dur="4.26">2008 a lot of these countries started to</text>
  <text start="624.489" dur="3.06">do this they were going to use their own</text>
  <text start="625.689" dur="4.17">currency they were going to use gold and</text>
  <text start="627.549" dur="5.54">this is why they decided we needed to go</text>
  <text start="629.859" dur="7.31">into these different countries and</text>
  <text start="633.089" dur="6.91">reverse what they were trying to do now</text>
  <text start="637.169" dur="5.47">since they&amp;#39;ve lost their hold in the</text>
  <text start="639.999" dur="5.07">Middle East and the people are starting</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="5.85">to take back control if you look at</text>
  <text start="645.069" dur="6.091">Syria if you look at Libya if you look</text>
  <text start="648.489" dur="5.46">at net Lebanon if you look at Iraq if</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="5.279">you look at Afghanistan eventually</text>
  <text start="653.949" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is all of this is</text>
  <text start="656.439" dur="4.08">going to be reversed which means</text>
  <text start="658.779" dur="3.54">countries are going to see this and</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re going to say wait I don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="662.319" dur="3.6">to use the dollar anymore that means I</text>
  <text start="663.879" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t need to keep the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="665.919" dur="4.04">note in my reserves I don&amp;#39;t need them</text>
  <text start="669.039" dur="3.931">anymore</text>
  <text start="669.959" dur="5.141">now think about the bigger picture here</text>
  <text start="672.97" dur="5.759">the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="675.1" dur="6.899">is Trump is waging war on the system</text>
  <text start="678.729" dur="6.361">that was set up in the 70s who set this</text>
  <text start="681.999" dur="6.001">system up Kissinger</text>
  <text start="685.09" dur="8">and Kissinger is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="688" dur="8.82">if China and the US don&amp;#39;t make a deal</text>
  <text start="693.09" dur="5.17">this is going to be a disaster now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.82" dur="3.78">not going to be a disaster for the</text>
  <text start="698.26" dur="5.25">Patriots it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster for</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="5.88">the globalists the central bankers</text>
  <text start="703.51" dur="5.94">because their entire system is based on</text>
  <text start="706.48" dur="5.4">this and they know it</text>
  <text start="709.45" dur="4.14">this is why the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="711.88" dur="3.63">screaming and yelling this is why</text>
  <text start="713.59" dur="5.07">Kissinger is out there screaming and</text>
  <text start="715.51" dur="6.99">yelling this is why the European</text>
  <text start="718.66" dur="5.61">countries are very nervous and Trump</text>
  <text start="722.5" dur="5.97">understands and the Patriots understand</text>
  <text start="724.27" dur="6.18">that once this is all reversed yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.47" dur="4.44">going to go through some bumpy times</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="4.59">when we came off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="732.91" dur="3.72">we moved on to the fian system we went</text>
  <text start="735.04" dur="2.94">through some bumpy times other countries</text>
