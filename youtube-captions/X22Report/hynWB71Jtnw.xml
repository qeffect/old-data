  <text start="60.129" dur="4.5">episode is the Zika virus propaganda</text>
  <text start="62.559" dur="5.401">just fell apart it&amp;#39;s harmless and does</text>
  <text start="64.629" dur="6.001">not cause birth defects let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="67.96" dur="5.85">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="70.63" dur="7.62">geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="73.81" dur="8.25">about seta the TTIP the TPP and we know</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="6.509">out in Belgium they were saying you know</text>
  <text start="82.06" dur="5.52">something we don&amp;#39;t want to sign this</text>
  <text start="84.759" dur="5.431">deal now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="87.58" dur="6.69">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that they made</text>
  <text start="90.19" dur="7.709">an agreement and Belgium the Bologna</text>
  <text start="94.27" dur="8.22">area is now ready to sign the deal now</text>
  <text start="97.899" dur="8.041">is this absolutely true well we are</text>
  <text start="102.49" dur="6">having mixed reports come out about what</text>
  <text start="105.94" dur="5.72">actually was agreed upon and you have to</text>
  <text start="108.49" dur="7.769">remember this entire trade agreement</text>
  <text start="111.66" dur="8.079">started seven years ago and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="116.259" dur="5.881">working on this all this time and the US</text>
  <text start="119.739" dur="4.53">TTIP deal looks like it&amp;#39;s dead in the</text>
  <text start="122.14" dur="6.45">water and when you look at both of these</text>
  <text start="124.269" dur="10.021">deals it revolves around one important</text>
  <text start="128.59" dur="9.45">issue and that is the corporate court</text>
  <text start="134.29" dur="7.169">systems for seta it is called the ICS</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="5.52">the investment court system for the TTIP</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="6.441">it&amp;#39;s called the investor state dispute</text>
  <text start="143.56" dur="7.56">settlement and boasts both of these</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="8.46">court systems were which are outside of</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="10.229">the country&amp;#39;s government court systems</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="9.9">they sit above what the government can</text>
  <text start="161.349" dur="9.331">rule and this was a major roadblock with</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="6.85">Belgium and we can see why because</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re afraid that it would give</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.969">corporations the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="177.129" dur="3.541">elite the shadow governments around the</text>
  <text start="179.079" dur="4.891">world too much power</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="6.06">and it would undermine government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="6">ability to regulate and create laws and</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="6.39">to sue corporations well this is</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="4.62">absolutely true and what we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="3.42">from two different organizations like</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="3.84">the Financial Times they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="3.83">nothing has changed nothing needs to be</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="5.309">changed they just made an agreement</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="4.839">coming out of the globe and mail they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="4.021">saying nothing has changed but changes</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="5.341">are needed vilonia might not get the</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="8.25">changes at once Canada may not approve</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="7.55">the changes if wallonia gets them so we</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="7.02">don&amp;#39;t know exactly what they agreed upon</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="6.82">but this was a sticking point and we can</text>
  <text start="223.03" dur="4.5">see that most of the countries were</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="5.76">against it with the TTIP and for some</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="8.16">reason they let this one slide by and</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="9.35">this is the back-up plan for TTIP and we</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="7.44">can see right now this is to create a</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="6.82">structure where the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="6.75">corporations have power over sovereign</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="5.49">governments and we can see they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="7.859">to continue our dad something to do a</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="9.03">trade it has to do with them receiving</text>
  <text start="257.739" dur="7.921">more and more power and control of what</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="6.39">they want to do and we need to stop this</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="4.62">we can see there&amp;#39;s many protests around</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="4.89">the world stopping the TTIP and the TPP</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="6.42">and set that actually has to be stopped</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="8.37">along with the TTIP because really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.7" dur="7.2">one in the same now we&amp;#39;ve been hearing</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="4.89">for a very long time that Zika virus is</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="4.56">spreading all over the world it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="4.8">epidemic it wasn&amp;#39;t throughout the</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="5.64">corporate media there&amp;#39;s radio ads that</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="6.69">play from the CDC that you know call us</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="6.47">we can help you they are spraying toxins</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="7.29">all over the place trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="6.49">the Zika mosquito and what we&amp;#39;ve come to</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="5.31">find out is coming into the Washington</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="4.68">Post now admits it had no idea what it</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.09">was talking about but rather than</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="5.32">emitting its own science writers were</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="6.45">illiterate propagandists pushing quack</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="5.04">narratives the paper now blames other</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="4.58">scientists for the gross error by</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="6.03">publishing a headline that once again is</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.74">dishonest and deceptive they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="328.13" dur="5.7">scientists are bewildered by tzikas path</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="5.43">across Latin America and the question is</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="3.899">bewildered about what because the Zika</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="5.52">virus that is in Latin America the</text>
  <text start="337.729" dur="7.261">United States and Asia why with so many</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="6.63">people getting the Zika infection why</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="5.64">aren&amp;#39;t their birth defects this is the</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="4.89">main problem this is where the</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="5.25">propaganda is falling apart so nearly</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="6.059">nine months after Zika was declared a</text>
  <text start="355.88" dur="6.03">global health emergency where Obama went</text>
  <text start="359.389" dur="4.651">to Congress and said listen this is an</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="4.259">emergency biden went to Congress and</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="3.99">said this is a state of emergency we</text>
  <text start="366.169" dur="4.5">need the funding and we know what the</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="8.58">agenda was it&amp;#39;s to create a vaccine it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.669" dur="9.091">to give Big Pharma funds and we can see</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="5.19">right now with 650,000 people in Latin</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="4.26">America and the Caribbean including tens</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="5.28">of thousands of expectant expectant</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="5.16">mothers we&amp;#39;re seeing a very low</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="6.72">percentage of those individuals that</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="8.459">have birth defects now there is one area</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="6.929">where there is a high rate of birth</text>
  <text start="397.639" dur="6.541">defects and that is in Brazil and they</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t understand why this is because</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="3.18">when we look in Venezuela there were</text>
  <text start="405.889" dur="4.551">sixty thousand seven hundred ninety-one</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="7.07">Zika infections zero birth defects</text>
  <text start="410.44" dur="5.92">Honduras 30 1933 one birth defect</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="4.57">Guadalupe thirty thousand nine hundred</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="6.65">sixty nine zero birth defects Puerto</text>
  <text start="419" dur="9.72">Rico 29,000 to birth defects Mexico</text>
  <text start="423.01" dur="7.029">4,830 70 birth defects Brazil well they</text>
  <text start="428.72" dur="3.6">had something like two thousand or so</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="6.121">birth defects and won&amp;#39;t we come to find</text>
  <text start="432.32" dur="7.73">out is that that is the country where</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="7.29">they sprayed heavily for the Zika virus</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="8.29">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="9.3">the toxins to get rid of the mosquito</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="7.109">is what is causing microcephaly and the</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="4.5">birth defects in babies and there was a</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="5.25">congressional research service report</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="5.25">and various sound scientific papers that</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="5.101">concluded the following there is</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="5.85">absolutely no sane reason for the scary</text>
  <text start="465.8" dur="6.75">headlines and a panic they caused the</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="6.75">virus is harmless it is possible but</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="4.44">seems for now very unlikely that affects</text>
  <text start="475.1" dur="6.539">some unborn children there&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="10.14">no reason to be concerned about it the</text>
  <text start="481.639" dur="9.991">use of the insecticides most likely that</text>
  <text start="487.13" dur="7.5">is what has caused the problems in</text>
  <text start="491.63" dur="6.38">Brazil because they&amp;#39;re not seeing it</text>
  <text start="494.63" dur="6.18">throughout the other countries and we</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="5.95">all said this from the beginning that</text>
  <text start="500.81" dur="4.919">this was a complete hoax just like Ebola</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="5.91">that was supposed to spread through the</text>
  <text start="505.729" dur="6.481">United States which it didn&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.68">the CDC they came up these incredible</text>
  <text start="512.21" dur="3.93">computer models which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="3.51">ridiculous we can say oh one person is</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="4.319">infected multiplied by a factor of ten</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="5.039">and let it just run off and they can say</text>
  <text start="520.459" dur="4.021">you know by doing this the compound</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="2.811">effect shows us that six months from now</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="3.54">with their six million people infected</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="5.14">which doesn&amp;#39;t tell you anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="7.439">just a ridiculous computer model Zika</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="8.76">virus the Ebola virus the swine flu all</text>
  <text start="535.459" dur="8.521">of this stuff is to allow Big Pharma to</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="7.98">create vaccines to receive funding</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="7.56">period that&amp;#39;s what this is all about and</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="5.7">once again our government lied the</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="3.27">propagandas falling apart now the</text>
  <text start="553.49" dur="5.3">corporate media is trying to backtrack</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="7.23">trying to save face on what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="7.45">spewing out there and we can see right</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="8.28">now that this whole entire scam once</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="6.66">again was concocted by the government</text>
  <text start="570.32" dur="5.31">which lies to the people because the</text>
  <text start="572.9" dur="7.14">ndaa and a certain section or a writer</text>
  <text start="575.63" dur="6.05">allows the US government prop to use</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="3.5">propaganda on</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="4.17">people they don&amp;#39;t need proof they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="5.609">have to back it up with facts all they</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="8.16">have to do is lie and according to them</text>
  <text start="589.149" dur="7.491">it&amp;#39;s completely legal until we call them</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="5.16">out on it and we say show us some proof</text>
  <text start="596.64" dur="5.92">that&amp;#39;s where their propaganda always</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="5.97">falls apart and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="8.149">that corporations and the government</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="11.15">they have melded into one which is then</text>
  <text start="610.709" dur="8.801">fascism we are in a fascistic country</text>

  <text start="1184.08" dur="5.34">corporate media they don&amp;#39;t report on</text>
  <text start="1186.03" dur="7.529">that we see Russia right now they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1193.559" dur="7.591">like Armenia Belarus Kyrgyzstan</text>

  <text start="1209.79" dur="4.83">going to push war we see Israeli</text>
  <text start="1212.76" dur="5.16">warplanes they&amp;#39;re conducting mock</text>

  <text start="1239.16" dur="6.66">practicing these mock airstrikes what is</text>
  <text start="1243.57" dur="4.95">being planned and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1245.82" dur="4.44">something big is being planned right now</text>
  <text start="1248.52" dur="4.71">because we&amp;#39;re getting warnings</text>
  <text start="1250.26" dur="7.11">from the United States travel advisories</text>
  <text start="1253.23" dur="7.26">into Turkey we know the Islamic state is</text>

  <text start="1260.49" dur="4.08">into raka then at rocca to Aleppo of</text>

  <text start="1264.57" dur="5.19">up as the Islamic state because that</text>
  <text start="1266.25" dur="5.01">will allow Russia to bomb them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1269.76" dur="3.09">going to be showing up as the moderate</text>
  <text start="1271.26" dur="5.01">rebels but they need to make a stop at</text>
  <text start="1272.85" dur="6.45">rocca first and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1276.27" dur="6.03">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="1279.3" dur="5.76">central bankers they&amp;#39;re planning to have</text>
  <text start="1282.3" dur="5.16">a major offensive in raka because what</text>
  <text start="1285.06" dur="4.8">they want to do is they want to take the</text>
  <text start="1287.46" dur="3.96">Islamic state morph them into the</text>
  <text start="1289.86" dur="4.44">moderate rebels and say the moderate</text>
  <text start="1291.42" dur="6.12">rebels own this area when the other</text>
  <text start="1294.3" dur="6.27">Islamic state soldiers paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1297.54" dur="4.59">reach Rocca they can morph them into the</text>
  <text start="1300.57" dur="8.55">moderate rebels and then they can move</text>
  <text start="1302.13" dur="9.9">them towards Aleppo we see the carrier</text>
  <text start="1309.12" dur="6.9">battle group from Russia they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1312.03" dur="7.5">we have never planned to stop in the</text>
  <text start="1316.02" dur="5.9">Spanish port of sweta they never filed a</text>

  <text start="1328.67" dur="6.07">completely made up it was a good</text>
  <text start="1331.32" dur="7.53">propaganda piece and we can see NATO</text>
  <text start="1334.74" dur="5.61">used it to their advantage we see right</text>
  <text start="1338.85" dur="3.93">now the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1340.35" dur="6.69">bankers are trying to blame Russia for</text>
  <text start="1342.78" dur="7.37">bombing a school in Syria that killed 22</text>
  <text start="1347.04" dur="5.79">children and six teachers in it lib and</text>
  <text start="1350.15" dur="5.23">Russia is completely denying this and</text>
  <text start="1352.83" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re saying well prove it can we see</text>
  <text start="1355.38" dur="4.53">the radar information and we know that</text>
  <text start="1357.12" dur="4.92">NATO has there a wax planes flying</text>
  <text start="1359.91" dur="3.84">around this area keeping track of</text>
  <text start="1362.04" dur="4.47">everything we know the United States has</text>
  <text start="1363.75" dur="4.68">their satellites right above watching</text>
  <text start="1366.51" dur="4.05">every single move that&amp;#39;s happening there</text>
  <text start="1368.43" dur="5.37">and the United States can&amp;#39;t provide</text>
  <text start="1370.56" dur="5.55">anything and Russia is saying that</text>
  <text start="1373.8" dur="5.52">Syrian jets and Russian Jets weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1376.11" dur="6.9">even flying in that area so most likely</text>
  <text start="1379.32" dur="4.62">as we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past this is</text>
  <text start="1383.01" dur="2.85">another prop again</text>
  <text start="1383.94" dur="3.869">peace and most likely it was the</text>
  <text start="1385.86" dur="5.549">coalition forces and as soon as they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1387.809" dur="7.98">done it they blamed Russia to make their</text>

  <text start="1395.789" dur="4.47">them off the Human Rights Council and we</text>
  <text start="1398.37" dur="4.409">can see how this game is played and</text>
  <text start="1400.259" dur="4.681">actually when you look at Syria and</text>
  <text start="1402.779" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s happening Russia has been</text>
  <text start="1404.94" dur="6.15">bringing in humanitarian aid the United</text>

  <text start="1453.33" dur="4.92">the wounded and everyone else to leave</text>
  <text start="1455.49" dur="5.149">so they can go after those terrorists so</text>
  <text start="1458.25" dur="4.379">they have no one else to hide behind and</text>
  <text start="1460.639" dur="4.811">of course the terrorists are trying to</text>
