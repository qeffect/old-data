  <text start="218.55" dur="5.4">exact thing more and more people are</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="6.29">getting laid off it&amp;#39;s harder to find</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="6.27">good-paying jobs and the cost of living</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="6.01">continually goes up even though they</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="6.6">tell us no it&amp;#39;s not going up everything</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="6.47">is fine we&amp;#39;re in a deflationary period</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="6.96">but every time I go to the market food</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="8.34">continually goes up even with the</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="7.2">suppression of gas prices I would expect</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="5.98">the price of food would come way down</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="6.15">because when we had that jolt of gas</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="5.49">prices going up I saw food prices go up</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="5.909">but it seems that they&amp;#39;re not bringing</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.47">the food prices down it seems that</text>
  <text start="263.039" dur="3.571">they&amp;#39;re keeping them steady they came</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="2.73">down a little bit but now they&amp;#39;re steady</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.2">and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="6.57">to see them go right back up because the</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="4.98">value of the dollar is decreasing and</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="5.37">everyone to survive we see more and more</text>
  <text start="278.699" dur="8.69">companies here in the US they are laying</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="10.02">off people Ericsson 2,200 people Amgen</text>

  <text start="291.18" dur="5.4">announce layoffs they&amp;#39;re doing a</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="6">complete restructuring and we see many</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="6.83">many companies have been laying off and</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="6.45">again where are they going to find work</text>
  <text start="303.41" dur="4.3">where are they going to find the same</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.77">jobs with the same pay it is very</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="4.74">difficult out there many people have</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="3.9">been writing in saying listen I have a</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.14">job right now and I&amp;#39;ve been putting out</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="5.37">a resume and it is very difficult to</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="5.67">find that job especially at the same pay</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="5.91">a lot of the jobs and anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="4.95">coming back it&amp;#39;s for lower pay and the</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="2.91">question is why would I switch so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="3.39">going to stay on the job that I have</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="3.72">right now and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="4.08">people are getting laid off and they</text>
  <text start="332.16" dur="5.19">can&amp;#39;t find that same job because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="6.209">finding the same job maybe at lower pay</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="5.64">and it&amp;#39;s getting more and more difficult</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="5.181">and some people can&amp;#39;t even find that job</text>

  <text start="673.78" dur="5.79">us that this economy cannot survive</text>
  <text start="676.57" dur="3.75">because if we wait longer and longer and</text>

  <text start="745.9" dur="5.16">the event this is when they say okay we</text>
  <text start="748.72" dur="5.22">need something to get into this war to</text>
  <text start="751.06" dur="4.62">blame it on someone else and we can see</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="6.39">we are heading in that direction and it</text>
  <text start="755.68" dur="7.53">is getting closer and closer and sooner</text>
  <text start="760.33" dur="4.86">or later we will see this happen because</text>
  <text start="763.21" dur="3.75">as we can see from what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="765.19" dur="4.71">around the world and inside the new US</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="5.37">Canada Australia things are just getting</text>
  <text start="769.9" dur="4.38">worse not better they can tell us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.33" dur="4.91">getting better but when we continually</text>
  <text start="774.28" dur="7.56">look at all of this we can see it is not</text>
  <text start="777.24" dur="6.1">now as we know the United States has a</text>
  <text start="781.84" dur="3.81">plunge Protection Team and a</text>
  <text start="783.34" dur="3.87">high-frequency trading team and they</text>
  <text start="785.65" dur="4.11">keep the market up if they see it</text>
  <text start="787.21" dur="5.22">dropping down they step in they purchase</text>
  <text start="789.76" dur="4.41">stocks to keep the market going to make</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="3.96">sure it doesn&amp;#39;t come down and if things</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="4.28">get really really bad they have kill</text>
  <text start="796.39" dur="4.13">switches in place</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="4.71">so just in case there is some type of an</text>
  <text start="800.52" dur="4.62">event like a cyberattack where they have</text>
  <text start="803.16" dur="4.32">to show that another country or a group</text>
  <text start="805.14" dur="4.41">brought down the economy they have the</text>

  <text start="811.44" dur="5.31">on NASDAQ on the stock exchange and the</text>
  <text start="814.29" dur="5.96">Baths system and we can see that Japan</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="6.39">has the same exact thing and Japan</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="5.08">basically stepped in a stunning a</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="5.13">hundred and forty three times to buy</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="6.21">stocks to prevent the market from</text>
  <text start="828.27" dur="5.85">dropping and we can see the Bank of</text>

  <text start="848.25" dur="3.87">major stock indexes and you can see that</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="3.78">all these countries needed to put this</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="5.19">in place because of the way the</text>
  <text start="854.58" dur="5.04">economies are the stock market is not a</text>
  <text start="857.31" dur="5.19">representation of what is going on with</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="5.37">companies with the economy it is a</text>
  <text start="862.5" dur="5.16">manipulated area where the central</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="4.92">bankers are trying to show us with their</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="4.17">illusion that everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="4.59">this is why they have all of this in</text>

  <text start="878.34" dur="4.35">apart everything has been falling apart</text>
  <text start="880.26" dur="4.08">previous to this because we&amp;#39;re looking</text>

  <text start="884.34" dur="4.5">the illusionary numbers they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="6.87">us and we see that yeah this is not</text>

  <text start="892.41" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re telling us but they want all</text>
  <text start="895.14" dur="5.07">eyes on the market and when that comes</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="5.52">down then they&amp;#39;ll say oh look yeah the</text>
  <text start="900.21" dur="5.25">economy has broken as it&amp;#39;s fallen apart</text>
  <text start="903" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re in a collapse but they want the</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="4.98">market to come down when they can blame</text>
  <text start="907.62" dur="4.85">it on another group or country and this</text>
  <text start="910.44" dur="7.77">is why they&amp;#39;re manipulating it&amp;#39;s so hard</text>
  <text start="912.47" dur="8.74">every day to keep it where it is we see</text>
  <text start="918.21" dur="5.4">that OPEC right now is going to keep the</text>
  <text start="921.21" dur="5.49">production of oil at 30 million barrels</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="6.45">a day and their next meeting is not</text>
  <text start="926.7" dur="5.25">until June 5th so right now it makes</text>
  <text start="930.06" dur="3.75">complete sense the demand is very</text>
  <text start="931.95" dur="6.06">low so they&amp;#39;re going to increase</text>
  <text start="933.81" dur="5.87">production to bring down oil prices now</text>
  <text start="938.01" dur="4.02">it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="939.68" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose and the</text>
  <text start="942.03" dur="4.92">instructions of the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="4.98">put pressure on Russia they&amp;#39;re placing</text>

  <text start="953.46" dur="7.74">Venezuela Brazil Argentina you name it</text>
  <text start="957.27" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to foster regime change</text>
  <text start="961.2" dur="4.02">in these countries so the people rise up</text>
  <text start="963.51" dur="4.56">and say we can&amp;#39;t take it anymore</text>
  <text start="965.22" dur="4.74">the economies are falling apart they</text>
  <text start="968.07" dur="4.2">also tried to use this oppression of oil</text>
  <text start="969.96" dur="4.26">to spur economic growth here in the</text>
  <text start="972.27" dur="4.92">United States but actually it had the</text>
  <text start="974.22" dur="6.53">opposite effect people didn&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="977.19" dur="6.57">spend their money we see HSBC is</text>
  <text start="980.75" dur="6.73">allegedly closing all seven of its</text>
  <text start="983.76" dur="4.37">Lunden gold vaults why would they do</text>
  <text start="987.48" dur="2.76">this</text>
  <text start="988.13" dur="5.83">well there&amp;#39;s some rumors out there</text>
  <text start="990.24" dur="5.31">saying that all the GLD contracts that</text>
  <text start="993.96" dur="4.95">they have out there they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="995.55" dur="4.92">enough gold in these vaults to cover it</text>
  <text start="998.91" dur="3.45">so they want to get out of the business</text>
  <text start="1000.47" dur="5.07">right now because there&amp;#39;s not enough in</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="5.13">there and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1005.54" dur="4.92">not saying that there are vaults there</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="6.51">their safety deposit box so don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="1010.46" dur="6.72">about it and of course we understand</text>
  <text start="1014" dur="5.19">that HSBC is under the watchful eye of</text>
  <text start="1017.18" dur="4.38">everyone because they&amp;#39;ve been laundering</text>

  <text start="1021.56" dur="9.96">taxes they&amp;#39;re also been laundering money</text>

  <text start="1031.52" dur="5.16">at by many different angles here and we</text>
  <text start="1034.459" dur="3.811">can see they&amp;#39;re in the mode of</text>
  <text start="1036.68" dur="4.019">protecting themselves because they</text>
  <text start="1038.27" dur="5.64">realized the entire system is collapsing</text>
  <text start="1040.699" dur="7.111">and they&amp;#39;re getting into hot water now</text>
  <text start="1043.91" dur="5.49">something very interesting the united</text>
  <text start="1047.81" dur="4.02">states government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1049.4" dur="4.74">have been putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="1051.83" dur="4.83">Russia with sanctions with oil</text>
  <text start="1054.14" dur="4.65">suppression and Russia and trying to</text>
  <text start="1056.66" dur="4.74">decide you know what we need to step</text>
  <text start="1058.79" dur="4.38">away from the private western central</text>
  <text start="1061.4" dur="3.54">bank countries we need to start our own</text>

  <text start="1071.059" dur="5.041">testing it right now and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1072.74" dur="5.85">to go live later in this year and we see</text>
  <text start="1076.1" dur="6.439">the US government would love to kick out</text>
  <text start="1078.59" dur="8.79">Russia from the Swift system but again</text>
  <text start="1082.539" dur="6.461">things don&amp;#39;t go as planned as the</text>

  <text start="1089" dur="9.419">always go the way they want it things</text>
  <text start="1093.13" dur="6.73">sometimes backfire and the US government</text>
  <text start="1098.419" dur="4.981">has been doing everything it can to</text>
  <text start="1099.86" dur="6.6">topito the Russian economy and we can</text>
  <text start="1103.4" dur="5.61">see that they the the thing they want to</text>
  <text start="1106.46" dur="5.64">do is they want to push them out of the</text>
  <text start="1109.01" dur="6.27">Swiss system but there&amp;#39;s a problem there</text>
  <text start="1112.1" dur="8.04">would be a boomerang effect on Europe</text>
  <text start="1115.28" dur="8.009">and the United States and many other</text>
  <text start="1120.14" dur="10.83">nations but swift decided to do the</text>
  <text start="1123.289" dur="12.87">opposite they decided to basically give</text>
  <text start="1130.97" dur="7.53">them a seat on the board now the there</text>
  <text start="1136.159" dur="4.65">are about 25 available board seats and</text>

  <text start="1149.99" dur="7.83">and of course most countries don&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="1152.539" dur="7.411">any seats at all well Monday they looked</text>
  <text start="1157.82" dur="3.51">at Russia they looked at mmm they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1159.95" dur="3.06">going to remove themselves from the</text>
  <text start="1161.33" dur="4.8">Swift system the Swift is going to lose</text>
  <text start="1163.01" dur="5.64">a lot of money so basically what they</text>
  <text start="1166.13" dur="3.45">did the opposite of what the US</text>
  <text start="1168.65" dur="3.24">government wants</text>
  <text start="1169.58" dur="7.2">they gave him they gave them a seat on</text>
  <text start="1171.89" dur="8.01">the board and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="1176.78" dur="6.899">central bankers must be very angry at</text>
  <text start="1179.9" dur="5.88">this they&amp;#39;re trying to stop Russia from</text>
  <text start="1183.679" dur="3.781">using their own payment system do I</text>
  <text start="1185.78" dur="2.46">think it&amp;#39;s going to stop them most</text>
  <text start="1187.46" dur="3.18">likely not</text>
  <text start="1188.24" dur="4.95">I think Russia and China are going to</text>
  <text start="1190.64" dur="4.919">move forward with their payment systems</text>
  <text start="1193.19" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;re going to slowly remove</text>

  <text start="1198.59" dur="2.309">it&amp;#39;s more its</text>
