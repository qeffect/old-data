  <text start="80.09" dur="5.27">geopolitical news now as we&amp;#39;ve noticed</text>
  <text start="82.61" dur="5.67">things have been getting really chaotic</text>
  <text start="85.36" dur="6.28">in the u.s. we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="88.28" dur="6.18">shootings many of these false flag</text>
  <text start="91.64" dur="4.979">shootings the individual might be a</text>
  <text start="94.46" dur="5.73">veteran might have been in the armed</text>
  <text start="96.619" dur="6.991">forces at one time and we knew at some</text>
  <text start="100.19" dur="6.36">point they were going to target the</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="7.429">veterans because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="106.55" dur="7.04">something very unbelievable</text>
  <text start="111.039" dur="5.11">constitutional attorney Michael Connelly</text>
  <text start="113.59" dur="5.35">he&amp;#39;s also the executive director of the</text>
  <text start="116.149" dur="4.89">United States Justice foundation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.94" dur="4.679">written an article outrageous veterans</text>
  <text start="121.039" dur="4.47">are now receiving letters prohibiting</text>
  <text start="123.619" dur="5.73">the purchased possession receipt or</text>
  <text start="125.509" dur="6.601">transport of firearm ammunition now</text>
  <text start="129.349" dur="4.89">according to Connelly veterans are</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="4.56">receiving this letter from the US</text>
  <text start="134.239" dur="6.801">Department of Veterans Affairs which</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="7.289">states a determination in competency</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.73">will prohibit you from purchasing</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="6.421">possessing receiving or transporting a</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="6.4">firearm or ammunition if you knowingly</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="5.1">violate any of these prohibitions you</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="4.14">may be fined imprisoned or both pursuant</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="6.05">to the brady handgun Violence Prevention</text>
  <text start="157.31" dur="7.02">Act publication number 103 159 as</text>
  <text start="161.53" dur="8.47">implemented at 18 united states code</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="8.54">92 for a 2 it seems as if the VA has</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.95">taken another tact of dealing with</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="6.67">neutralizing veterans apparently by</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="8.79">denying then due process and this is</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="8.67">what attorney Connolly is saying because</text>
  <text start="183.74" dur="7.86">in every state in the United States no</text>
  <text start="188.21" dur="5.16">one can be declared incompetent to</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="4.65">administer their own affairs without due</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="5.46">process of law and that usually requires</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="4.47">a judicial hearing with evidence being</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="4.74">offered to prove to a judge that a</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="4.89">person is indeed incompetent this is a</text>
  <text start="203.57" dur="4.44">requirement of the fifth amendment to</text>
  <text start="205.61" dur="4.349">the u.s. constitution that states no</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="3.96">person shall be deprived of life liberty</text>
  <text start="209.959" dur="4.801">and property without due process of law</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="4.22">and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re just sending this letter home</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="4.75">saying that if you violate this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="4.32">in trouble and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="4.56">using the tact where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="3.96">listen we&amp;#39;re going to target these</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="4.65">veterans because we know they know how</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="6.26">to use these weapons their military</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="7.65">trained and this is another way of</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.95">keeping the weapons out of those people</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="7.38">which they fear the most and that is the</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="7.589">veterans because as we can see as this</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="4.41">economy continually deteriorates I mean</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="3.841">it all revolves around this everything</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="3.81">the US government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="5.46">are doing revolves around the economy</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="5.73">completely falling apart because they</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="3.99">know once it falls apart there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="4.32">to be riots people are going to be angry</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="4.62">people are going to be pissed off people</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="4.4">are going to get their weapons their</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="6.12">pitchforks their knives well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="7.09">ar-15s their handguns but you get the</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="5.31">picture it&amp;#39;s always the same we the</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="3.93">weapons might be more advanced now but</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="4.98">this is what they&amp;#39;re afraid of they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="5.66">afraid of the people going and saying</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="6.66">listen we&amp;#39;re done with this government</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="7.48">it&amp;#39;s time for you to step down this is</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="5.64">what they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this is what</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re afraid of and you can see</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="4.59">to</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="4.32">get the weapons away from the people</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="6">especially those who really know how to</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="5.94">use them now out in the UK the UK</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="4.5">government has publicly admitted that</text>
  <text start="307.97" dur="5.58">parts of the investigatory powers bill</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="6">the IP be better known as the snoopers</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="7.56">charter would allow it to force</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="7.26">companies to ban and n encryption now</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="5.67">this is a huge assault on public on the</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="5.94">public&amp;#39;s privacy not to mention digital</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="4.74">security so the government would ask</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="3.9">internet &amp;amp; communication service</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="3.87">providers to develop and maintain a</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="3.39">technical capability to remove</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="4.77">encryption that has been applied to</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="4.95">communications or data this will leave</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="5.54">the public at risk not to mention</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="7.74">setting a supremely dangerous precedent</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="5.83">now why are they doing this well they</text>
  <text start="349.79" dur="4.17">can&amp;#39;t spy on the people with encryption</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="5.04">they can&amp;#39;t break it if they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="5.19">the method or the key there in the dark</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.38">this is the problem this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="4.11">doing this this is why the US wants to</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="3.77">get rid of encryption and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="4.35">in the past and I&amp;#39;ll say it again</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="6.88">everyone needs to protect their</text>
  <text start="367.61" dur="6">information you protect your financial</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="3.69">records you put them in a safe you put</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="3.51">them in a safety deposit box well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.29" dur="3.72">something I wouldn&amp;#39;t do but you keep it</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="4.05">very close to you you lock up your house</text>
  <text start="379.01" dur="4.77">to keep your valuables safe you lock</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="4.92">your car so nobody steals it same thing</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="5.16">with electronic information most of the</text>
  <text start="386.09" dur="6.96">things that we do today are electronic</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="7.11">so we need keys we need locks and that</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="5.67">is encryption and we need to use</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="4.53">encryption we need to lock our</text>
  <text start="398.72" dur="6.39">information up if they want to see it</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="6.42">guess what they need a warrant but</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s not the whole point of this the</text>
  <text start="407" dur="6.33">whole point of this is they want it so</text>
  <text start="408.98" dur="8.34">they can spy on everyone now you can use</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="7.2">email encryption to hide your emails you</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="5.28">can use this encryption code that</text>
  <text start="420.53" dur="3.63">someone wrote it&amp;#39;s on the x 22 report</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="5.52">com site you can encrypt any math</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="5.82">message and send someone the key you can</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="3.06">protect your phone by using block at</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="3.15">pocket calm</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="5.519">say sleeve that you can slip your phone</text>
  <text start="433.13" dur="5.28">into it&amp;#39;s intertwined with different</text>
  <text start="436.699" dur="3.84">metals to block the signal you can slip</text>
  <text start="438.41" dur="5.16">your credit cards into different sleeves</text>
  <text start="440.539" dur="4.35">to block the signal from the credit</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="2.939">cards because a lot of these cars are</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="3.75">coming with those chips and people</text>
  <text start="446.509" dur="3.66">walking by but scanners can read the</text>
  <text start="448.639" dur="4.201">information and this blocks the signal</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="4.171">so whatever you&amp;#39;re doing you need to</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="2.97">continually protect yourself just like</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="4.26">you lock up your car you lock up your</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="7.53">house you lock up your private</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="8.01">information in a safe and this will show</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="6.77">the government&amp;#39;s that no no we want our</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="8.97">privacy we don&amp;#39;t want you to spy on us</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="9.279">now out in Iraq we see over 1 million</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="9.089">people or more have died since the</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="10.221">invasion of Iraq now of course this</text>
  <text start="484.669" dur="7.891">entire report is coming from the</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="5.65">physicians for Social Responsibility it</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.25">is a 2015 report because government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="4.939">just they don&amp;#39;t have any idea how many</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="5.849">people have died or how many civilians</text>
  <text start="500.199" dur="7.541">have died or how many children have died</text>
  <text start="503.659" dur="10.62">since these wars have started and all of</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="8.609">this was done for paper and ink it was</text>
  <text start="514.279" dur="6">all done to keep the central banking</text>
  <text start="516.349" dur="12.091">system up and running to keep them very</text>
  <text start="520.279" dur="11.941">wealthy to keep them in control so they</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="7.74">don&amp;#39;t care how many people die for their</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="8.22">cause to keep them in the one-percent</text>
  <text start="536.18" dur="8.58">range or even higher now out in right in</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="7.95">Iraq we see the u.s. they&amp;#39;re signing</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="8.91">agreements with the Iraqi Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="8.639">region and they&amp;#39;ve signed agreements to</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="6.39">establish five US military bases in the</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="5.161">region and we can see these are going to</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="4.82">be set up throughout the Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="6.2">Region and we can see what their plan</text>
  <text start="564.88" dur="5.27">right now because as we know going back</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="5.16">some time which we&amp;#39;ve discussed before</text>
  <text start="570.15" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re planning to separate the Middle</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="6.09">East into the Kurds the Shiite Sunni the</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="5.94">ala whites and if you notice the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="9.27">continually working with the Kurds</text>
  <text start="582.37" dur="10.4">setting up their own kind of sector</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="6.33">which will then be their own country and</text>
  <text start="592.77" dur="5.41">we can see they&amp;#39;re doing this in Syria</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re doing this in Iraq and most</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="2.91">likely they&amp;#39;re going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="5.16">throughout the other countries because</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="8.37">as we can see they&amp;#39;re losing control of</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="8.03">the Middle East right now now fifty</text>
  <text start="609.46" dur="5.76">percent of the Syrian refugees in Turkey</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re willing to return</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="5.16">home once the situation calms down and</text>
  <text start="617.98" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re able to return they would like</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="4.98">to return home they don&amp;#39;t want to stay</text>
  <text start="621.94" dur="5.81">in Turkey they want their home back just</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="5.34">like any of us would want our homes back</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="4.87">so we can see right now fifty percent</text>
  <text start="630.7" dur="5.91">are already saying I am ready to return</text>
  <text start="632.62" dur="6.96">home but of course they can&amp;#39;t because we</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="6.93">have the u.s. the coalition forces in</text>
  <text start="639.58" dur="8.01">Syria making it very difficult for the</text>
  <text start="643.54" dur="8.4">people now out in Turkey we understand</text>
  <text start="647.59" dur="6.51">the coup is done with Iran is running</text>
  <text start="651.94" dur="4.83">around the country getting rid of a lot</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="5.82">of people but we see in the Incirlik Air</text>
  <text start="656.77" dur="4.23">Base that power is still cut for four</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="3.09">days right now they&amp;#39;re running on</text>
  <text start="661" dur="7.95">generators and they can run everything</text>
  <text start="663.01" dur="9.03">on the generators now in this base this</text>
  <text start="668.95" dur="6.81">is where they ran all the missions to</text>
  <text start="672.04" dur="5.97">hit the Islamic state and the base</text>
  <text start="675.76" dur="3.78">continues to be resupplied and there is</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="5.22">sufficient fuel to carry out the</text>
  <text start="679.54" dur="5.43">missions and they&amp;#39;re not running any</text>
  <text start="683.23" dur="3.09">type of shortage of food or water</text>
  <text start="684.97" dur="3.62">there&amp;#39;s no rationing or anything like</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="5.31">that so the base is still operational</text>
  <text start="688.59" dur="4.9">the power is just out and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="3.93">generators now why haven&amp;#39;t they turned</text>
  <text start="693.49" dur="4.29">the power on don&amp;#39;t know at this point</text>
  <text start="695.56" dur="3.07">but we&amp;#39;ll watch that situation very</text>
  <text start="697.78" dur="5.05">carefully</text>
  <text start="698.63" dur="7.29">we can see that erna one he is getting</text>
  <text start="702.83" dur="6.06">rid of everyone everyone that opposes</text>
  <text start="705.92" dur="6.45">him or might be a threat to him he is</text>
  <text start="708.89" dur="7.65">cracking down and getting rid of we see</text>
  <text start="712.37" dur="8.12">that 21,000 private school teachers they</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="7.08">just canceled their licenses we see that</text>

  <text start="796.19" dur="6.3">Obama is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>

  <text start="818.59" dur="8.04">understand and continue with democracy</text>
  <text start="823.39" dur="7.69">because this is crucial for an economic</text>

  <text start="831.08" dur="7.23">economy going south</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="8.07">in Turkey and when we look at all of</text>
  <text start="838.31" dur="4.8">this this whole entire coup which we</text>
  <text start="840.62" dur="6.719">discussed before in yesterday&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="843.11" dur="7.02">on the weekend we see different</text>
  <text start="847.339" dur="4.701">anomalies in what is happening now many</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="4.59">people have different theories and</text>
  <text start="852.04" dur="5.5">people are saying that turkey is now</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="6.15">siding with Russia the u.s. didn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="7.169">this this is why they decided to have</text>
  <text start="860.87" dur="6.6">the coup well that is one theory another</text>
  <text start="864.709" dur="8.281">theory is that ur to one did this all</text>
  <text start="867.47" dur="9.27">himself another one is that the US did</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="8.4">this with Berta one and still another</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="9.68">that this isn&amp;#39;t even the coup this was a</text>
  <text start="881.39" dur="7.259">trial run and the real coup is coming</text>
  <text start="886.42" dur="5.71">now these are a lot of different</text>
  <text start="888.649" dur="8.071">theories but what we can see right now</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="7.949">is that Iran is cleaning house and the</text>
  <text start="896.72" dur="5.7">individual that was in charge of the</text>
  <text start="900.079" dur="6.771">campaign against the Islamic state he</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="6.539">was found dead he was shot in the neck</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="6.46">which is very interesting because we</text>
  <text start="908.959" dur="8.661">have to remember the United States UK</text>
  <text start="913.31" dur="8.219">Israel turkey Saudi Arabia Qatar</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="6.25">coalition forces they were involved in</text>
  <text start="921.529" dur="4.711">creating the Islamic state they funded</text>
  <text start="923.87" dur="4.26">them they set up the infrastructure to</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="4.289">make sure they brought in revenue to</text>
  <text start="928.13" dur="4.74">support their operations berta one</text>
  <text start="930.529" dur="5.43">allowed them easy access in and out of</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="5.04">Turkey even Israel on the southern</text>
  <text start="935.959" dur="5.19">border of Syria allowed the Islamic</text>
  <text start="937.91" dur="6.72">state to move in and out then Putin came</text>
  <text start="941.149" dur="6.18">out after burdwan had the Russian jet</text>
  <text start="944.63" dur="5.85">shot down and pointed out that her</text>
  <text start="947.329" dur="6.841">dhawan has ties to the Islamic state he</text>
  <text start="950.48" dur="6.299">was trading with them buying the oil his</text>
  <text start="954.17" dur="5.13">son Ashley Bulow was handling all of</text>
  <text start="956.779" dur="5.911">that and you have to remember what Irwin</text>
  <text start="959.3" dur="5.19">said that if anyone can prove that he</text>
  <text start="962.69" dur="3.21">has been purchasing the oil from the</text>
  <text start="964.49" dur="5.61">Islamic state</text>
  <text start="965.9" dur="8.19">would resign very interesting now the</text>
  <text start="970.1" dur="6.57">question is why is all of this happening</text>
  <text start="974.09" dur="5.91">and I know I&amp;#39;ve said this many times but</text>
  <text start="976.67" dur="9.81">we have to remember that the United</text>
  <text start="980" dur="11.25">States and NATO they wanted Turkey to</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="8.01">change their constitution so by removing</text>
  <text start="991.25" dur="5.7">thousands of judges prosecutors from the</text>
  <text start="994.49" dur="5.43">judiciary system and bringing the death</text>
  <text start="996.95" dur="6.45">penalty back speaks of some hidden</text>
  <text start="999.92" dur="6.15">agenda IRDA one wanted to change the</text>
  <text start="1003.4" dur="4.2">country constitution but failed to do it</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="5.79">to the lack of parliamentary majority</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="8.64">and we can see that he might be on his</text>
  <text start="1011.86" dur="10.59">way in changing the Constitution giving</text>
  <text start="1016.24" dur="9.99">him full power now WikiLeaks they were</text>
  <text start="1022.45" dur="6.72">hit by hackers after they de said they</text>
  <text start="1026.23" dur="7.26">were going to release a lot of turkey</text>

  <text start="1033.49" dur="5.31">political power structure in Turkey now</text>
  <text start="1037.089" dur="5.301">they don&amp;#39;t know where these attacks come</text>
  <text start="1038.8" dur="6.57">from they can&amp;#39;t track them down and</text>
  <text start="1042.39" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re looking to release the first</text>

  <text start="1048.91" dur="8.52">emails and 500,000 documents with and</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="8.88">this is going to explain the entire</text>
  <text start="1057.43" dur="5.7">power structure in Turkey and so far we</text>
  <text start="1062.11" dur="3.93">haven&amp;#39;t seen this and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1063.13" dur="5.88">watch that very carefully the turkish</text>
  <text start="1066.04" dur="5.55">naval ships and choppers are still</text>
  <text start="1069.01" dur="4.59">missing the Navy is saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1071.59" dur="5.85">missing about 14 ships two helicopters</text>
  <text start="1073.6" dur="8.34">with 25 Special Forces troops they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1088.15" dur="6.45">saying they&amp;#39;re all accounted for so we</text>
  <text start="1090.58" dur="6.11">have a discrepancy there irda one is out</text>
  <text start="1094.6" dur="4.709">there saying that this entire coup is</text>
  <text start="1096.69" dur="5.53">like a terrorist attack</text>
  <text start="1099.309" dur="6.151">we know what IRDA one has done before he</text>
  <text start="1102.22" dur="5.339">set up many different false flags he</text>
  <text start="1105.46" dur="6.539">shut down Twitter he shut down you two</text>
  <text start="1107.559" dur="8.521">when he was caught and with all these</text>
  <text start="1111.999" dur="8.371">different theories we have to wonder who</text>
  <text start="1116.08" dur="6.469">benefits from this coup well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1120.37" dur="5.549">starting to look like Earth one it</text>
  <text start="1122.549" dur="7.691">starting look like he is benefiting from</text>
  <text start="1125.919" dur="6.45">all of this it looks like NATO is going</text>
  <text start="1130.24" dur="6.72">to benefit it looks like the United</text>
  <text start="1132.369" dur="8.961">States will benefit if they can control</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="9.539">irda one and give him ultimate power and</text>
  <text start="1141.33" dur="8.289">he can do whatever he wants without his</text>

  <text start="1149.619" dur="8.64">something the u.s. NATO will have a</text>
  <text start="1154.09" dur="7.049">country a force that will do pretty much</text>
  <text start="1158.259" dur="5.49">anything and we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="1161.139" dur="9.63">Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve lost their footing</text>
  <text start="1163.749" dur="10.231">in Iraq and Syria and the u.s. turkey</text>
  <text start="1170.769" dur="6.421">the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1173.98" dur="6.86">their proxy army and they have two</text>
  <text start="1177.19" dur="7.199">choices now either do something or</text>
  <text start="1180.84" dur="7.179">continue to work with Russia and come up</text>
  <text start="1184.389" dur="5.581">with some type of ceasefire peace</text>
  <text start="1188.019" dur="5.54">agreement which is not going to benefit</text>
  <text start="1189.97" dur="9.02">the u.s. turkey coalition forces at all</text>
  <text start="1193.559" dur="9.421">now while looking at this entire coup</text>
  <text start="1198.99" dur="8.919">certain things actually stick out now</text>
  <text start="1202.98" dur="10.299">back in March 29th of 2016 what did the</text>
  <text start="1207.909" dur="9.6">US do they ordered diplomatic military</text>
  <text start="1213.279" dur="8.34">families out of South turkey told them</text>
  <text start="1217.509" dur="6.9">to get out of Turkey all the military</text>
  <text start="1221.619" dur="5.28">families in the Incirlik base they</text>
  <text start="1224.409" dur="6.691">needed to remove themselves very</text>
  <text start="1226.899" dur="6.631">interesting just recently in June of 27</text>
  <text start="1231.1" dur="5.16">2016 Rue de Wanda side</text>
  <text start="1233.53" dur="6.5">to apologize to Putin over the death of</text>
  <text start="1236.26" dur="6.6">the Russian pilot now I know their</text>
  <text start="1240.03" dur="7.45">theory that turkey is getting closer to</text>
  <text start="1242.86" dur="6.84">Russia maybe turkey is but then we would</text>
  <text start="1247.48" dur="6.69">have to see the actions of Turkey if we</text>
  <text start="1249.7" dur="7.35">see turkey moving closer to Russia will</text>
  <text start="1254.17" dur="5.16">see more deals you&amp;#39;ll see them pull away</text>
  <text start="1257.05" dur="7.88">from the United States will see them get</text>
  <text start="1259.33" dur="10.65">closer to Iran and we&amp;#39;ll see them remove</text>
  <text start="1264.93" dur="8.56">the US forces from Turkey they will stop</text>
  <text start="1269.98" dur="7.02">the bombings in Syria he will not let</text>
  <text start="1273.49" dur="5.91">them use the base that is something that</text>
  <text start="1277" dur="4.47">will tell us that he&amp;#39;s getting closer to</text>
  <text start="1279.4" dur="4.92">Russia but it&amp;#39;s very interesting that</text>
  <text start="1281.47" dur="6.26">the u.s. decided to remove their</text>
  <text start="1284.32" dur="7.5">personnel back in March and Erna one</text>
  <text start="1287.73" dur="8.35">apologized in June so the u.s. already</text>
  <text start="1291.82" dur="7.53">had this planned because they knew</text>
  <text start="1296.08" dur="7.68">exactly what was happening and from this</text>
  <text start="1299.35" dur="10.56">coup that&amp;#39;s so amateurish it only</text>
  <text start="1303.76" dur="8.7">benefited her one the US and NATO it</text>
  <text start="1309.91" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t really help Iran at this point it</text>
  <text start="1312.46" dur="5.01">didn&amp;#39;t really help Syria at this point</text>
  <text start="1314.62" dur="4.68">it didn&amp;#39;t really help Russia at this</text>
  <text start="1317.47" dur="6.05">point the only way it&amp;#39;s going to help</text>
  <text start="1319.3" dur="7.02">them is if her one follows through and</text>
  <text start="1323.52" dur="4.51">tells the u.s. to get out you can&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="1326.32" dur="4.62">the coalition forces you cannot use our</text>
  <text start="1328.03" dur="6.18">base to bomb Syria and this is something</text>
  <text start="1330.94" dur="9.05">that we need to watch now the other</text>
  <text start="1334.21" dur="9.95">theory is that this coup was a trial run</text>
  <text start="1339.99" dur="8.92">well er dhawan right now is purging</text>
  <text start="1344.16" dur="9.13">generals judges teachers government</text>
  <text start="1348.91" dur="7.71">officials pretty much everyone if this</text>
  <text start="1353.29" dur="7.35">was the pre coup it didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1356.62" dur="7.77">backing of the people the real coup</text>
  <text start="1360.64" dur="5.97">would have to have the military which is</text>
  <text start="1364.39" dur="2.79">being purged right now and it would have</text>
  <text start="1366.61" dur="2.97">to have the</text>
  <text start="1367.18" dur="4.7">backing of the people so i don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1369.58" dur="4.47">that theory holds water at this point</text>
  <text start="1371.88" dur="4.75">but we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch the</text>
  <text start="1374.05" dur="6.75">entire situation i do believe that the</text>
  <text start="1376.63" dur="9.57">US and Turkey they were come they had</text>
  <text start="1380.8" dur="10.11">combined effort into having this fake</text>
  <text start="1386.2" dur="7.89">type of coup to allow her one to gain as</text>
  <text start="1390.91" dur="7.5">much power as possible for the next</text>
  <text start="1394.09" dur="7.89">phase of the operation but again we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1398.41" dur="5.55">have to watch and see remember we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1401.98" dur="5.94">looking at indicators there&amp;#39;s no crystal</text>
  <text start="1403.96" dur="7.32">bowl here now in Germany we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1407.92" dur="5.76">another Islamic state attack and of</text>
  <text start="1411.28" dur="6">course this time the man was using an</text>
  <text start="1413.68" dur="5.34">axe and does that mean that people have</text>
  <text start="1417.28" dur="3.9">to have a 15 day waiting period or a</text>
  <text start="1419.02" dur="3.96">five-day waiting period they have to</text>
  <text start="1421.18" dur="4.11">have a background check to use an axe</text>
  <text start="1422.98" dur="4.86">because if you really look at it all</text>
  <text start="1425.29" dur="5.64">these different false flags at this</text>
  <text start="1427.84" dur="4.74">point one guy&amp;#39;s using a truck and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1430.93" dur="5.48">proved that he was not part of the</text>
  <text start="1432.58" dur="9.57">Islamic state but now a truck is a</text>
  <text start="1436.41" dur="8.83">weapon we see an axe is a weapon are</text>
  <text start="1442.15" dur="6.39">they blaming it on the truck are they</text>
  <text start="1445.24" dur="6.93">blaming it on the axe no they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="1448.54" dur="6.54">it on the people only when it&amp;#39;s a gun do</text>
  <text start="1452.17" dur="6.03">they blame it on the gun not the people</text>
  <text start="1455.08" dur="5.25">and they go after the gun how can they</text>
  <text start="1458.2" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t go after the truck everyone you</text>
  <text start="1460.33" dur="5.34">cannot have a truck everyone cannot have</text>
  <text start="1462.16" dur="5.52">an axe we need to take it away if you</text>

  <text start="1467.68" dur="6.48">water but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1470.25" dur="7">that their continued continually using</text>
