  <text start="121.789" dur="6">into office his entire mission the</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="5.88">Patriots mission was to bring all the</text>

  <text start="151.31" dur="5.46">central bank they do not give in that</text>
  <text start="154.13" dur="5.24">easily we know that they will fight</text>
  <text start="156.77" dur="6.21">until the very end right now Trump</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="4.589">controls the economic narrative we know</text>

  <text start="174.159" dur="9.06">and their last chance is coming up and</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="8.289">the only way right now is either to have</text>
  <text start="183.219" dur="8.6">a candidate that can go up against Trump</text>
  <text start="187.269" dur="9.87">or take away the economic narrative and</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="8.5">somehow someway collapse the system and</text>
  <text start="197.139" dur="6.93">this brings me back to Facebook&amp;#39;s Libra</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="6.03">this is a cryptocurrency coin and now</text>
  <text start="204.069" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;m not saying that cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="206.349" dur="5.09">bad out of the hands of the central</text>
  <text start="209.349" dur="5.37">bankers where it&amp;#39;s centralized</text>
  <text start="211.439" dur="5.83">cryptocurrencies fantastic just like</text>
  <text start="214.719" dur="4.38">with fiat if the people controlled and</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="4.411">we created our own currency with no</text>
  <text start="219.099" dur="6.241">interest attached and there was checks</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="6.809">and balances the fiat currency would be</text>
  <text start="225.34" dur="5.7">fine in the hands of the central bankers</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="5.521">the private west central bankers that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="6.9">where the problem lies now we know that</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="7.5">Facebook they are now pushing Libre and</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="6.539">this is a problem the heart of this</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="6.449">Libre project is the lever Association</text>
  <text start="244.479" dur="6.6">the non governmental Association based</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="6.27">in Geneva Switzerland is supported by</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="6.981">founding members such as eBay Facebook</text>
  <text start="254.229" dur="7.26">MasterCard PayPal Spotify uber Visa as</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="5.079">well as other renowned firms and will be</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="4.981">responsible for the operation and</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="6.481">further development of Libre now</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="6.09">Libre will be created by participants</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="5.34">depositing fiat currencies such as US</text>
  <text start="272.56" dur="6.3">dollars or Euros with the Libre</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="5.69">association the Libre association will</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="4.529">then grant the depositors a</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="7.87">corresponding Libra amount in a digital</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="8.221">wallet which then can be used to pay for</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="7.5">things via the internet smartphone</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="6">credit card or whatsapp Facebook and</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="5.369">since mastic</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="7.38">and visa are part of this you&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="301.389" dur="7.321">to pay for things in stores that are</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="5.1">online and maybe actually pay for them</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="5.609">when you go to the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="8.94">stores now think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="314.319" dur="6.69">of what is happening traditional banks</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="7.05">right now are a little worried about</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="8.551">this because those individuals will</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="5.94">siphon their funds out of the banking</text>
  <text start="329.56" dur="5.039">system and into the Liebherr Association</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.1">Facebook now what happens if Facebook</text>
  <text start="334.599" dur="4.081">bans you what happens if they say you</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="3.84">know something we don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="4.109">doing on Facebook and we have a problem</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="5.459">with this so we&amp;#39;re gonna stop you from</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="7.771">purchasing or something like that but as</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="7.171">people drain the banks and move their</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="6.719">fiat currency into Facebook&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="7.439">Libre which is basically electronic fiat</text>
  <text start="357.279" dur="7.591">currency this is going to have an effect</text>
  <text start="361.029" dur="7.44">on the economy what happens when people</text>
  <text start="364.87" dur="8.759">stop using the dollar remember 70% of</text>
  <text start="368.469" dur="9.48">GDP is the dollar which means the</text>
  <text start="373.629" dur="6.451">economy would have problems I mean let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="3.601">take for example if someone just came up</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="3.36">with another fiat currency and says you</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="5.609">know don&amp;#39;t use the dollar anymore use</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="6.029">this instead everything that&amp;#39;s based on</text>
  <text start="387.159" dur="4.531">the Fiat dollar which is the Federal</text>
  <text start="389.469" dur="3.51">Reserve Note that would come to a</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="7.219">screeching halt because everyone be</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="8.55">using another currency the entire system</text>
  <text start="398.909" dur="7.06">would come to a screeching halt we would</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="8.82">enter a crisis and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.969" dur="6.991">looking to do Libre is just a Fiat money</text>
  <text start="410.349" dur="4.56">clone just like fiat currencies a Libra</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="4.949">is fake money it&amp;#39;s gonna be backed by</text>
  <text start="414.909" dur="5.701">nothing we don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s a cap</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.741">to how much they can create yes they</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="3.929">might tell us something but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="4.53">mean that&amp;#39;s actually what it is also</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="6.451">it&amp;#39;s kind of centralized someone is</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="8.67">controlling this it&amp;#39;s not free and open</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="8.04">and every time corporations central</text>
  <text start="435.85" dur="8.31">banks control something this is where</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="7.14">the people do not benefit and we can see</text>
  <text start="444.16" dur="5">why they&amp;#39;re pushing this very very hard</text>
  <text start="446.17" dur="7.92">they want to control the economic</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="7.42">narrative here in this country and we</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="5.85">understand that Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="6.81">cannot allow this to happen now when we</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="7.56">look at the economy right now the</text>
  <text start="463.39" dur="5.73">central bank economy is failing I mean</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.66">if you look at any statistics if you</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="3.69">look at anything besides the stock</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="2.85">market and the manipulated GDP</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="2.96">unemployment numbers I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="474.01" dur="4.77">going over this for many many years</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="5.41">nothing&amp;#39;s really changed it&amp;#39;s just that</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="4.17">Trump has the magic wand and he is</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="4.89">putting the economy into overdrive</text>
  <text start="482.95" dur="4.53">he needs to because he needs to keep the</text>
  <text start="486.07" dur="3.9">deep state the central bank the</text>
  <text start="487.48" dur="5.4">mainstream media off his back about the</text>
  <text start="489.97" dur="5.01">economy he needs to control that because</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="3.75">when he can when you control the</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="3.66">narrative the economy and people are</text>
  <text start="496.63" dur="4.32">feeling good and you putting out message</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="3.84">that everything is great well you have a</text>
  <text start="500.95" dur="3.9">better chance of being reelected and</text>
  <text start="502.48" dur="6.33">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing and this is why</text>
  <text start="504.85" dur="6.9">he is pushing the Fed to lower interest</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="3.96">rates as quickly as possible because</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="3.75">when we look at many different</text>
  <text start="512.77" dur="4.59">indicators everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="4.5">fall apart and we knew that this was</text>
  <text start="517.36" dur="5.07">going to happen we knew that there was</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.04">going to be a point in time where the</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="4.35">system would not be able to go for it</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="3.81">actually it&amp;#39;s way past that point and</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="5.46">the only thing that&amp;#39;s keeping alive is</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="6.6">rate cuts and stimulus you need to feed</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="7.62">the junkie and this is what Trump is</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="6.3">trying to do now Williams came out and</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="4.17">this is fed Williams from New York fed</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="6.51">and he said that the fed would deliver a</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="7.08">50 BP rate cut that the market so Depp</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="5.55">desperately craves and then he walked</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.86">this back now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="553.81" dur="5.4">remember there are good guys and bad</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="6.15">guys in the Fed Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="559.21" dur="4.8">following because of the faulty thought</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="2.67">process we have going for us at the</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="2.85">Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="4.77">we pay much higher interest rates and</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.8">countries that are no match for us</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="4.44">economically in other words our interest</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="4.5">costs are much higher than other</text>
  <text start="574" dur="3.33">countries when they should be lower</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="4.29">correct</text>
  <text start="577.33" dur="5.01">he continued I like New York Fed</text>
  <text start="580.45" dur="4.47">President John Williams first statement</text>
  <text start="582.34" dur="5.19">much better than his second his first</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="5.36">statement is 100% correct and that the</text>
  <text start="587.53" dur="5.67">Fed raised far too fast and too early</text>
  <text start="590.28" dur="5.62">also must stop with crazy quantitative</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="5.43">tightening we&amp;#39;re in a world competition</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="4.89">and winning big but it is no thanks to</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="4.74">the Federal Reserve had they not acted</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="4.98">so fast and so much would be doing even</text>
  <text start="603.37" dur="4.35">better than we&amp;#39;re doing right now this</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="4.23">is our chance to build unparalleled</text>
  <text start="607.72" dur="4.89">wealth and success for the US growth</text>
  <text start="610" dur="3.96">which would greatly reduce percent debt</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t blow it</text>
  <text start="613.96" dur="6.6">and he went on to say fed there is</text>
  <text start="617.59" dur="5.88">almost no inflation now if we go back to</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="6.78">his first tweet which I find very</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="6.51">interesting is that he said his first</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="7.7">statement is 100% correct and that the</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="8.7">Fed raised far too fast and too early</text>
  <text start="635.04" dur="7.06">now Trump what he is saying right now is</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="6.6">yes we can raise rates but it was too</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="6.18">early which means once we have the</text>
  <text start="645.28" dur="4.74">proper growth once everything is back on</text>
  <text start="648.28" dur="5.07">track or when he wins the election in</text>
  <text start="650.02" dur="6.48">2020 then the Fed can start raising</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="5.7">rates think about what he&amp;#39;s saying right</text>
  <text start="656.5" dur="8.01">there and he&amp;#39;s calling out the Fed</text>
  <text start="659.05" dur="7.65">listen we need the rate cut right now we</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t wait any longer and I do believe</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="5.43">that the Fed is going to cut rates this</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="5.4">summer is it going to be in the by the</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="6.69">end of July or August we don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="675.13" dur="5.94">exact timing but we need it sooner than</text>
  <text start="678.82" dur="4.56">later because as we can see from the</text>
  <text start="681.07" dur="5.76">indicators things are really starting to</text>
  <text start="683.38" dur="6.9">fall apart and Trump needs to keep the</text>
  <text start="686.83" dur="5.25">system alive long enough for the</text>
  <text start="690.28" dur="4.11">election process now on the other side</text>
  <text start="692.08" dur="6.33">you have the central banks and the bad</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="7.23">guys where they don&amp;#39;t want the system</text>
  <text start="698.41" dur="6.27">to continually chug along they want it</text>
  <text start="701.62" dur="6.75">to come down this is why originally the</text>
  <text start="704.68" dur="5.22">Fed was raising rates because they knew</text>
  <text start="708.37" dur="3.57">if they raise rates and we&amp;#39;ve looked at</text>
  <text start="709.9" dur="4.32">this before back in 2008 and prior to</text>
  <text start="711.94" dur="4.41">this everything comes to a screeching</text>
  <text start="714.22" dur="4.62">halt because when you&amp;#39;re in an economic</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="5.61">illusion and it&amp;#39;s completely controlled</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s not a free market you can control</text>
  <text start="721.96" dur="4.98">what is happening right now and I do</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="4.44">believe that they&amp;#39;re fighting back with</text>
  <text start="726.94" dur="4.53">Facebook Libre they&amp;#39;re trying to fight</text>
  <text start="729.25" dur="5.67">back with the rate cuts but I still</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="6.18">believe that the Patriots are still in</text>
  <text start="734.92" dur="6.81">control and they will bring down the</text>
  <text start="737.65" dur="8.04">rates and like I said before yes there</text>
  <text start="741.73" dur="5.67">are certain Fed individuals that are on</text>
  <text start="745.69" dur="5.4">the good side and there are certain Fed</text>
  <text start="747.4" dur="6.06">officials that are on the bad side and I</text>
  <text start="751.09" dur="3.78">believe Fed Williams was out there</text>
  <text start="753.46" dur="4.17">saying yes we&amp;#39;re ready to cut and</text>
  <text start="754.87" dur="4.82">someone kind of stopped him and said no</text>
  <text start="757.63" dur="5.43">no you better retract what you said and</text>
  <text start="759.69" dur="4.78">I think Powell is also working with</text>
  <text start="763.06" dur="3.3">Trump even though he it continually</text>
  <text start="764.47" dur="4.53">attacks him just like he continually</text>
  <text start="766.36" dur="4.8">attacks sessions he&amp;#39;s doing exactly what</text>
  <text start="769" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s supposed to do and eventually what</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="4.2">I think is going to happen is that once</text>
  <text start="773.44" dur="6.33">he has and I&amp;#39;m talking about the Trump</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="7.44">has his nominees on the Fed board he</text>
  <text start="779.77" dur="6.39">might eventually have Powell resigned</text>
  <text start="782.8" dur="6.84">just like sessions and then allow</text>
  <text start="786.16" dur="5.78">another person to be placed as the Fed</text>
  <text start="789.64" dur="3.99">Chairman it could be Judy Shelton</text>
  <text start="791.94" dur="4.71">because think about it</text>
  <text start="793.63" dur="6.36">she likes sound money she likes gold and</text>
  <text start="796.65" dur="5.77">you can see how all of this could play</text>
  <text start="799.99" dur="7.08">out to the Patriots benefit to the</text>
  <text start="802.42" dur="7.56">people&amp;#39;s benefit and Trump he needs to</text>
  <text start="807.07" dur="6.21">keep this system going long enough to</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="5.73">allow all of this to happen and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="813.28" dur="5.45">watching the battle right now because</text>
  <text start="815.71" dur="7.23">we&amp;#39;re coming towards the end here</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="7.03">because we&amp;#39;re at a crossroads and we</text>
  <text start="822.94" dur="5.28">need the rates cut if they&amp;#39;re not cut</text>
  <text start="825.76" dur="4.89">and the rates start to rise the system</text>
  <text start="828.22" dur="4.11">completely falls apart and it collapses</text>
  <text start="830.65" dur="3.63">Trump of the Patriots know</text>
  <text start="832.33" dur="5.48">they can&amp;#39;t allow this to happen this is</text>
  <text start="834.28" dur="6.84">why Q came out and told us that watch</text>
  <text start="837.81" dur="6.01">the entire Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="5.7">to reverse course and they went into</text>
  <text start="843.82" dur="6">patient mode watch and see they stopped</text>
  <text start="846.82" dur="4.41">raising rates even though they were</text>
  <text start="849.82" dur="5.61">saying that they were gonna continually</text>
  <text start="851.23" dur="6.81">raise rates now they&amp;#39;re going to cut</text>
  <text start="855.43" dur="4.53">rates now it might be a small cut in the</text>
  <text start="858.04" dur="3.48">very beginning but I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="859.96" dur="2.31">to happen throughout the rest of this</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="3.12">year</text>
