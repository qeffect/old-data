  <text start="83.89" dur="3.81">out especially from the IMF where</text>

  <text start="140.049" dur="5.371">one-third of default by corporations in</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="4.441">all industries and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="145.42" dur="5.61">right now is that things are getting</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="5.82">actually worse as time goes on now again</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="4.86">tops friendly markets that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.93">supermarket chain and many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="5.55">buy their food over the Internet and</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="4.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="5.25">traffic is drying up at the malls</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.8">traffic at stores they are driving</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="4.799">drying up and a lot of people are saying</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="3.989">you know what I just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="171.489" dur="2.821">funds to go out and to purchase like I</text>
  <text start="173.829" dur="2.88">used to</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="4.83">now there was a time and we need to</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="4.981">remember how this all works there was a</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="5.01">time in the beginning of this fayed</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.65">system back in 1970s where everything</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="4.77">was just beginning</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="4.17">there was really no credit most of the</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="4.649">people back then only had maybe gas</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="5.16">cards they really didn&amp;#39;t have the credit</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="4.051">cards that we see today one of the first</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="4.26">was like mastercharge it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.77">called MasterCard a lot of people had</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="6.3">diners club and what has happened over</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="6.42">the period of time as credit as the</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="5.039">printing of money continued and the</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.819">devaluation of the dollar you had to</text>
  <text start="211.269" dur="4.951">move into a credit cycle and this is</text>
  <text start="214.629" dur="4.89">what we&amp;#39;ve been in for a very long time</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="5.94">where credit basically took over from</text>
  <text start="219.519" dur="6.47">people having the actual cash to go out</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="8.07">and spend now at the end of this system</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="6.25">what happens well people are up to their</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="4.44">eyeballs in debt now think about it go</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="4.051">back to the 80s because in the 70s were</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="4.8">coming off the gold standard moving on</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="5.699">to the petro dollar system where there</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.109">was a lot of inflation a lot of dollars</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="4.261">being printed the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="243.579" dur="5.761">was decreasing so we saw salaries move</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="6.269">up because of inflation we saw a housing</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="4.979">move up and in the 80s all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="3.541">at that point they were able to reduce</text>
  <text start="254.319" dur="4.081">the interest rates once that happened</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="3.66">they introduced credit cards they</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="2.61">introduced a lot of different things and</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="2.43">people were going out spending like</text>
  <text start="261.01" dur="3">crazy because they were spending money</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="4.62">they really didn&amp;#39;t have and that was</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="6.21">like the 80s where you had this credit</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.67">boom cycle and that was moving into the</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="4.41">90s also and then we had the housing</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="3.949">boom where more and more people were</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="4.38">able to purchase the houses and</text>
  <text start="276.389" dur="4.931">everything was growing this is how the</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="3.839">fayette system works so we at the</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="3.27">beginning stage where it was kind of</text>
  <text start="282.849" dur="4.051">tough middle stage which was pretty darn</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="4.56">good for a lot of people and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="5.21">at the end stage where the system</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="5.519">completely falls apart people</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="4.989">continually charged as much as they</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.22">possibly can because the salaries the</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="5.13">wages are declining and what happens is</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="5.521">it hits retail it hits the housing</text>
  <text start="302.229" dur="7.111">market it hits food restaurants and</text>
  <text start="305.41" dur="5.04">during the 80s the 90s early 2000s we</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="3.15">kept on building</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="4.08">let&amp;#39;s open more stores let&amp;#39;s keep going</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s you know have the internet sales</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="4.859">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just keep building as much</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="3.75">as we possibly can</text>
  <text start="319.389" dur="4.921">that was the build-out phase now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="5.31">in the contraction phase where a lot of</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="4.44">people can&amp;#39;t go out and purchase like</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="3.359">they used to they don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="3.599">they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="6.571">making the salary that&amp;#39;s where we are</text>
  <text start="332.349" dur="6.72">today we&amp;#39;re at the end of the cycle now</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="4.23">back to the IMF report they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="339.069" dur="4.141">that things are good right now</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="3.629">well really are they a lot of the</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="3.6">countries they have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="344.409" dur="4.32">austerity on the people unemployment is</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="4.56">to continually ticking up yes they they</text>
  <text start="348.729" dur="5.071">manipulate the calculations to make it</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="4.5">look good but if you remove all those</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="4.229">manipulative calculations what you</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="5.069">really see is unemployment is very very</text>
  <text start="358.029" dur="4.2">high and here in this country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.939" dur="5.641">saying the unemployment is anywhere from</text>
  <text start="362.229" dur="6.631">20 to 22% 23% and a lot of people who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="4.17">lost our positions they&amp;#39;ve got part-time</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="3.839">jobs and you have to remember what they</text>
  <text start="370.75" dur="5.009">did was you lost a full-time job got two</text>
  <text start="372.699" dur="6.27">part-time jobs it was one part one</text>
  <text start="375.759" dur="6.47">full-time job lost two full times gained</text>
  <text start="378.969" dur="6">even though you&amp;#39;re working part-time and</text>
  <text start="382.229" dur="6.101">the IMF came out with their financial</text>
  <text start="384.969" dur="6.391">stability report they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="5.699">numbers look good the global economic</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="6.149">growth is continually growing and they</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="6.36">said out in the future not too far off</text>
  <text start="397.509" dur="7.91">in distance because of Trump&amp;#39;s policies</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="8.81">of trade wars tariffs reciprocal taxes</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="8.62">slashing taxes they see problems now</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="7.83">this widening income inequality the IMF</text>
  <text start="414.039" dur="6.15">says that this has been exacerbated by</text>
  <text start="417.029" dur="6.31">technological advancements and it could</text>
  <text start="420.189" dur="5.671">lead to murad of problems down the road</text>
  <text start="423.339" dur="5.01">so you really think this is because of</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="5.16">technological advancements or do you</text>
  <text start="428.349" dur="5.49">think that there&amp;#39;s an income inequality</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="5.19">because basically those insiders those</text>
  <text start="433.839" dur="5.341">central bankers those on Wall Street</text>
  <text start="436.21" dur="4.5">they all have the inside track and the</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="3.87">rest of the people are sitting here</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="3.959">going what is going on here this is why</text>
  <text start="443.05" dur="4.289">the middle class is disappearing this is</text>
  <text start="444.669" dur="5.011">why the poor are getting poorer this is</text>
  <text start="447.339" dur="5.371">why the 1% is getting wealthier and</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re saying because of the</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="4.95">slashing of taxes because of the trade</text>
  <text start="455.14" dur="4.5">wars because of the tariffs we can see</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="4.68">that we&amp;#39;re going to have a huge amount</text>
  <text start="459.64" dur="5.34">of problems in the future and this is</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="5.16">all being blamed on what Trump has done</text>
  <text start="464.98" dur="5.28">up at to this point where he slashed</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="6.75">taxes there&amp;#39;s trade Wars and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.26" dur="6.6">saying as time goes on as we reach 2020</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re projecting out they&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="5.01">that things are going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="479.26" dur="4.62">worse as time goes on now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="4.14">trying to tell us is that everything</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="5.52">that Trump is doing is completely wrong</text>
  <text start="486.01" dur="6.36">what they were doing you know with</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="5.25">Greece and Cyprus and Italy and France</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="5.73">and you know pushing austerity on the</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="8.43">people making the government&amp;#39;s cut and</text>
  <text start="498.1" dur="6.9">slash and remove all the jobs and have</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="4.29">the people suffer on the street so their</text>
  <text start="505" dur="4.83">debt can be paid that is a better</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="6.44">solution remember central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="6.69">like to keep countries in limbo they</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="4.87">can&amp;#39;t get out of their debt problem but</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="5.45">the debt problem doesn&amp;#39;t sink them and</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="5.79">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing forever</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="4.84">the reason why they&amp;#39;re coming down on</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="4.41">Trump&amp;#39;s plan so hard is because whenever</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s a plan that counters the central</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.92">bank&amp;#39;s and actually makes the country do</text>
  <text start="532" dur="4.86">much much better than it really should</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="6.26">be doing under the central bank they</text>
  <text start="536.86" dur="7.08">don&amp;#39;t like this and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="5.77">Trump will be pushing to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="543.94" dur="3.78">central bank I mentioned this many times</text>
  <text start="545.83" dur="4.14">before where there&amp;#39;s Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="3.99">hanging on his wall and Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="549.97" dur="3.81">got rid of the central bank actually he</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="5.22">campaigned on getting rid of the central</text>
  <text start="553.78" dur="5.37">bank and I think eventually once</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.7">everything&amp;#39;s all said and done if the</text>
  <text start="559.15" dur="4.83">plan goes as planned the last step would</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="3.87">be getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="563.98" dur="5.28">because again the central bank is the</text>
  <text start="566.5" dur="4.59">cause of these problems around the world</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="4.17">and saying every single problem but</text>
  <text start="571.09" dur="5.64">putting nations into debt starting wars</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="6.12">and everything else all goes back to the</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="6.3">central bank and there&amp;#39;s no reason we</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="6.96">need a private corporation loaning</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="6.12">government&amp;#39;s currency with interest at</text>
  <text start="586.51" dur="5.43">matched where the people then have to</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="5.67">pay taxes you have to give up your</text>
  <text start="591.94" dur="4.26">hard-earned money and give it to the</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="3.72">central bank because that&amp;#39;s really where</text>
  <text start="596.2" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s going it&amp;#39;s not going to help the</text>
  <text start="598.54" dur="4.41">government you&amp;#39;re paying the interest on</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="4.17">the debt because the government</text>
  <text start="602.95" dur="4.2">continually needs to borrow borrow</text>
  <text start="604.69" dur="5.88">because there&amp;#39;s no system put into place</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="6">to say hey you can&amp;#39;t borrow anymore yeah</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="4.23">the debt ceiling is a waste of time I</text>
  <text start="613.15" dur="3.75">mean look what they have to do oh yeah</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll just vote to raise it a little bit</text>
  <text start="616.9" dur="4.65">more oh well they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="5.94">forever the checks the system that</text>
  <text start="621.55" dur="4.26">should be put into place to say okay we</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="3.54">can&amp;#39;t borrow from anyone because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.81" dur="3.72">no one to borrow from this is what we</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="3.72">have so guess what we can&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="629.53" dur="3.96">program we can&amp;#39;t do this program it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="3.21">almost like your household you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="3.33">bringing in a certain amount of money</text>
  <text start="634.78" dur="5.07">you know how much money you have and</text>
  <text start="636.82" dur="5.01">guess what you can&amp;#39;t do these certain</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="4.32">things now if you&amp;#39;re given a credit card</text>
  <text start="641.83" dur="5.04">well all of a sudden you can do a lot</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="6.27">more but there&amp;#39;s interest attached and</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="5.16">your salary is gonna go for it to pay</text>
  <text start="650.44" dur="4.35">off that interest on that credit card</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="5.19">and as you keep borrowing you get deeper</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="5.49">and deeper into debt and as time goes on</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="4.32">the situation gets out of hand well this</text>
  <text start="660.28" dur="2.97">is what&amp;#39;s been happening in this country</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="6.39">for a very long time this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.25" dur="8.63">in the trillions in debt not a million</text>
  <text start="667.93" dur="6.06">not a billion but trillions 20 trillion</text>
  <text start="671.88" dur="4">actually it&amp;#39;s a lot higher than that</text>
  <text start="673.99" dur="3.75">because if you count the unfunded</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="4.56">liabilities and everything else it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="677.74" dur="4.92">much much much higher than that and this</text>
  <text start="680.44" dur="4.56">is because the government the government</text>
  <text start="682.66" dur="4.29">officials who have special interest</text>
  <text start="685" dur="4.53">groups they don&amp;#39;t really care I mean</text>
  <text start="686.95" dur="7.17">look they put together a spending bill</text>
  <text start="689.53" dur="5.69">of over a trillion dollars I mean where</text>
  <text start="694.12" dur="4.2">is this coming from</text>
  <text start="695.22" dur="5.05">yeah they&amp;#39;re gonna borrow it and then</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re gonna say oh we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="700.27" dur="5.07">enough tax receipts coming in to pay for</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="4.11">the interest on this so we have to keep</text>
  <text start="705.34" dur="4.68">the interest for every low and the</text>
  <text start="707.77" dur="4.35">interest moves up guess what it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="710.02" dur="4.35">over this is why you&amp;#39;re not seeing it</text>
  <text start="712.12" dur="3.3">happen and if they do continually raise</text>
  <text start="714.37" dur="3.09">the interest rates which they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="715.42" dur="3.52">very slowly guess what happens to the</text>
  <text start="717.46" dur="6.49">entire system it</text>
  <text start="718.94" dur="8.28">Rush&amp;#39;s this system is not designed to be</text>
  <text start="723.95" dur="6.18">a benefit to the people this system is</text>
  <text start="727.22" dur="6.51">designed to benefit the central bank in</text>
  <text start="730.13" dur="7.32">every single way because no matter what</text>
  <text start="733.73" dur="8.28">happens guess what their debt obligation</text>
  <text start="737.45" dur="6.48">doesn&amp;#39;t go away the people still owe the</text>
  <text start="742.01" dur="3.57">central bank unless of course the</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="3.09">President or someone says you know what</text>
  <text start="745.58" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re just getting rid of this where</text>
  <text start="747.02" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re gonna pay off the original note to</text>
  <text start="749.75" dur="2.67">the central bank and we&amp;#39;re getting rid</text>
  <text start="751.16" dur="3.48">of it and all this debt is made up</text>
  <text start="752.42" dur="4.91">anyhow we don&amp;#39;t have to pay it but at</text>
  <text start="754.64" dur="5.19">this point with the government officials</text>
  <text start="757.33" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;re intertwined with the central</text>
  <text start="759.83" dur="3.54">bank and I think what Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="761.51" dur="4.2">do eventually because he realizes what</text>
  <text start="763.37" dur="3.72">is happening here he&amp;#39;s a businessman and</text>
  <text start="765.71" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s Patriots behind him looking at</text>
  <text start="767.09" dur="5.31">this saying yeah we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="769.28" dur="6.75">the central bank Andrew Jackson saw this</text>
  <text start="772.4" dur="7.05">and said yeah we don&amp;#39;t need this type of</text>
  <text start="776.03" dur="7.53">system the founding fathers warned us of</text>
  <text start="779.45" dur="6.27">this and of course in 1913 well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="783.56" dur="4.16">when the central bank was once again</text>
  <text start="785.72" dur="4.41">brought into the United States under the</text>
  <text start="787.72" dur="3.82">Federal Reserve name which made it seem</text>
  <text start="790.13" dur="4.2">like it was part of the government and</text>
  <text start="791.54" dur="5.67">it was all a ruse to enslave the people</text>
  <text start="794.33" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s really you&amp;#39;re a slave in this</text>
  <text start="797.21" dur="3.63">system think about it you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="5.04">every day and you&amp;#39;re giving a portion of</text>
  <text start="800.84" dur="5.1">your hard earned earned work your</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="5.94">currency that you&amp;#39;re receiving off to a</text>
  <text start="805.94" dur="5.07">central bank you&amp;#39;re paying the</text>
  <text start="809.57" dur="3.96">government and the government has to pay</text>
  <text start="811.01" dur="5.85">back the central bank because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.53" dur="4.65">interest attached so you&amp;#39;re working for</text>
  <text start="816.86" dur="3">the central bank this is why it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="5.28">a Federal Reserve Note it&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="819.86" dur="5.99">a US Treasury bill it&amp;#39;s a Federal</text>
  <text start="823.46" dur="5.67">Reserve Note it&amp;#39;s an instrument of debt</text>
  <text start="825.85" dur="7.05">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="829.13" dur="7.13">the IMF is worried the Fed is worried</text>
  <text start="832.9" dur="9.45">because what he&amp;#39;s doing right now is</text>
  <text start="836.26" dur="9.25">he&amp;#39;s pushing to destroy the central bank</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="5.77">economy not the people&amp;#39;s economy this is</text>
  <text start="845.51" dur="5.579">the central bank&amp;#39;s economy and don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="848.12" dur="4.32">confused when I do when I say destroy I</text>
  <text start="851.089" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t mean just bring it down</text>
  <text start="852.44" dur="5.52">we started I mean get rid of it the</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="4.59">central bank well they&amp;#39;d like to bring</text>
  <text start="857.96" dur="3.96">the economy down because they make money</text>
  <text start="859.97" dur="3.48">when the economy&amp;#39;s up when it&amp;#39;s down it</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t really make a difference they</text>
  <text start="863.45" dur="2.55">want to bring it down so they can</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="3.21">restart it again</text>
  <text start="866" dur="4.8">and the central bank the way they do it</text>
  <text start="868.37" dur="4.23">is they make it seem like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="3.54">really doing anything to affect the</text>
  <text start="872.6" dur="3.57">economy they&amp;#39;re bringing the interest</text>
  <text start="874.34" dur="4.62">rates up very very slowly everything</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="5.1">looks great and they know what happens</text>
  <text start="878.96" dur="4.53">each time they bring the interest rates</text>
  <text start="881.27" dur="4.44">up the economy starts to buckle under</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="3.3">the weight things start to go south and</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="2.82">then they start bringing the interest</text>
  <text start="886.79" dur="3.75">rates down again but it&amp;#39;s a chain</text>
  <text start="888.53" dur="4.17">reaction and they know this and by the</text>
  <text start="890.54" dur="3.33">time the economy comes down they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="892.7" dur="2.79">bringing the interest rates down and</text>
  <text start="893.87" dur="4.44">they can say we had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="895.49" dur="4.5">this it wasn&amp;#39;t our fault but there might</text>
  <text start="898.31" dur="3.78">be something else that brings it down</text>
  <text start="899.99" dur="5.82">because there&amp;#39;s so many black swans out</text>
  <text start="902.09" dur="8.33">there the LIBOR rate is continually</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="8.01">increasing every single month or so and</text>
  <text start="910.42" dur="5.77">since the beginning until now since they</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="3.95">brought the rates down it has increased</text>
  <text start="916.19" dur="5.67">them what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="917.77" dur="7.36">is that the US Fed Funds rate the LIBOR</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="4.95">rates they that first of all it stands</text>
  <text start="925.13" dur="3.36">for the London interbank offered rate</text>
  <text start="926.81" dur="3.87">which is an important benchmark interest</text>
  <text start="928.49" dur="5.34">rate that is used for price loans across</text>
  <text start="930.68" dur="5.55">the globe when the library library is</text>
  <text start="933.83" dur="6.24">low it means that loans are inexpensive</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="5.82">and vice versa and with the US Fed Funds</text>
  <text start="940.07" dur="4.86">rate the library eights were cut to</text>
  <text start="942.05" dur="5.76">record low levels during the 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="944.93" dur="5.76">financial crisis in order to encourage</text>
  <text start="947.81" dur="4.61">more borrowing and you know economic</text>
  <text start="950.69" dur="4.86">growth and things like that</text>
  <text start="952.42" dur="4.72">unfortunately economic booms that are</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="3.95">created via the central bank</text>
  <text start="957.14" dur="5.61">manipulation a borrowing course are</text>
  <text start="959.5" dur="5.52">typically temporary bubble booms rather</text>
  <text start="962.75" dur="5.79">than sustainable organic economic booms</text>
  <text start="965.02" dur="6.36">when central banks raise borrowing costs</text>
  <text start="968.54" dur="5.52">as an economic cycle matures the growth</text>
  <text start="971.38" dur="4.47">driving bubbles pop leading to a bear</text>
  <text start="974.06" dur="4.89">market financial crisis and recession</text>
  <text start="975.85" dur="5.62">when you look at the library and you</text>
  <text start="978.95" dur="4.71">look at the chart you can see the</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="3.63">historic bubbles where they are formed</text>
  <text start="983.66" dur="6.11">during those</text>
  <text start="985.1" dur="8.01">LIBOR rates and as the rate moves up</text>
  <text start="989.77" dur="6.4">guess what happens all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="993.11" dur="9.03">bubble pops and we saw this in the chart</text>
  <text start="996.17" dur="8.31">matches up to the 2007-2008 crisis we</text>
  <text start="1002.14" dur="7.56">see it going back to the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="1004.48" dur="9.78">in 2001 we see it going back to the 1990</text>
  <text start="1009.7" dur="6.84">to 1991 crisis there I mean each time it</text>
  <text start="1014.26" dur="4.91">correlates with what has happened with</text>
  <text start="1016.54" dur="7.74">LIBOR so we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1019.17" dur="7.39">indicators letting us know that problems</text>
  <text start="1024.28" dur="4.38">are headed our way now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1026.56" dur="5.16">interesting is that there are many</text>
  <text start="1028.66" dur="5.52">countries now dumping Treasuries China</text>
  <text start="1031.72" dur="4.8">decided not to purchase anymore they</text>
  <text start="1034.18" dur="4.71">were dumping we see Japan they are</text>
  <text start="1036.52" dur="5.79">dumping their Treasuries and Russia the</text>
  <text start="1038.89" dur="5.88">Central Bank of Russia has sold 3.1</text>
  <text start="1042.31" dur="5.04">billion in US Treasury bills as of</text>
  <text start="1044.77" dur="4.02">February reducing its investment in</text>
  <text start="1047.35" dur="4.14">American debt to the lowest level since</text>
  <text start="1048.79" dur="5.61">March of last year and they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="1051.49" dur="5.97">to dump even more now the question is</text>
  <text start="1054.4" dur="5.75">was this part of the plan because we can</text>
  <text start="1057.46" dur="5.52">see that Trump is working with China</text>
  <text start="1060.15" dur="6.73">working with with China on the trade</text>
  <text start="1062.98" dur="6.51">deals and building and creating</text>
  <text start="1066.88" dur="5.51">everything for the new economy</text>
  <text start="1069.49" dur="4.08">in the meantime countries are dumping</text>
  <text start="1072.39" dur="4.18">Treasuries</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s already explaining to the country</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="4.68">into the world that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="1078.25" dur="5.4">they are basically devaluing their</text>
  <text start="1081.25" dur="5.34">currency and it looks like he might be</text>
  <text start="1083.65" dur="4.2">they might be pushing a currency war</text>
  <text start="1086.59" dur="4.47">where he&amp;#39;s going to devalue the dollar</text>
  <text start="1087.85" dur="5.67">and maybe have the dollar crash because</text>
  <text start="1091.06" dur="4.8">we know that the central banks they have</text>
  <text start="1093.52" dur="3.75">to raise interest rates during this</text>
  <text start="1095.86" dur="3.9">period of time and we know what happens</text>
  <text start="1097.27" dur="4.05">when they raise interest rates well they</text>
  <text start="1099.76" dur="3.33">keep raising it until the economy</text>
  <text start="1101.32" dur="4.11">buckles under the weight and then they</text>
  <text start="1103.09" dur="4.2">start lowering it but it&amp;#39;s too late we</text>
  <text start="1105.43" dur="3.45">mentioned that before and the economy</text>
  <text start="1107.29" dur="5.37">comes down so what do we see here we see</text>
  <text start="1108.88" dur="5.61">the library moving up moving up moving</text>
  <text start="1112.66" dur="5.55">up and we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern there</text>
  <text start="1114.49" dur="4.5">where every time it it is brought to the</text>
  <text start="1118.21" dur="2.88">lowest point</text>
  <text start="1118.99" dur="4.65">starts moving up like this the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="5.88">come down when the Fed raises their</text>
  <text start="1123.64" dur="5.669">rates during a low interest rate type of</text>
  <text start="1126.97" dur="5.58">period of time they bring the economy</text>
  <text start="1129.309" dur="4.891">down and it looks like Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="1132.55" dur="3.69">the agenda to do the same thing and to</text>
  <text start="1134.2" dur="4.729">force the central bank into doing this</text>
  <text start="1136.24" dur="5.37">now he needs to control the narrative of</text>
  <text start="1138.929" dur="3.371">when this system comes down any</text>
  <text start="1141.61" dur="2.4">complaint</text>
  <text start="1142.3" dur="4.47">neither finger at the central bank</text>
  <text start="1144.01" dur="4.44">saying listen we have proof we know they</text>
  <text start="1146.77" dur="3.36">raised the rates the LIBOR rate was</text>
  <text start="1148.45" dur="2.91">going up people were dumping the</text>
  <text start="1150.13" dur="3.96">Treasuries the interest rates were</text>
  <text start="1151.36" dur="7.11">moving up and that brought down the</text>
  <text start="1154.09" dur="6.42">economy stock mark came down jobs are</text>
  <text start="1158.47" dur="4.05">being lost maybe we should look into the</text>
  <text start="1160.51" dur="6.38">feds affairs maybe we should audit the</text>
  <text start="1162.52" dur="4.37">Fed and he can start this type of</text>
  <text start="1167.55" dur="6.25">investigation into what the Fed has done</text>
  <text start="1170.26" dur="6.419">if he can build the case just like the</text>
  <text start="1173.8" dur="4.8">case against Facebook which QED did</text>
  <text start="1176.679" dur="3.961">mention that this was going to come out</text>
  <text start="1178.6" dur="4.23">and it did come out just like when Trump</text>
  <text start="1180.64" dur="4.52">mentioned Obama was spying on him and</text>
  <text start="1182.83" dur="5.28">all of a sudden now we have this FISA</text>
  <text start="1185.16" dur="5.83">investigation going on all he has to do</text>
  <text start="1188.11" dur="4.83">is the same exact thing with the central</text>
  <text start="1190.99" dur="3.75">bank mention it saying I think</text>
  <text start="1192.94" dur="2.13">something&amp;#39;s going on with the central</text>
  <text start="1194.74" dur="2.85">bank</text>
  <text start="1195.07" dur="5.01">I think they caused this by raising</text>
  <text start="1197.59" dur="5.04">interest rates by manipulating and all</text>
  <text start="1200.08" dur="4.229">of a sudden Congress and those people</text>
  <text start="1202.63" dur="3.84">that have been pushing and audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="1204.309" dur="4.141">bill might say hey let&amp;#39;s push this again</text>
  <text start="1206.47" dur="4.14">and it might go through you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1208.45" dur="3.93">going to sign it and this might be the</text>
  <text start="1210.61" dur="4.17">start of auditing the Fed it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="1212.38" dur="4.56">simple once you get everything into</text>
