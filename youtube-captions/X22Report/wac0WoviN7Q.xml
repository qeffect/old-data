  <text start="68.64" dur="5.43">point to an event on the horizon let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.79" dur="5.07">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="5.43">and geopolitical news now since Trump</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="6.149">became president it looks like the</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="6.84">corporate media the deep state they have</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="5.101">a problem with immigration now we need</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="3.48">to understand there&amp;#39;s two different</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="4.23">things going on here one there is</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.07">immigration and then we have the term</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.08">illegal immigrant and it looks like</text>
  <text start="93.89" dur="6.399">they&amp;#39;re trying to combine the two and</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="6.059">they&amp;#39;re not the same at all yes the</text>
  <text start="100.289" dur="4.681">United States accepts immigrants they go</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="4.681">through a process they&amp;#39;re vetted they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="5.13">allowed into the country illegal</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="5.34">immigrants well they sneak over the</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="6.18">border they hide in the country and</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re here illegally Obama basically</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="5.19">he took those individuals who made it</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="3.119">across the border said okay they can</text>
  <text start="121.47" dur="3.719">stay in the country set up sanctuary</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="4.68">cities and transported these individuals</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="4.651">to different areas now the illegal</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="5.131">immigrants they were being used for many</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="5.399">different agendas Trump became president</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="7.11">and he said listen we need to stop this</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="6.81">and this has to be stopped because again</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="3.75">if we don&amp;#39;t what&amp;#39;s the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="142.049" dur="3.871">border so let&amp;#39;s just let everyone in</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="4.77">criminals drug dealers and makes no</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="5.25">difference and if everyone feels this</text>
  <text start="148.38" dur="4.98">way leave your door open and accept</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="6.21">anyone into your house because think</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="6.719">about this you have a home and you have</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="4.919">a border which is your door someone</text>
  <text start="160.079" dur="3.961">knocks on your door you either look</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="4.741">through the peephole or you open it a</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.37">crack and say who are you and if you</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="4.83">trust them by vetting them asking them</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="5.01">questions you allow them in if not you</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t now for all these individuals that</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="3.78">want all the illegal immigrants coming</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="3.569">in without any type of vetting or</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.59">anything like that leave your front door</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="4.261">open let everyone in what&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="3.419">actually they can house with you but</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="2.039">again once you take it that far people</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="3.45">said</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="6.631">oh just a minute here now during a White</text>
  <text start="189.659" dur="4.83">House press briefing Tom Holm an acting</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.649">director of Immigration and Customs</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="6.181">Enforcement and US Attorney John Huber</text>
  <text start="197.849" dur="5.03">were brought in to discuss two upcoming</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.59">pieces of immigration legislation and</text>
  <text start="202.879" dur="4.78">there were reporters that were out there</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="7.14">and one of the reporters were from CNN</text>
  <text start="207.659" dur="7.711">which was Jim Acosta now director Holman</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="5.13">made the point that out of the 66,000</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="4.11">illegal arrested since Trump&amp;#39;s executive</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="5.549">orders on immigration enforcement were</text>
  <text start="219.48" dur="4.95">signed 73% of everyone we have arrested</text>
  <text start="223.079" dur="4.5">were criminals</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="5.309">Holman also noted that Isis emphasis on</text>
  <text start="227.579" dur="4.921">breaking up gangs and transnational</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="7.65">smuggling organizations was top priority</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="7.53">now Jim Acosta came out and he basically</text>
  <text start="237.389" dur="5.31">was accusing the director of making a</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="4.739">sound as if undocumented immigrants</text>
  <text start="242.699" dur="4.77">commit more crimes than people who are</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.851">just native-born Americans and it looks</text>
  <text start="247.469" dur="6.211">like he got this question out of the</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="5.31">research done by Cato Institute and the</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="4.769">director said I think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="4.619">misinterpreting what I&amp;#39;m saying number</text>
  <text start="258.449" dur="3.63">one people that enter this country</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="4.381">illegally violate the laws of this</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="5.221">country you can&amp;#39;t want to be part of</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="5.16">this great nation and not respect its</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="5.489">laws and that once an illegal alien has</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="4.02">been given due process that final order</text>
  <text start="272.789" dur="4.741">from a federal drug needs to be</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="5.369">something or this whole system has no</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="5.069">integrity and then he went on to say</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="5.821">that did I say aliens commit more crimes</text>
  <text start="282.599" dur="6.151">than US citizens I didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="7.919">and he&amp;#39;s right he did not say that now</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="6.15">if you enter this country illegally you</text>
  <text start="293.219" dur="4.95">should be concerned that someone is</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="5.489">looking for you he said and a constant</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.53">then hit the director with a</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="4.351">hypothetical tear jerker about</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="4.71">separating an illegal immigrant mother</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="4.679">from her dreamer children calling the</text>
  <text start="307.409" dur="5.19">Trump administration adherence to the</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="6.06">law cold and clinical and the director</text>
  <text start="312.599" dur="5.551">responded to this US citizen families</text>
  <text start="315.479" dur="4.801">get separated every day when a parent</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="4.5">gets arrested for a criminal charge</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="4.95">when someone chooses to enter this</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="4.26">country illegally and they&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="325.23" dur="4.32">illegally and they choose to have a</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="6.72">child that&amp;#39;s a US citizen they put</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="6.18">themselves in that position if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="4.289">have border security if we don&amp;#39;t enforce</text>
  <text start="335.73" dur="4.65">the laws that are written in the books</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="5.311">then you&amp;#39;re never going to control the</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="5.13">border why do you think we&amp;#39;ve got 11 to</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="6.08">12 million illegal people in this</text>
  <text start="345.51" dur="6.69">country now I mean he just shot him down</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.35">incredibly because he just hit the</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="5.9">points and he&amp;#39;s just laying it out that</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="5.759">yes this is why we are doing this and</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="5.86">actually shot down each one of his</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="6.061">answers and I say it again if all these</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="4.41">individuals would like to have these</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="4.38">illegals coming to the country they</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.19">should raise their hands and let them</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="4.89">live in their homes</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="5.5">put them up let them live there until</text>
  <text start="375.75" dur="4.08">they get on their feet and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="3.81">tell you right now most of the people</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="3.87">are going to say absolutely not because</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="4.609">you know why one they don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="5.93">they are - they know they&amp;#39;re criminals</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="6.041">three they&amp;#39;re not going to do it and</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s funny once you put that to them</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="6.57">everyone basically just says okay I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="6.269">out now Paris they are going to be</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="5.85">building their own wall which is very</text>
  <text start="401.789" dur="5.071">interesting but this wall is going to be</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="5.7">around the Eiffel Tower</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="7.08">so unlike the border wall that Trump</text>
  <text start="410.64" dur="7.23">wants to build we see that the French</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re building this shield around the</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="6.299">Eiffel Tower to protect it against</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="6.209">terrorist attacks and they approved a 20</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="5.671">million bulletproof glass wall just over</text>
  <text start="427.169" dur="5.281">eight feet high that will surround the</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="6.72">tower I mean they&amp;#39;re really taking this</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="6.18">too far because we know that 99.999% of</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="3.54">these events that occurred they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.63" dur="3.9">completely false flags so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.1" dur="5.46">really doing is they are setting up</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="5.699">walls around the people really not</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="4.47">around the monuments because think about</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="3.091">it once they do this they&amp;#39;ll do it to</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="3.09">the Louvre they&amp;#39;ll do it to the next</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="2.73">structure and before you know it when</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="3.329">you start to look</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="5.79">down in the open space all you see is</text>
  <text start="456.449" dur="5.791">walls all around you and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="5.13">what they&amp;#39;re doing now out in the</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="5.13">Philippines we see do-dirty he is going</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="5.64">after the Islamic state and he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="6.66">his troops that listen do whatever it</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="6.45">takes we&amp;#39;re taking back the Philippines</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="5.19">and they&amp;#39;re going full out in fighting</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.349">them and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="4.199">part of the CIA operation the</text>
  <text start="481.409" dur="4.771">intelligence agencies using their paid</text>
  <text start="483.419" dur="5.011">mercenary forces to basically have</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="3.51">regime change in the Philippines this is</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="4.049">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they use these</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="4.71">paid mercenaries all over the place to</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="4.62">push terror in each one of these</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="6.66">countries to basically have the</text>
  <text start="497.099" dur="6.451">government fold and basically take over</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="4.889">the country and have regime change now</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="5.13">we see this is coming from the Iraq</text>
  <text start="505.949" dur="4.62">military a brigadier general saying that</text>
  <text start="508.68" dur="6.18">the Islamic state self-proclaimed</text>
  <text start="510.569" dur="8.431">Caliphate is no more there Isis revenue</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="6.78">is down 80% and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="519" dur="5.7">group&amp;#39;s apparent collapses backed up by</text>
  <text start="521.64" dur="5.49">a study released Thursday morning that</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="4.44">found three years after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="2.73">state declared its Caliphate on parts of</text>
  <text start="529.14" dur="3.54">Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="6.15">well it&amp;#39;s lost all almost all of its</text>
  <text start="532.68" dur="6.659">revenue it&amp;#39;s lost roughly 2/3 of its</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="6.48">territory and they are on the run now</text>
  <text start="539.339" dur="6.721">Putin he was giving a televised speech</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="5.7">in Moscow on Wednesday and without</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="4.74">specifying which nation he was referring</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="5.399">to he&amp;#39;s saying that there are operations</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="5.58">to influence the domestic political and</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="4.951">social process in our country the</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="4.62">Kremlin is convinced the United States</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="6.09">is laying the groundwork for regime</text>
  <text start="561" dur="6.18">change in Russia and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="564.63" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s accusing foreign spy agencies of</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="5.13">supporting terrorism terrorism to</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="4.799">destabilize Russia just like they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="5.399">been doing in other countries and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="5.31">absolutely right this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="577.709" dur="5.911">they want but they wanted to do all</text>
  <text start="580.019" dur="5.671">along their plan was to go into China</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.55">have regime change to go into Russia</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="4.76">have regime change actually</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="4.08">deep state was empire-building across</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="3.87">the world this is what they wanted to do</text>
  <text start="592.25" dur="4.23">but we can see that it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="5.34">apart right now because we can see out</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="5.549">in Iraq and on the border of Syria well</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="4.95">the u.s. is giving up its position at</text>
  <text start="602.029" dur="5.401">the Syrian Iraq border the crossing near</text>
  <text start="604.61" dur="5.099">Tampa now remember their plan was to</text>
  <text start="607.43" dur="4.83">move from Al tamp north towards the</text>
  <text start="609.709" dur="4.411">Euphrates River and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="612.26" dur="6.66">capture and control the whole south east</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="7.14">of Syria but Syria its allies they made</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="5.52">an unexpected move and they completely</text>
  <text start="621.26" dur="5.759">prevented this plan now the US are cut</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="5.009">off from the Euphrates by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="627.019" dur="6.391">west-to-east line that ends at the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="629.449" dur="8.061">border the u.s. they are just sitting in</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="7.47">the basically mid piece of the desert</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="6.579">around Al tamp where their only position</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="5.579">is to die of boredom or to move back to</text>
  <text start="644.089" dur="4.651">Jordan where they came from now the US</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="5.19">military as we know they moved in the</text>
  <text start="648.74" dur="5.52">high Mars missile launcher with 300</text>
  <text start="651.649" dur="5.611">kilometers reach from nearby Jordan to</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="7.43">Al tamp now they thought by doing this</text>
  <text start="657.26" dur="9.78">this was going to scare the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="661.69" dur="7.509">scare the allies scare these forces but</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="4.169">the stun didn&amp;#39;t work it made no</text>
  <text start="669.199" dur="4.651">difference because it didn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="671.209" dur="5.971">it was still in Jordan or if it was put</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="5.16">up into this area we can see that they</text>
  <text start="677.18" dur="4.649">didn&amp;#39;t care they didn&amp;#39;t care that the</text>
  <text start="679.01" dur="7.05">weapon was there and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="681.829" dur="8.07">right now is they&amp;#39;ve lost their position</text>
  <text start="686.06" dur="9.209">at the border crossing and their entire</text>
  <text start="689.899" dur="7.081">plan just completely fell apart now US</text>
  <text start="695.269" dur="3.63">Special Forces they&amp;#39;ve been deployed</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="4.02">into the Kurdish held northern Syria</text>
  <text start="698.899" dur="5.011">area along the border between Syria and</text>
  <text start="701" dur="5.399">Turkey in recent days the deployment</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="5.239">well it wasn&amp;#39;t announced by the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="706.399" dur="5.761">but it was revealed by the Kurdish YPG</text>
  <text start="709.149" dur="6.461">now the Pentagon still hasn&amp;#39;t directly</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="6.869">commented on the matter and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="715.61" dur="5.339">convinced that within the Pentagon and</text>
  <text start="719.029" dur="2.971">of course within the main structure of</text>
  <text start="720.949" dur="3.511">the government there are row</text>
  <text start="722" dur="4.74">elements that are doing things without</text>
  <text start="724.46" dur="3.87">the other parts of government or the</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="3.39">Pentagon knowing what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="728.33" dur="4.62">and this is why we see all this</text>
  <text start="730.13" dur="5.22">happening because both sides the deep</text>
  <text start="732.95" dur="3.99">state side the Trump administration side</text>
  <text start="735.35" dur="3.93">where he has as individuals that are</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="5.55">working against a deep state they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="739.28" dur="5.49">trust each other and again Trump he</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="4.22">doesn&amp;#39;t know who to trust he has certain</text>
  <text start="744.77" dur="4.59">individuals and we also know that</text>
  <text start="746.71" dur="4.45">there&amp;#39;s spying equipment within the</text>
  <text start="749.36" dur="3.48">White House and we know that it will</text>
  <text start="751.16" dur="4.53">leak anything that is in there and this</text>
  <text start="752.84" dur="5.79">is why a lot of it is basically kept</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="4.17">very very quiet so no one really</text>
  <text start="758.63" dur="3.92">understands what&amp;#39;s going on and this is</text>
  <text start="759.86" dur="6.48">why I think that announcement about this</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="8.08">Syrian chemical attack well this was a</text>
  <text start="766.34" dur="6.39">warning to Syria Russia Iran letting</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="3.78">them know that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="772.73" dur="4.53">Islamic state they were planning on</text>
  <text start="774.41" dur="7.65">something now does this mean the plan is</text>
  <text start="777.26" dur="6.9">dead no and I think right now what is</text>
  <text start="782.06" dur="3.99">happening is they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="4.59">for some type of event what kind of</text>
  <text start="786.05" dur="5.13">event will it happen in Syria we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="788.75" dur="5.04">know will it happen in Europe don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="791.18" dur="5.04">but we know something is about that</text>
  <text start="793.79" dur="5.49">happening happen because the silence is</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="6.78">deafening we do know that Trump and</text>
  <text start="799.28" dur="8.79">Putin will meet at the next g20 summit</text>
  <text start="803" dur="7.14">in Hamburg and basically Trump is going</text>
  <text start="808.07" dur="4.47">to meet Putin for the first time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="810.14" dur="5.28">going to speak with each other the deep</text>
  <text start="812.54" dur="5.49">state does not want this to happen</text>
  <text start="815.42" dur="4.8">they will stop this any way they</text>
  <text start="818.03" dur="7.22">possibly can and this is why I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="820.22" dur="9.09">we might see some type of an event occur</text>
  <text start="825.25" dur="7.36">maybe tonight maybe tomorrow maybe next</text>
  <text start="829.31" dur="6.39">week to stop this meeting because once</text>
  <text start="832.61" dur="5.04">they meet and they start talking to each</text>
  <text start="835.7" dur="6.33">other which I think they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="837.65" dur="7.2">but out in public and Trump makes an</text>
  <text start="842.03" dur="4.08">announcement that we&amp;#39;re repairing the</text>
  <text start="844.85" dur="3.63">relations with Russia</text>
  <text start="846.11" dur="5.25">well the deep state is in big big</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="6">trouble right now so to stop this</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="4.11">meeting they might try to push some type</text>
  <text start="854.48" dur="3.75">of an event</text>
  <text start="855.47" dur="4.65">and we can see right now Trump has</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="4.38">already called them out on this false</text>
  <text start="860.12" dur="4.65">flag event because again people are out</text>
  <text start="862.61" dur="5.01">there saying that oh they&amp;#39;re announcing</text>
  <text start="864.77" dur="6.15">this false flag and they were planning</text>
  <text start="867.62" dur="5.58">it why would you announce a false flag</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="2.52">event why would you even put that out</text>
  <text start="873.2" dur="3.72">there</text>
  <text start="873.44" dur="4.83">if Trump was going to do something when</text>
  <text start="876.92" dur="4.23">the White House was planning this</text>
  <text start="878.27" dur="5.76">chemical attack why would you announce</text>
  <text start="881.15" dur="6">it where Russia heard it Iran heard it</text>
  <text start="884.03" dur="5.52">Syria heard it I mean think about this</text>
  <text start="887.15" dur="6.87">for a second it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="889.55" dur="6.21">whatsoever - and it&amp;#39;s like using the</text>
  <text start="894.02" dur="5.16">chemical weapons on your own people</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="6">again it makes no sense now we know that</text>
  <text start="899.18" dur="4.17">Russia has satellites above they</text>
  <text start="901.76" dur="2.64">understand they&amp;#39;re looking at the whole</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="3.87">entire situation</text>
  <text start="904.4" dur="4.94">the US has satellites above they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="907.22" dur="5.66">looking at the whole entire situation</text>
  <text start="909.34" dur="7.9">the one thing they really can&amp;#39;t see is a</text>
  <text start="912.88" dur="6.75">fake chemical attack because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="917.24" dur="4.65">not happening they&amp;#39;re making it up and</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="3.61">the only way to get that message out</text>
  <text start="921.89" dur="3.78">there because there are a lot of spies</text>
  <text start="923.24" dur="4.43">there&amp;#39;s a lot of leaks within the White</text>
  <text start="925.67" dur="5.49">House was to make this announcement</text>
  <text start="927.67" dur="5.8">because in every other false flag they</text>
  <text start="931.16" dur="4.08">never came out and said this they never</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="3.06">said this is what we&amp;#39;re about to do and</text>
  <text start="935.24" dur="3.18">if the Islamic state and the deep state</text>
  <text start="936.53" dur="4.32">was going to do something they would</text>
  <text start="938.42" dur="4.56">just do it and then everyone would point</text>
  <text start="940.85" dur="3.63">to it look oh my god look look what</text>
  <text start="942.98" dur="3.51">Assad did this is what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="944.48" dur="4.65">the past you don&amp;#39;t announce something</text>
  <text start="946.49" dur="6.15">ahead of time and say oh this is a false</text>
  <text start="949.13" dur="6.42">flag it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense so what</text>
  <text start="952.64" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that that was</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="5.67">a warning to Russia Iran and Syria that</text>
  <text start="959.33" dur="4.86">the deep state they were planning on</text>
  <text start="961.22" dur="5.64">using this to most likely bring more</text>
  <text start="964.19" dur="5.64">paid mercenaries into this area trying</text>
  <text start="966.86" dur="5.19">to get the public all riled up and it</text>
  <text start="969.83" dur="2.88">was stopped now was it stopped in its</text>
  <text start="972.05" dur="3.75">tracks</text>
  <text start="972.71" dur="5.19">most likely not I think they might still</text>
  <text start="975.8" dur="4.8">try this but we can see with this</text>
  <text start="977.9" dur="4.29">meeting coming up there&amp;#39;s a very good</text>
  <text start="980.6" dur="4.38">chance right now indicators are pointing</text>
  <text start="982.19" dur="6.12">to some type of an event that might</text>
  <text start="984.98" dur="5.73">occur during this next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="988.31" dur="5.13">here and this is what we are looking at</text>
  <text start="990.71" dur="4.65">now hopefully nothing happens and they</text>
  <text start="993.44" dur="2.64">are able to meet and we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="995.36" dur="2.58">worry about it</text>
  <text start="996.08" dur="3.48">but I don&amp;#39;t think the deep State just</text>
  <text start="997.94" dur="3.99">going to sit back and let this all</text>
  <text start="999.56" dur="5.51">happen because they&amp;#39;ve been pushing this</text>
  <text start="1001.93" dur="6.45">Russian propaganda for so long and for</text>
  <text start="1005.07" dur="5.59">for them to meet and to be publicized</text>
  <text start="1008.38" dur="3.72">and for the White House to come out</text>
  <text start="1010.66" dur="4.049">saying that we&amp;#39;re repairing relations</text>
  <text start="1012.1" dur="5.91">with Russia this is not going to work</text>
  <text start="1014.709" dur="5.25">out well for the deep state so this is</text>
  <text start="1018.01" dur="3.63">what we&amp;#39;re watching here listen everyone</text>
