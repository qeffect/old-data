  <text start="97.979" dur="3.931">interview and you can play it right on</text>
  <text start="99.33" dur="4.85">the site let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="101.91" dur="4.739">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="104.18" dur="4.21">now over the many years we talked a lot</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="4.171">about the Affordable Care Act which is</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="6.44">also known as Obamacare and we can see</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="7.35">at this point that Trump&amp;#39;s push to</text>
  <text start="114.83" dur="5.98">repeal Obamacare well it didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="4.62">Obamacare well it&amp;#39;s imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="4.169">we can see a lot of the coops they are</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.35">completely closing the insurance is</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="4.561">completely unaffordable people just</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="5.46">cannot pay the premiums the deductibles</text>
  <text start="129.54" dur="5.88">are very very high now it seems that</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s a new bill that is out there put</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="5.52">out by Bernie Sanders and this bill is</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="4.619">to create a universal Medicare program</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="6">and this is going to be like a</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="5.611">single-payer proposal which is going to</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="4.68">be introduced to Congress now I believe</text>
  <text start="149.07" dur="5.34">this was their plan all along to get</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="6.869">everyone dependent on the government and</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="7.1">to use this universal type of program to</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="5.341">get everyone on board and it looks like</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="4.509">Obama care might have been the stepping</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="5.55">stone to get everyone to this position</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="6.361">and the bill starts by sweetening the</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="5.1">pot for seniors who may be wary about</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="4.5">welcoming the rest of the country into</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="3.63">their warm pool it eliminates co-pays</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="3.81">and deductions</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="4.62">except for name-brand drugs when</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="4.799">generics are available and adds dental</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.54">vision hearing aid coverage to Medicare</text>
  <text start="185.489" dur="3.911">where it didn&amp;#39;t exist before</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="5.01">and we could see right now at the same</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="4.2">time people aged 0 to 18 would be</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="4.11">eligible at the coverage in the first</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="5.25">year in year two of the eligibility age</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="4.95">would be lowered to 45 the next year it</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="5.91">would drop again to 35 and here for the</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="5.01">age restriction would be eliminated and</text>
  <text start="204.76" dur="3.69">we can see they are trying to push this</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="5.4">right now and we&amp;#39;ll have to see where</text>
  <text start="208.45" dur="5.4">this goes we see that the Senate Intel</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="4.59">panel well it looks like they slipped a</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="6.3">sentence into the bill that risks spying</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.61">on US citizens now last month the Senate</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="4.5">Intelligence Committee branded WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.16">a non-state hostile intelligence service</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="4.98">in a throwaway sentence in the annual</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="5.01">intelligence spending bill the sentence</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t officially prescribe any actions</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="4.47">related to this but it was put in there</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="3.99">on purpose and there are growing</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="4.65">concerns about the clause legal</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="5.79">ramifications particularly given its</text>
  <text start="241.24" dur="6.27">lack of specificity on what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="6.54">proposing and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="5.19">that CIA Chief Mike Pompeo he was out</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="3.75">there trying to go after WikiLeaks we</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="4.08">know Jeff Sessions was trying to go</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="5.28">after WikiLeaks and we can see that any</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="4.59">crack down on WikiLeaks by the US</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.2">government would likely Center on trying</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="4.86">to censor media outlets covering the</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="6.33">leaks and I think this was their main</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="6.99">point now North Korea they are being</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="4.77">sanctioned Russia China they are bank</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="5.64">they are backing these sanctions right</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="6.03">now and the US could impose economic</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="4.98">sanctions on China now we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="6.48">before but Steve minuchin is out there</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="7.11">saying that you know we might basically</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="6.29">cut off trade with China now this would</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="6.87">be absolutely ridiculous remember</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="6.88">Washington runs a 350 billion annual</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="6">trade deficit with Beijing China also</text>
  <text start="300.73" dur="5.91">holds one trillion in u.s. debt which</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="5.43">amounts to 28% of US Treasury bills</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="6.27">notes and bonds held by foreign</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="7.11">governments and we see that if this does</text>
  <text start="312.91" dur="5.49">happen this is not going to work out for</text>
  <text start="316.36" dur="3.24">the United States the United States</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="2.76">because we get a lot of the products</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="3.54">from China</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.32">this will be a problem now they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="323.14" dur="5.58">saying that the they might cut off the</text>
  <text start="325.48" dur="6.06">Swift payment system now remember China</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="6.12">and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been working on an</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="5.97">alternative payment system and their</text>
  <text start="334.84" dur="4.77">payment systems they are up and running</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="4.2">so is this really going to hurt</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="5.1">China and Russia at this point I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="4.47">think so and I think the u.s. right now</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="6.87">possibly can to force China into backing</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="5.63">off to force Russia into backing off now</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s very interesting about North Korea</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="6.13">they are now reporting that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="5.07">detected xenon gas from the North Korean</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.6">nuclear site now this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="4.26">South Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear safety and</text>
  <text start="364.54" dur="4.29">security Commission this is a land-based</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="3.84">xenon detector in the northern</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="6.12">northeastern part of the country and</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="7.8">they found traces of xenon 1:33 isotope</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="6">on nine occasions doesn&amp;#39;t mean there is</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="4.08">any type of nuclear test because what</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re saying is they don&amp;#39;t have hard</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="4.17">evidence they&amp;#39;re not detecting enough of</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="3.45">it and of course the United States is</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="3.12">out there saying yes we&amp;#39;ve detected it</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="4.71">too we think it&amp;#39;s happening out there</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="4.34">also now they are trying to do whatever</text>
  <text start="393.01" dur="3.75">they possibly can</text>
  <text start="394.2" dur="5.35">to push their agenda with North Korea</text>
  <text start="396.76" dur="4.34">they&amp;#39;re even going to the extreme where</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="6.67">hacking Bitcoin now remember North Korea</text>
  <text start="405.13" dur="4.83">it has sanctions on it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="5.67">difficult to deal in the dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="6.209">selling drugs opium from their poppy</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="4.97">fields across the Chinese border they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="4.981">getting currency through that type of</text>
  <text start="418.41" dur="4.66">transaction and most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="5.46">using the blockchain they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="423.07" dur="7.29">crypto currencies to avoid or you know</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="6.6">go around the sanctions now according to</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="4.5">fireEye they&amp;#39;re saying that hackers</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="3.99">money to North Korea have stolen</text>
  <text start="434.86" dur="4.47">bitcoins from at least three South</text>
  <text start="437.2" dur="5.67">Korean crypto currency exchanges since</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="5.97">May of 2017 they use spear phishing</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="5.06">emails but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.489">all of this is that they have no proof</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="3.43">they&amp;#39;re just saying this is who we think</text>
  <text start="450.789" dur="3.93">it is</text>
  <text start="451.36" dur="5.789">they have no hard evidence</text>
  <text start="454.719" dur="4.92">the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="457.149" dur="6.63">because they want to point out that</text>
  <text start="459.639" dur="7.92">North Korea is using the blockchain to</text>
  <text start="463.779" dur="6.72">go around the sanctions and to demonize</text>
  <text start="467.559" dur="4.5">the blockchain just like Jamie Dimon was</text>
  <text start="470.499" dur="3.69">out there saying that you know bitcoin</text>
  <text start="472.059" dur="4.08">is a complete fraud they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="474.189" dur="5.49">whatever they possibly can to make it</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="5.4">look like well it&amp;#39;s bad if you use the</text>
  <text start="479.679" dur="4.26">blockchain it&amp;#39;s bad if you use Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="4.44">and they hook this to ransom where they</text>
  <text start="483.939" dur="4.05">hook this to everything and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.979" dur="5.76">seeing right now is that they still have</text>
  <text start="487.989" dur="7.34">no proof of any of this but they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="491.739" dur="7.32">saying we think this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="495.329" dur="5.68">they don&amp;#39;t know for sure and most likely</text>
  <text start="499.059" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re gonna find out that it was</text>
  <text start="501.009" dur="3">someone completely different just like</text>
  <text start="502.629" dur="3.54">with Sony Pictures</text>
  <text start="504.009" dur="5.13">it was a disgruntled worker North Korea</text>
  <text start="506.169" dur="5.941">never hacked Sony Pictures but they</text>
  <text start="509.139" dur="6.2">wanted everyone to believe this now we</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="7.019">see that the North Korean government</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="7.151">through Russia and China they want to</text>
  <text start="519.129" dur="5.221">speak to the United States Russia Deputy</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="5.279">Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="6.2">is saying that the United States they</text>
  <text start="527.769" dur="6.271">don&amp;#39;t want to speak to North Korea and</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="5.769">we could see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="4.89">United States well the Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="536.319" dur="4.77">want to speak to North Korea they want</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="5.849">war with North Korea they want an</text>
  <text start="541.089" dur="6.091">invasion with North Korea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.779" dur="4.951">gonna keep pushing this agenda until the</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="5.339">very end now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="4.529">happen there was a bombshell joint</text>
  <text start="552.519" dur="3.51">report it was issued by two</text>
  <text start="554.259" dur="4.971">international weapons monitoring groups</text>
  <text start="556.029" dur="5.49">and it confirms that the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="5.349">continued to ship record-breaking</text>
  <text start="561.519" dur="5.37">amounts of weaponry into Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="564.579" dur="6.271">and that the Department of Defense is</text>
  <text start="566.889" dur="6.99">scrubbing its own paper trail now we</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="6.15">talked about this many many many months</text>
  <text start="573.879" dur="4.161">ago even years ago where the United</text>
  <text start="577" dur="4.23">States the Kabala</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="5.739">they were shipping weapons to the</text>
  <text start="581.23" dur="4.26">terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria this</text>
  <text start="583.779" dur="3.271">is where they got the Toyota trucks this</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="2.31">is where they got the American weapons</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="3.42">this is</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="5.789">where they got all the equipment they</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="5.27">needed and now we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="4.68">the organized crime and corruption</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="4.99">reporting project and the Balkan</text>
  <text start="598.269" dur="5.401">investigative reporting network produced</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="4.47">conclusive evidence that not only is the</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="3.93">Pentagon currently involved in shipping</text>
  <text start="605.2" dur="4.259">up to 2.2 billion worth of weapons from</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="5.13">a shady network of private dealers to</text>
  <text start="609.459" dur="5.161">allied partners in Syria mostly and they</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="4.53">were selling a lot of a Soviet weaponry</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="6.029">and a lot of American weaponry but is</text>
  <text start="617.26" dur="6.569">actually manipulating the paperwork to</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="6.571">hide everything they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="623.829" dur="6.061">they&amp;#39;re showing the evidence before what</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="5.1">the paper look look like and after what</text>
  <text start="629.89" dur="3.87">the paperwork looked like so this whole</text>
  <text start="632.32" dur="4.65">thing that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="7.44">a very long time all of this information</text>
  <text start="636.97" dur="7.2">the truth bomb is exploding showing the</text>
  <text start="641.2" dur="6.329">real evidence that this was going on</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="6.02">since 2011 moving forward even probably</text>
  <text start="647.529" dur="6.841">before this where they were supplying</text>
  <text start="650.19" dur="6.19">supporting we paid mercenaries and we</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="4.98">can see right now this is a truth bomb</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="4.62">it just exploded but again is anyone</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="3.479">listening do you see it on the corporate</text>
  <text start="661" dur="5">media I mean this should be all over the</text>
  <text start="662.829" dur="5.88">place that they&amp;#39;re changing the</text>
  <text start="666" dur="4.959">documentation of what they did in the</text>
  <text start="668.709" dur="4.741">past but guess what you don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="670.959" dur="5.851">anywhere we see representatives of the</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="5.79">countries of Russia Iran Turkey they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.81" dur="4.11">gonna meet in Astana to talk about what</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="4.02">is happening in Syria we know that</text>
  <text start="680.92" dur="4.859">Russia and Syria they have basically</text>
  <text start="683.26" dur="4.53">liberated about 85% of Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="5.161">going to be there to liberate the rest</text>
  <text start="687.79" dur="5.039">of Syria about a 100 percent and we can</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="3.6">see right now that the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="692.829" dur="3.711">completely finished in Syria there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="4.44">nowhere for them to go at this point</text>
  <text start="696.54" dur="5.47">basically they&amp;#39;re surrounded it looks</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="5.52">like Assad Russia</text>
  <text start="702.01" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve taken back a Syria the United</text>
  <text start="704.5" dur="4.769">States the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.51" dur="5.04">going to have to leave and basically</text>
  <text start="709.269" dur="5.731">they have no excuses to stay at all at</text>
  <text start="711.55" dur="6.45">this point because there&amp;#39;s only 15% left</text>
  <text start="715" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s no reason they can handle the</text>
  <text start="718" dur="3.69">rest of it and at this point I think</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="3.6">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="721.69" dur="5.07">we want the coalition in the United</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="7.53">States to leave Syria once they say that</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="6.54">game over now we understand that the FBI</text>
  <text start="731.38" dur="4.02">was out there and we reported on this</text>
  <text start="733.3" dur="4.59">yesterday and they were telling all the</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="6.96">private corporations to move away from</text>
  <text start="737.89" dur="8.04">kaspersky and go with other US vendors</text>
  <text start="742.36" dur="7.35">and the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="745.93" dur="7.29">Russia has issued a predict protective</text>
  <text start="749.71" dur="7.29">patch against the CIA back door which</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="6.51">was embedded with within all software a</text>
  <text start="757" dur="5.55">lot of the software and Kaspersky right</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="5.55">now well they have been plugging the</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="5.4">holes this is why they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="765.28" dur="4.56">companies using this this is why they</text>
  <text start="767.95" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t want other governments to use this</text>
  <text start="769.84" dur="5.25">because then they can&amp;#39;t spy basically</text>
  <text start="772.75" dur="7.5">Kaspersky right now is able to shut down</text>
  <text start="775.09" dur="7.8">the backdoor operation of the CIA and we</text>
  <text start="780.25" dur="6.03">see that Putin is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.89" dur="6.09">saying listen he is cold on IT companies</text>
  <text start="786.28" dur="4.62">in Russia to use domestically developed</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="3.9">software saying we cannot trust this</text>
  <text start="790.9" dur="5.43">offer from the United States because the</text>
  <text start="792.88" dur="6.09">CIA has their hands in there and right</text>
  <text start="796.33" dur="4.62">now Russia well they only develop about</text>
  <text start="798.97" dur="3.87">30 percent of their software the rest is</text>
  <text start="800.95" dur="3.45">coming from everywhere else and China</text>
  <text start="802.84" dur="3.3">the same thing and what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="4.05">see is they&amp;#39;re going to ramp up</text>
  <text start="806.14" dur="4.41">developing more and more of their own</text>
  <text start="808.45" dur="4.23">software but we could see it right now</text>
  <text start="810.55" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re plugging up they&amp;#39;re finding the</text>
  <text start="812.68" dur="5.25">backdoors and they&amp;#39;re shutting them down</text>
  <text start="814.69" dur="4.29">this is why there was such a big call</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="3.09">from the FBI</text>
  <text start="818.98" dur="4.11">to tell the private companies hey you</text>
  <text start="821.02" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t want to do this so really the</text>
  <text start="823.09" dur="3.87">private companies have using Kaspersky I</text>
  <text start="825.01" dur="3.69">would continue to use it because and</text>
  <text start="826.96" dur="4.65">this is my personal opinion because it</text>
  <text start="828.7" dur="5.49">shuts down the back doors where the CIA</text>
  <text start="831.61" dur="5.13">can spy on you and we know that CIA from</text>
  <text start="834.19" dur="4.26">vault 7 has the ability to get into all</text>
  <text start="836.74" dur="3.99">your systems it&amp;#39;s embedded in your chips</text>
  <text start="838.45" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s better than Microsoft Google Yahoo</text>
  <text start="840.73" dur="5.61">Twitter Facebook you name it they can</text>
  <text start="844.03" dur="6.36">get into it so what we see happening</text>
  <text start="846.34" dur="5.91">right now is that China Russia they are</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="3.3">standing up to the bully which is the</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="3.279">cabal which is the United States and</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re saying enough is enough</text>
  <text start="855.529" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re shutting this down now out in</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="4.519">Russia in Moscow it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="5.161">worth a lot of major bomb threats</text>
  <text start="862.749" dur="4.09">schools were being evacuated shopping</text>
  <text start="865.31" dur="4.439">centers were being evacuated train</text>
  <text start="866.839" dur="5.91">stations were being evacuated and this</text>
  <text start="869.749" dur="6.21">was all done around 9/11 which is very</text>
  <text start="872.749" dur="4.921">interesting to scare Russia and the same</text>
  <text start="875.959" dur="3.451">thing happened here in the White House</text>
  <text start="877.67" dur="6.539">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="879.41" dur="6.27">the scare level to its height and who</text>
  <text start="884.209" dur="4.32">knows maybe they&amp;#39;re sending a message to</text>
  <text start="885.68" dur="6">Putin layoffs or something big is going</text>
  <text start="888.529" dur="5.901">to happen nothing did happen but it was</text>
  <text start="891.68" dur="7.05">a scare tactic which they&amp;#39;d been using</text>
  <text start="894.43" dur="6.279">so where does the cabal stand right now</text>
  <text start="898.73" dur="4.349">well we see a lot of truth bombs being</text>
  <text start="900.709" dur="5.281">exploded right now more and more</text>
  <text start="903.079" dur="5.25">evidence is coming out the Middle East</text>
  <text start="905.99" dur="3.18">is lost which means is the threat to the</text>
  <text start="908.329" dur="3.99">petrodollar</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="4.889">and the economy is rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="912.319" dur="3.481">the central bank of central banks has</text>
  <text start="914.059" dur="4.041">already said listen this is going to be</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="4.92">worse or it&amp;#39;s more dangerous than</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="3.729">2007-2008 and we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="920.72" dur="4.289">is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="921.829" dur="6.57">there is nothing left unless they do</text>
  <text start="925.009" dur="4.711">something big there&amp;#39;s a big event maybe</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="2.971">in North Korea because what else do they</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="3.33">have left they really can&amp;#39;t do an event</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="3.24">in Syria wouldn&amp;#39;t even make sense at</text>
  <text start="933.05" dur="4.079">this point they&amp;#39;re not gonna do anything</text>
  <text start="934.61" dur="4.44">in Ukraine most likely the only place</text>
  <text start="937.129" dur="3.601">that they&amp;#39;re building this up is North</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="4.44">Korea with them coming out with</text>
  <text start="940.73" dur="4.589">propaganda about xenon gas them coming</text>
  <text start="943.49" dur="3.659">out of propaganda that the North Korea</text>
  <text start="945.319" dur="2.82">already has a ballistic missile which is</text>
  <text start="947.149" dur="2.971">completely untrue they have a</text>
  <text start="948.139" dur="3.51">medium-range missile they&amp;#39;re coming out</text>
  <text start="950.12" dur="3.089">with the fact that they created a</text>
  <text start="951.649" dur="3.75">hundred kiloton and now the United</text>
  <text start="953.209" dur="4.411">States is saying no it&amp;#39;s 250 kilotons</text>
  <text start="955.399" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re just making up numbers to scare</text>
  <text start="957.62" dur="4.5">everyone because they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="4.23">they have to show that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="962.12" dur="3.569">coming after us and they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="964.069" dur="4.531">with the Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="965.689" dur="6.721">without Qaeda this is what they do they</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="6.599">use scare tactics to scare us into</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="5.7">saying yes we need to do this but once</text>
  <text start="975.199" dur="4.8">again we&amp;#39;re catching on we know what</text>
  <text start="978.11" dur="4.889">they&amp;#39;re doing we know what they&amp;#39;re up to</text>
  <text start="979.999" dur="5.851">and guess what we&amp;#39;re not going to let it</text>
  <text start="982.999" dur="6.33">happen so at this point we can see the</text>
  <text start="985.85" dur="5.969">economy&amp;#39;s coming down the Cabal they</text>
  <text start="989.329" dur="3.99">are in a huge amount of trouble the</text>
  <text start="991.819" dur="3.33">courtroom media which is the mouthpiece</text>
  <text start="993.319" dur="2.401">for the Cabal they&amp;#39;re running into</text>
  <text start="995.149" dur="2.34">trouble</text>
  <text start="995.72" dur="3.57">and we&amp;#39;re gonna start we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="997.489" dur="4.861">to see everything start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="999.29" dur="5.009">slowly but surely as we move forward now</text>
  <text start="1002.35" dur="4.949">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the collapse is</text>
  <text start="1004.299" dur="6.15">not coming the economy is in terrible</text>
  <text start="1007.299" dur="5.4">shape the crash will be coming there</text>
  <text start="1010.449" dur="4.2">will be a major reset everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1012.699" dur="4.08">to transition from the west of the East</text>
  <text start="1014.649" dur="4.831">because we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this happen so</text>
  <text start="1016.779" dur="5.131">the way of life here in the United</text>
  <text start="1019.48" dur="5.609">States is going to change dramatically</text>
  <text start="1021.91" dur="5.159">because once we stop being the reserve</text>
  <text start="1025.089" dur="4.2">currency of the world well things are</text>
  <text start="1027.069" dur="5.1">going to change because who has the</text>
  <text start="1029.289" dur="4.02">manufacturing who has the gold it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1032.169" dur="4.14">the United States</text>

  <text start="1047.23" dur="4.919">what they want done and as they get more</text>
  <text start="1049.63" dur="4.139">and more confident as they keep pushing</text>
  <text start="1052.149" dur="3.571">they&amp;#39;re gonna say you know something</text>
