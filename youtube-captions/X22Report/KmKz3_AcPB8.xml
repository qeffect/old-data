  <text start="131.7" dur="7.32">going to see is more vents more failures</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="8.25">and we have to watch very closely at</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="8.87">what the central bank does and we need</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="6.27">to watch what the US government does</text>

  <text start="158.579" dur="5.011">start out in Europe most likely and then</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="6.241">work its way in</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="6.03">they told us that Greece was fixed</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="5.43">everyone is happy there are no problems</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.64">out there but we see there are riots out</text>

  <text start="200.73" dur="5.19">spraying pepper spray and tear gas on</text>
  <text start="202.709" dur="7.14">the people and once again we can see</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="7.319">that Greece is not fixed whatsoever</text>
  <text start="209.849" dur="6.511">all there is is tape on top of tape on</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="6.181">top of tape holding it together Greece</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="4.37">is in a huge amount of debt unemployment</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="6.03">is skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="7.599">nothing has improved whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="5.4">completely impossible to build an</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.74">economy like this yes for the creditors</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="6.24">for the bankers it&amp;#39;s working out very</text>
  <text start="233.069" dur="5.82">well for them we see out in France the</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.489">unemployment rate in France surged in</text>
  <text start="238.889" dur="6.151">August to a 12-month high of 10.5% now</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="5.551">president how long said he will not run</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="8.129">for re-election unless the unemployment</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="8.37">rate is below 10% the question is will</text>
  <text start="253.169" dur="8.19">the lying politicians keep their word</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="6.99">most likely not and he&amp;#39;ll most likely</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="5.161">run no matter where the unemployment</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="6.899">numbers are they love power they never</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="8.7">want to give it up we see ing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="7.891">planning to cut 7,000 jobs we know that</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="6.33">Commerce burn the Commerce Bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="5.63">laying off 9,000 people and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="7.22">to see more financial institutions</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="8.83">laying off more and more individuals</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="6.13">this reminds me of 2008 where</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="4.149">corporations were laying off right</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="7.079">before the stock market crash</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="7.351">and a lot of this is very similar I mean</text>
  <text start="301.979" dur="2.801">Deutsche Bank looks like Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="2.07">right now</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="5.27">maybe not the financials but what is</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="7.079">happening maybe even close to a Lehman</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="5.399">but we can see things are very very</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="5.071">similar</text>
  <text start="315.449" dur="5.59">automakers they reported that US sales</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="4.229">in September and the demand for new cars</text>
  <text start="321.039" dur="4.801">and trucks well they have completely</text>
  <text start="322.689" dur="5.79">sputtered over all US sales were</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="5.129">expected to fall one percent to 1.4</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="4.291">million in September this is the fourth</text>
  <text start="330.969" dur="5.401">month of declining sales this year and</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="7.649">this is coming from JD power and we see</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="7.229">that demand is slowing General Motors</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="6.53">fell one percent former Ford Motor</text>
  <text start="343.599" dur="7.38">Company fell eight percent fiat-chrysler</text>
  <text start="346.949" dur="6.58">fell by one percent and you have to</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="5.22">remember how the sales are calculated in</text>
  <text start="353.529" dur="4.92">the auto industry when the manufacturers</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="7.171">deliver the cars to the dealerships</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="7.53">those are counted as sales and we can</text>
  <text start="363.37" dur="5.46">see right now that this entire economy</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="6.961">has been manipulated to make us believe</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="5.339">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well but every</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="3">time we look at these economic</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="4.771">indicators what do we see we see the</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="5.879">opposite happening we see in the</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.759">restaurant industry this is an a leading</text>

  <text start="409.479" dur="7.951">percent and is now contracting and it is</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="7.41">the worst reading since October of 2012</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="8.19">and when you look we&amp;#39;re back at that</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="7.769">point where it contracted back in 2012</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="4.949">it contracted back in 2010 and right now</text>

  <text start="439.179" dur="10.49">five but right before the crash it was</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="11.22">at 101 so we are below that already and</text>
  <text start="449.669" dur="7.51">the trend right now is down so what</text>
  <text start="455.169" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the situation</text>

  <text start="531.069" dur="5.181">is getting worse we see manufacturing</text>
  <text start="532.66" dur="5.94">growth slowed to a crawl in September</text>
  <text start="536.25" dur="6.31">this suggests that the economy is stuck</text>

  <text start="581.66" dur="6.81">was it really a glitch were they testing</text>
  <text start="583.97" dur="9.44">something and we understand that the</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="9.72">Department of Justice well they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="7.12">these fines on Deutsche Bank and the</text>

  <text start="620.03" dur="4.92">these banks are insolvent yes they put</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="4.86">up the illusion that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="3.63">they passed the stress tests but they</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="5.01">realize that these banks are completely</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="6.75">insolvent one little thing brings them</text>
  <text start="632.09" dur="7.98">down the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="10.2">they understand this now why would they</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="10.08">place a 14 billion dollar fine against</text>
  <text start="645.53" dur="9.03">Deutsche Bank to say you owe us this</text>
  <text start="650.15" dur="9.36">from 2008 global crisis in the year of</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="9.45">2016 8 years later why are they doing</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="6.96">this now was this on purpose because</text>
  <text start="664.01" dur="5.73">they knew exactly what was going to</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="4.5">happen if they did this just like they</text>
  <text start="669.74" dur="4.11">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen if they</text>
  <text start="670.97" dur="4.95">maybe raise the interest rates or if the</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="3.9">ECB raises the interest rates or a Bank</text>
  <text start="675.92" dur="6.59">of Japan raises the interest rates this</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="11.01">is why they haven&amp;#39;t so are they keeping</text>
  <text start="682.51" dur="9.28">Germany in line or have they started the</text>
  <text start="688.76" dur="7.47">collapse of the system they needed</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.64">something to kick it off this way they</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="4.859">can point L</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="6.719">swear now most likely the corporate</text>
  <text start="701.089" dur="4.981">media is not going to push you know push</text>
  <text start="704.149" dur="3.841">this idea out there that the US</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="6.78">government central bankers are starting</text>
  <text start="707.99" dur="6.96">the collapse but we can see right now it</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="5.28">does have the characteristics of an</text>
  <text start="714.95" dur="5.61">economic war we know that Germany is</text>
  <text start="718.13" dur="6.269">moving closer to Russia we know they</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="7.19">want to remove the sanctions that the</text>
  <text start="724.399" dur="8.25">u.s. is trying to enforce against Russia</text>
  <text start="727.75" dur="8.62">so is this being used to control Germany</text>
  <text start="732.649" dur="8.611">and if they don&amp;#39;t listen they will bring</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="6.12">down their economy and then of course as</text>
  <text start="741.26" dur="3.84">we know this is going to spread never</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="5.28">remember the central bankers want this</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="4.859">to implode they might turn around and</text>
  <text start="747.77" dur="4.29">blame this on Germany they want the</text>
  <text start="749.959" dur="5.101">system to implode because the central</text>
  <text start="752.06" dur="6.5">bankers they know they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="755.06" dur="10.14">to use they need legislation passed to</text>
  <text start="758.56" dur="9.07">take further control of the economy they</text>
  <text start="765.2" dur="4.77">will start quantitative easing they will</text>
  <text start="767.63" dur="6.09">lower the interest rates and most likely</text>
  <text start="769.97" dur="8.46">buy equities and we know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="773.72" dur="6.96">to do other things what they are well we</text>
  <text start="778.43" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know right now but we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="780.68" dur="5.7">in the works and they need to show the</text>
  <text start="783.44" dur="5.7">system is coming down so they can bring</text>
  <text start="786.38" dur="4.649">it back up and we know that period of</text>
