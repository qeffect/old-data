  <text start="82.17" dur="5.07">that want to control the crypto market</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="5.341">well they are going to try to do this</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="5.879">with the futures market but it looks</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="5.46">like it&amp;#39;s not going well at all it looks</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="3.571">like they had to shut it down for a</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="3.869">little while because the price</text>
  <text start="96.69" dur="5.61">continually moved up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="99.149" dur="6.42">seeing right now is that the futures</text>
  <text start="102.3" dur="8.099">market that they created which they</text>
  <text start="105.569" dur="7.771">thought was going to control the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="5.601">market it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="7.5">actually happening now</text>
  <text start="116" dur="6.759">Nassim Nicholas Taleb has a warning for</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="4.68">the no brainer traders hoping to use</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="6.03">Bitcoin futures to bet against the</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="7.52">bubble and he said there is no way to</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="6.991">properly short the Bitcoin bubble any</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="7.089">strategy the strategy that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="6.69">entail options is not going to work just</text>
  <text start="140.129" dur="6.271">like we&amp;#39;re seeing right now with the</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="6.739">futures market and also John McAfee is</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="6.57">out there and he&amp;#39;s reinforcing what</text>
  <text start="149.209" dur="7.301">talib is saying that listen you cannot</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="4.769">control the cryptocurrency market in the</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="3.3">same way you&amp;#39;ve been controlling the</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="5.071">gold market the silver market the stock</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.77">market and everything else he said and</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="3.84">this is coming from John McAfee those of</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.5">you in the old school who believe this</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="5.94">is a bubble simply have not understood</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="6.06">the new mathematics of the blockchain or</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="5.25">you did not care enough to try bubbles</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="5.67">are mathematically impossible in this</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="6.03">new paradigm so our Corrections and all</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="5.3">else and what they&amp;#39;re saying right now</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="3.77">is that</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="2.88">whatever the bankers or whatever the</text>
  <text start="187.64" dur="3.45">central bankers are going to try to do</text>
  <text start="188.99" dur="3.96">where they&amp;#39;re gonna try to control what</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="5.52">is happening with bitcoins remember the</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="6.96">cryptocurrency market is going against</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="5.82">the fiat currency system which the</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="5.82">central bank&amp;#39;s control no yes it is a</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="5.94">digital system but everything is created</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="4.89">from their centralized location and then</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="3.3">the banks go ahead and create more but</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s all controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="6.41">bank&amp;#39;s and if you look they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="215.09" dur="5.85">convince you that bitcoin is in a bubble</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="6.22">bitcoin is not going to do well</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="6.15">bitcoin is a fraud terrorists use it and</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.14">the mainstream media is continually</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="3.66">doing the same that bitcoin is going to</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="3.96">collapse any minute and it&amp;#39;s very funny</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="3.81">because when you look at the Fayette</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="4.41">currency regime and you look at</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="3.96">Venezuela Argentina and you look at the</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="3.72">rest of the countries and if you go back</text>
  <text start="238.52" dur="4.62">in history you can see all fire</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="4.98">currencies have collapsed the central</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="6.57">banking system fiat currency has</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="5.4">collapsed collapsed in the past and if</text>
  <text start="249.71" dur="4.23">you really look at this you could see</text>
  <text start="250.91" dur="4.86">you know from history and what has been</text>
  <text start="253.94" dur="5.64">done in the past what would you go with</text>
  <text start="255.77" dur="6.75">a central central bank Fiat system or a</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="5.85">cryptocurrency which is completely</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="6.48">decentralized which is controlled by the</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="7.41">people and it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="269" dur="6.06">manipulate well it looks like the people</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="5.73">and not just the people but other</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="6.63">countries are looking to use the crypto</text>
  <text start="278.57" dur="6.39">market to use it for many different</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="6.42">things like loaning money maybe for oil</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="5.37">and many other things now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="6.24">seeing is we&amp;#39;re seeing a total breakdown</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="7.41">of the entire economic system and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="4.98">happening very very quickly and Bank of</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="2.96">America is out there once again and they</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.23">said that we&amp;#39;ve seen this movie before</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="4.45">it ends with a recession now I do</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="2.97">believe from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="2.97">looking at and all the indicators we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="2.639">been looking at and everything that</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve been going through the recession</text>
  <text start="309.169" dur="3.421">actually started back in 2016 and since</text>
  <text start="311.6" dur="3.66">that time period</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the economy to</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="3.75">make us believe that the economy is</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="3.07">still strong they did this back prior to</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="2.74">2008</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="3.51">actually the recession really started</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="3.99">way before that but again they</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="5.63">manipulated everything now we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="6.99">happening is that the crypto market is</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="5.77">be gaining ground right now and the</text>
  <text start="332.73" dur="4.14">central bank because of what is</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="3.42">happening with the Cabal they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="3.9">a huge amount of trouble trying to</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="5.43">figure out a way to switch us to a new</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="5.64">system and what is happening at the same</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="5.13">exact time is that this people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="3.39">currency is rising up and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="4.35">know what to do</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re stuck here and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="6.24">very worried about this now as the</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.01">economy continually falls apart we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="3.9">gonna get a lot of financial pundits</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="4.08">coming out saying yet you know something</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="3.39">is happening here something doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="3.45">sense and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="4.59">a lot of them come out of the woodwork</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="5.43">and say yeah we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="5.25">when we see this it doesn&amp;#39;t end well</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="4.95">Bank of America&amp;#39;s head of securitization</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="5.55">Chris Flanagan well he&amp;#39;s been looking at</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="5.52">the yield curve and he&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="5.28">spread and looking at the flattening</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="5.46">yield curve and they&amp;#39;re scratching their</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="6.51">heads saying yes something is up right</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="5.4">now unemployment is low and probably</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="2.91">headed lower of course it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="3.84">lower because they&amp;#39;re gonna continually</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="4.8">manipulate the numbers the Fed is intent</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="5.61">on raising rates to stave off future</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="4.2">inflation and he&amp;#39;s saying that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="4.02">seen this before</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="7.11">and typically it ends up with a flat or</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="5.82">inverted yield curve and we think the</text>
  <text start="412.92" dur="4.68">most likely path forward is that the</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="7.05">two-year ten-year spread reaches zero or</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="8.09">inverts sometime over the next year</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="6.39">which will bring us into a recession and</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="5.35">we are seeing all of us now remember</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="5.37">they are looking at this and believing</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="3.96">the data that&amp;#39;s being fed to them we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="4.38">looking at this saying that this is</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.22">manipulated data which means that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="4.44">been in a recession because we know that</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="3.66">the GDP numbers have been manipulated we</text>
  <text start="442.5" dur="3.99">know that the unemployment numbers have</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="4.77">been manipulated we know that Fed has</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="4.95">been manipulating the stock market</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="4.89">manipulating inflation manipulating</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="2.879">everything that we look at and it tells</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="4.709">us one</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="6.421">we are in a recession from everything</text>
  <text start="458.249" dur="5.94">that we looked at this is not a recovery</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="8.12">you don&amp;#39;t have retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="464.189" dur="8.4">down in a growing economy and we already</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="4.809">debunked the online sales propaganda</text>
  <text start="472.589" dur="3.151">that the corporate media is gonna</text>
  <text start="473.669" dur="5.37">continually use to make us believe that</text>
  <text start="475.74" dur="5.459">it&amp;#39;s okay we also know that the housing</text>
  <text start="479.039" dur="4.86">market has been pumped up in 20 cities</text>
  <text start="481.199" dur="4.291">and we know that the banks have been</text>
  <text start="483.899" dur="4.11">keeping houses off the market to make</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="4.5">house prices move up this is not an open</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="3.99">free market we know the stock market has</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="4.759">been controlled by central banks around</text>
  <text start="491.999" dur="5.37">the world they&amp;#39;re buying the Fang stocks</text>
  <text start="494.749" dur="5.681">they&amp;#39;re pumping it up trying to keep it</text>
  <text start="497.369" dur="6.45">above board so everyone believes that</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="7.529">the economy&amp;#39;s still doing well and we</text>
  <text start="503.819" dur="6.541">know that the US Treasury Steve Venetian</text>
  <text start="507.959" dur="5.971">came out and said listen this tax bill</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="6.299">is going to be incredible because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.93" dur="5.029">gonna make it so the economy never goes</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="6">into a recession again which is</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="7.271">absolutely ridiculous if you have a</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="5.401">central bank you&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="3.24">guaranteed you&amp;#39;re gonna end up in a</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="5.18">recession or a depression because this</text>
  <text start="529.47" dur="6.09">is how they rein in their wealth and</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="5.56">what&amp;#39;s very interesting Patrick Watson</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="5.82">over at Malden economics recently made a</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="4.89">brilliant observation and when he was</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="4.68">looking at the tax bill he found that</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="5.19">there is a recession risk hidden inside</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="5.91">of this bill and he said the gap between</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="5.1">the grain line the potential GDP and the</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="4.83">red line actual GDP I&amp;#39;m looking at this</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="8.609">graph of the potential and the actual</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="8.07">GDP represents unused capacity now you</text>
  <text start="562.589" dur="6.631">can see we had a lot of it at the</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="8">recessions 2009 depth the gap slowly</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="6.03">shrank since then now it is closed</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="5.889">sounds great it sounds like this is</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.17">great news but don&amp;#39;t start to celebrate</text>
  <text start="578.759" dur="5.101">just yet</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="7.14">the actual GDP can&amp;#39;t stay above the</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="3.76">potential GDP for long before bad things</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="5.32">start</text>
  <text start="587.62" dur="6.78">to happen and when we look at the output</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="5.78">gap of percent of real GDP verse</text>
  <text start="594.4" dur="8.82">potential GDP when you go back over time</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="10.75">guess what happens when the GDP stays</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="8.82">above the potential GDP well we end in a</text>
  <text start="608.41" dur="7.29">recession a depression and here we are</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="8.4">once again we&amp;#39;re heading towards the</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="7.74">same exact scenario and when we go back</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="7.95">in time we can see this every single</text>
  <text start="623.44" dur="7.44">time so this tax reform could well</text>
  <text start="628.39" dur="5.61">provide for a modest bump to GDP growth</text>
  <text start="630.88" dur="5.07">but that growth bump is being offset by</text>
  <text start="634" dur="3.99">the Federal Reserve tightening its</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="4.11">monetary policy by lifting interest</text>
  <text start="637.99" dur="4.31">rates and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="4.98">really haven&amp;#39;t seen before either and</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="6.4">having both of these happen at the same</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="7.08">exact time well this is going to end up</text>
  <text start="648.7" dur="5.4">in a disaster now we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="652.12" dur="5.04">other indicators that we&amp;#39;ve mentioned</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="5.82">where they have a pretty darn good track</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="4.74">record going back to the 70s and even</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="4.2">further than that where every time</text>
  <text start="661.9" dur="3.809">certain things happen we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="4.38">recession and this just this is just</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="5.731">another one that we add to the list and</text>
  <text start="668.5" dur="4.68">we could see right now that all these</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="4.35">indicators are pointing to the same</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="5.33">exact thing the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.79" dur="5.04">keeping us away from all of this is the</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="3.85">manipulation and you know when you</text>
  <text start="680.83" dur="2.759">manipulate anything you only could do it</text>
  <text start="682.36" dur="3.39">for a certain period of time before</text>
  <text start="683.589" dur="3.571">everything starts to fall apart and you</text>
  <text start="685.75" dur="3.65">could see it like in companies like</text>
  <text start="687.16" dur="5.429">Enron you can see it with different</text>
  <text start="689.4" dur="4.93">Ponzi schemes you can see countries that</text>
  <text start="692.589" dur="3.481">have done this in the past where they</text>
  <text start="694.33" dur="4.05">tried to create a lot of currency to</text>
  <text start="696.07" dur="4.709">keep the system going and it sounds</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="4.38">great it looks great feels great but in</text>
  <text start="700.779" dur="4.891">the end what happens the whole thing</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="7.23">falls apart now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="9.06">something very important the entire Fiat</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="8.19">system was created to make everyone</text>
  <text start="714.73" dur="5.55">believe that this system is the system</text>
  <text start="718.18" dur="3.24">that we should be on now since nineteen</text>
  <text start="720.28" dur="3.63">that might have to go before</text>
  <text start="721.42" dur="5.07">back before 1913 but here in this</text>
  <text start="723.91" dur="5.52">country there were other central banks</text>
  <text start="726.49" dur="5.04">that were removed and Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="729.43" dur="5.1">removed the last central bank but in</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="6.33">1913 we see the central bank came back</text>
  <text start="734.53" dur="5.01">and they were able to you know get into</text>
  <text start="737.86" dur="4.11">the system once again and take control</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="5.19">of the system and everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="741.97" dur="5.22">remember the finance system it creates</text>
  <text start="744.73" dur="5.16">free money in unlimited quantities and</text>
  <text start="747.19" dur="6.27">what it does is it it impoverishes</text>
  <text start="749.89" dur="6.99">everyone who holds the currency now in</text>
  <text start="753.46" dur="6.66">the initial boost phase the issuance of</text>
  <text start="756.88" dur="5.07">nearly free money to borrowers qualified</text>
  <text start="760.12" dur="3.53">or not generates the illusion of</text>
  <text start="761.95" dur="4.11">prosperity that&amp;#39;s why in the beginning</text>
  <text start="763.65" dur="4.96">everyone feels great there&amp;#39;s not a lot</text>
  <text start="766.06" dur="4.68">of debt the currency is being printed</text>
  <text start="768.61" dur="2.85">and everyone thinks wow this is</text>
  <text start="770.74" dur="4.35">incredible</text>
  <text start="771.46" dur="6.24">but once the boost face phase ends</text>
  <text start="775.09" dur="4.98">reality sets in and the marginal borrows</text>
  <text start="777.7" dur="5">borrowers default inflation moves from</text>
  <text start="780.07" dur="6.27">assets good inflation to world world</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="6.57">essentials bad inflation and it creates</text>
  <text start="786.34" dur="7.2">they have to create more free money to</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="5.71">overcome the problems crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="793.54" dur="6.3">on the other hand when we look at these</text>
  <text start="794.98" dur="7.89">same exact situation they are like fiat</text>
  <text start="799.84" dur="6.09">currencies the difference is they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="802.87" dur="6.99">give you the illusion of wealth they</text>
  <text start="805.93" dur="7.59">don&amp;#39;t add interest on the creation of</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="6.12">currency and since you&amp;#39;re not adding</text>
  <text start="813.52" dur="5.85">interest you&amp;#39;re not stealing the wealth</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="6.18">from the people from the people and we</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="6.21">can see that central banks with a finite</text>
  <text start="822.16" dur="5.52">currency they steal the wealth from the</text>
  <text start="825.58" dur="3.96">people and it gets worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="4.05">time goes on and eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="4.56">is the system gets too big too bloated</text>
  <text start="831.73" dur="4.32">too much debt that they need to restart</text>
  <text start="834.1" dur="5.97">it and this is what they&amp;#39;re in process</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="6.21">of doing and this is why the Cabal has</text>
  <text start="840.07" dur="4.95">been out there in the central banks have</text>
  <text start="842.26" dur="4.02">been out there pushing war because they</text>
  <text start="845.02" dur="2.82">need a distraction they need to make</text>
  <text start="846.28" dur="2.7">sure that everyone doesn&amp;#39;t realize what</text>
  <text start="847.84" dur="3.69">is happening and they say oh look</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a war a war happened now we can</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="3.81">restart the system and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="853.9" dur="2.94">everything is</text>
  <text start="855.34" dur="4.26">we started everyone feels good because</text>
  <text start="856.84" dur="5.97">you were in the initial boost phase of</text>
  <text start="859.6" dur="4.62">their current their fiat currency system</text>
  <text start="862.81" dur="3">and then eventually what happens over</text>
  <text start="864.22" dur="5.28">the many years the whole thing falls</text>
  <text start="865.81" dur="6.39">apart once again and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="869.5" dur="5.07">right now is the central banks they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="5">prepared for this move the Cabal was</text>
  <text start="874.57" dur="7.14">preparing for some type of an event and</text>
  <text start="877.2" dur="6.55">everything is now in chaos because of</text>
  <text start="881.71" dur="6.33">crypto currencies it looks like crypto</text>
  <text start="883.75" dur="8.33">currencies it was created on purpose to</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="7.8">put the system into chaos to shift</text>
  <text start="892.08" dur="7.66">everything from the central bank to the</text>
  <text start="895.84" dur="6.57">people and countries they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="899.74" dur="6.03">realize that wait a minute we can start</text>
  <text start="902.41" dur="6.75">by passing the petro dollar we can start</text>
  <text start="905.77" dur="5.91">by passing the sanctions now Venezuela</text>
  <text start="909.16" dur="4.65">didn&amp;#39;t mention this they said listen we</text>
  <text start="911.68" dur="3.24">can start our petrol coin I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="913.81" dur="3.06">calling it a petro coin</text>
  <text start="914.92" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s a crypto currency it is backed by</text>
  <text start="916.87" dur="6.5">oil and we can use this on the</text>
  <text start="920.71" dur="5.61">blockchain and bypass the sanctions</text>
  <text start="923.37" dur="5.85">Russia is thinking about doing this</text>
  <text start="926.32" dur="6.03">Iran is thinking about doing this and</text>
  <text start="929.22" dur="5.68">Syria is thinking about doing this all</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="5.85">the countries that have sanctions</text>
  <text start="934.9" dur="5.58">against them will move away from the</text>
  <text start="938.2" dur="5.7">petro dollar into something completely</text>
  <text start="940.48" dur="5.45">different and cryptocurrencies makes it</text>
  <text start="943.9" dur="5.1">very easy for them to bypass everything</text>
  <text start="945.93" dur="5.5">so right now we can see the Arab League</text>
  <text start="949" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re threatening the petro dollar we</text>
  <text start="951.43" dur="4.77">see Venezuela Russia Iran Syria and many</text>
  <text start="954.28" dur="4.05">other nations most likely North Korea is</text>
  <text start="956.2" dur="4.8">going to jump on board with this where</text>
  <text start="958.33" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re threatening the entire dollar</text>
  <text start="961" dur="6.18">system and what this means is is that</text>
  <text start="964.96" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time and</text>
  <text start="967.18" dur="5.07">everything that we talked about where we</text>
  <text start="970" dur="4.62">said you know everyone will start moving</text>
  <text start="972.25" dur="6.36">away from the dollar the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="974.62" dur="7.74">well it&amp;#39;s happening very very slowly and</text>
  <text start="978.61" dur="5.91">now it&amp;#39;s accelerating because because of</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="3.42">this birth of cryptocurrencies is making</text>
  <text start="984.52" dur="3.6">a lot easier for countries to say you</text>
  <text start="985.78" dur="3.21">know something we have the ability to do</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="3.51">this and</text>
  <text start="988.99" dur="6.659">they&amp;#39;re standing up to the old system</text>
  <text start="991.63" dur="6.12">and the old system right now well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.649" dur="4.141">just it it&amp;#39;s the old system and</text>
  <text start="997.75" dur="4.74">everything is about to change them when</text>
  <text start="999.79" dur="4.169">we go through this change it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1002.49" dur="4.44">a little painful for those people who</text>
  <text start="1003.959" dur="5.041">aren&amp;#39;t prepared I mean think about it if</text>
  <text start="1006.93" dur="3.3">you don&amp;#39;t know that anything is</text>
  <text start="1009" dur="2.88">happening and you&amp;#39;re holding on to</text>
  <text start="1010.23" dur="3.24">dollars and you&amp;#39;re thinking that</text>
  <text start="1011.88" dur="4.11">everything is great you have your job</text>
  <text start="1013.47" dur="6.39">and all of a sudden they tell you that</text>
  <text start="1015.99" dur="5.55">the dollar is devalued it&amp;#39;s not worth</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="3.75">anything and we&amp;#39;re gonna start something</text>
  <text start="1021.54" dur="3.72">new but you can trade that dollar in for</text>
  <text start="1023.61" dur="4.56">pennies on the dollar to get the new</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="6.36">currency well yes you&amp;#39;ll be able to make</text>
  <text start="1028.17" dur="6.029">out and you&amp;#39;ll get something for it but</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="4.829">you will not retain your wealth think</text>
  <text start="1034.199" dur="4.471">about the person that&amp;#39;s prepared who has</text>
  <text start="1036.449" dur="7.471">gold and silver because once the dollar</text>
  <text start="1038.67" dur="8.34">is devalued and the entire system is</text>
  <text start="1043.92" dur="4.61">free of manipulation gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="1047.01" dur="3.36">this is why Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="1048.53" dur="4.99">purchasing a lot of gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1050.37" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to rise to a new level</text>
  <text start="1053.52" dur="3.45">depending on what the currency is going</text>
  <text start="1054.96" dur="3.66">to be if you&amp;#39;re holding cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1056.97" dur="4.56">and the new currency is cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1058.62" dur="5.13">guess what you&amp;#39;ll be able to use that</text>
  <text start="1061.53" dur="4.86">going forward and as we can see that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1063.75" dur="5.19">continually rising and once everyone</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="4.91">gets in and everyone has a phone it</text>
  <text start="1068.94" dur="5.7">makes it very easy to use you can use</text>
  <text start="1071.3" dur="6.43">your gold and silver because that will</text>
  <text start="1074.64" dur="5.82">rise in value to trade it in for the new</text>
  <text start="1077.73" dur="5.97">currency if you have cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1080.46" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ll be right on board for the new</text>
  <text start="1083.7" dur="4.77">system and if it&amp;#39;s a completely</text>
  <text start="1085.92" dur="5.49">different currency you still have gold</text>
  <text start="1088.47" dur="5.22">and silver that retains your wealth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1091.41" dur="6">an insurance policy if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1093.69" dur="5.64">holding dollars guess what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1097.41" dur="4.47">to have a very difficult time and when</text>
  <text start="1099.33" dur="4.92">we go through this period of time where</text>
  <text start="1101.88" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re transitioning where the dollar</text>
  <text start="1104.25" dur="4.23">loses value remember a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1106.23" dur="3.21">country is not realizing what is</text>
  <text start="1108.48" dur="3.63">happening and I&amp;#39;m not just say in the</text>
  <text start="1109.44" dur="4.56">country the world guess what happens</text>
  <text start="1112.11" dur="3.66">credits gonna freeze up for a little</text>
  <text start="1114" dur="3.179">while you&amp;#39;re gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1115.77" dur="3.39">difficult to get products it happened</text>
  <text start="1117.179" dur="3.99">during the Soviet Union it happened in</text>
  <text start="1119.16" dur="3.78">Germany and we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="1121.169" dur="5.101">because as the</text>
  <text start="1122.94" dur="6.75">of the dollar continually decreases the</text>
  <text start="1126.27" dur="5.19">cost of goods goes up because you need</text>
  <text start="1129.69" dur="3.72">more of those dollars to pay for it and</text>
  <text start="1131.46" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re gonna use as much as you possibly</text>
  <text start="1133.41" dur="4.86">can but during this period of time most</text>
  <text start="1135.48" dur="5.22">likely they will stop people from taking</text>
  <text start="1138.27" dur="3.57">funds out of the bank because remember</text>
  <text start="1140.7" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re not going to need a hundred</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="3.96">dollars you&amp;#39;re gonna need thousands of</text>
  <text start="1143.7" dur="5.73">dollars just to pay for an item and</text>
  <text start="1145.8" dur="6.15">you&amp;#39;ll bleed the banks of all whatever</text>
  <text start="1149.43" dur="4.32">cash they have or you&amp;#39;ll be asking for</text>
  <text start="1151.95" dur="3.63">the cash and they just won&amp;#39;t have any to</text>
  <text start="1153.75" dur="3.15">give you so you know that banks are</text>
  <text start="1155.58" dur="4.41">definitely going to close down for a</text>
  <text start="1156.9" dur="5.82">bank holiday at this point and of course</text>
  <text start="1159.99" dur="4.29">without any type of an event this will</text>
  <text start="1162.72" dur="3.83">be a disaster for the central banks</text>
  <text start="1164.28" dur="5.1">because how do you explain this</text>
  <text start="1166.55" dur="4.84">they can&amp;#39;t this is why they need</text>
  <text start="1169.38" dur="3.93">something to distract everyone for what</text>
  <text start="1171.39" dur="3.63">is coming and normally they have some</text>
  <text start="1173.31" dur="1.95">type of war an event or something like</text>
  <text start="1175.02" dur="2.88">that</text>
  <text start="1175.26" dur="5.22">but at this point it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1177.9" dur="4.68">heading to a period where that event</text>
  <text start="1180.48" dur="3.96">might not happen actually it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="1182.58" dur="4.35">good thing for the people we will go</text>
  <text start="1184.44" dur="4.68">through some pain but for those people</text>
  <text start="1186.93" dur="3.63">who are prepared you&amp;#39;ll know how to</text>
  <text start="1189.12" dur="3.27">weather the storm those people who are</text>
  <text start="1190.56" dur="3.84">not prepared it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little bit</text>
  <text start="1192.39" dur="5.88">more difficult and they might lose a lot</text>
  <text start="1194.4" dur="5.97">of their wealth and a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="1198.27" dur="4.11">other countries have lost a lot of their</text>
  <text start="1200.37" dur="4.05">wealth going through a period where they</text>
  <text start="1202.38" dur="3.71">were not prepared I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="1204.42" dur="4.08">go back just to the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="1206.09" dur="3.94">those people that had gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1208.5" dur="4.17">and they just held on to it and said</text>
  <text start="1210.03" dur="3.99">listen I&amp;#39;m keeping it I&amp;#39;m not not giving</text>
  <text start="1212.67" dur="3.9">it up I don&amp;#39;t want the paper currency</text>
  <text start="1214.02" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m gonna keep it it was $20 an ounce</text>
  <text start="1216.57" dur="3.84">and think about it if you if you had a</text>
  <text start="1218.37" dur="6.29">hundred ounces or a thousand ounces and</text>
  <text start="1220.41" dur="7.14">you had a lot of silver it was re valued</text>
  <text start="1224.66" dur="6.1">235 dollars an ounce and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1227.55" dur="5.13">your wealth jumped the same thing is</text>
  <text start="1230.76" dur="4.14">going to happen here and Russia and</text>
  <text start="1232.68" dur="4.73">China they realize this they know that</text>
  <text start="1234.9" dur="5.1">the gold and silver places have been</text>
  <text start="1237.41" dur="4.48">manipulated and kept down and they know</text>
  <text start="1240" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s going to rise and this is why</text>
  <text start="1241.89" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing it at such a</text>
  <text start="1243.12" dur="3.87">cheap price the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="1245.43" dur="4.56">happen those people that got in at</text>
  <text start="1246.99" dur="7.26">Bitcoin - litecoin you name it at a very</text>
  <text start="1249.99" dur="6.569">low price you know $10 $200 $500 $1000</text>
  <text start="1254.25" dur="5.879">in the end they will make out those</text>
  <text start="1256.559" dur="4.95">will that come in later at 20,000 30,000</text>
  <text start="1260.129" dur="3.63">well it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1261.509" dur="6.27">difficult because it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1263.759" dur="5.611">difficult to get that cryptocurrency so</text>
  <text start="1267.779" dur="3.421">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying from the</text>
