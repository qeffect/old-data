  <text start="58.9" dur="5.88">1478 a and todays it is January 22nd</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="5.34">2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.78" dur="4.74">everything has put into place a slow the</text>
  <text start="67.28" dur="4.59">collapse to prepare for the transition</text>
  <text start="69.52" dur="4.87">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.87" dur="5.25">financial news now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="4.98">shutdown of the government has ended and</text>
  <text start="77.12" dur="4.38">we knew it was going to end they were</text>
  <text start="79.37" dur="4.14">gonna keep the government shutdown they</text>
  <text start="81.5" dur="4.35">were going to borrow more money they</text>
  <text start="83.51" dur="4.23">were going to continue on with</text>
  <text start="85.85" dur="4.89">everything and this is how it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="87.74" dur="5.46">throughout the past they&amp;#39;ve never kept</text>
  <text start="90.74" dur="4.98">the government shutdown for a long</text>
  <text start="93.2" dur="5.91">period of time they always come together</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="6.18">because they don&amp;#39;t want the money to</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="5.13">stop flowing into their pockets and</text>
  <text start="101.9" dur="4.38">everyone thinks well they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="3.66">for the benefit of the people but they</text>
  <text start="106.28" dur="4.5">really aren&amp;#39;t now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="107.9" dur="4.74">interesting about all of this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="3.839">gonna explain why Trump is taking</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="3.3">responsibility for the economy even</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="2.641">though the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="115.94" dur="3.39">the economists saying yes it is his</text>
  <text start="117.26" dur="3.899">economy why he&amp;#39;s pointing to the stock</text>
  <text start="119.33" dur="3.84">market and saying look how great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.159" dur="5.371">doing look how great I made the economy</text>
  <text start="123.17" dur="6.09">because he is using their methods on</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="5.76">them think about what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="129.26" dur="5.22">the past where they pushed the market up</text>
  <text start="132.29" dur="5.25">to all-time highs then they brought it</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="5.07">down he&amp;#39;s doing the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="3.51">he&amp;#39;s gonna do the old switcheroo later</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="4.68">on and I&amp;#39;ll be discussing that but what</text>
  <text start="141.05" dur="5.07">I want to talk about here is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.23" dur="4.229">doing right now and it&amp;#39;s not just him</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not just Trump it&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="6.241">Patriots behind him working with him</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="7.559">trying to get rid of those individuals</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="7.38">that were trying to basically bring down</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="6.301">the u.s. to a level that we would not be</text>
  <text start="162.08" dur="5.79">able to survive and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="6.57">right now is they need time they need</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="5.01">time and they need to maneuver to bring</text>
  <text start="171.08" dur="4.469">it down in the way they want to bring it</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.43">down now the central banks they want the</text>
  <text start="175.549" dur="5.401">system to come down in their manner and</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="5.28">that usually has to do with some type of</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="4.95">an event or if there was a new party</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="3.31">coming in Republicans Democrat they</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="2.71">complained on the old</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="3.96">party but this time it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="3.93">different because when Trump came in he</text>
  <text start="190.86" dur="4.34">wasn&amp;#39;t really part of the Republican he</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="5.699">wasn&amp;#39;t really part of the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.95">they were shocked that he actually won</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="6.181">and the economy at that point in time</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.729">well it wasn&amp;#39;t ready and if everything</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="4.349">wasn&amp;#39;t in place for them to do this</text>
  <text start="206.879" dur="4.681">and it would be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="4.05">disaster and they&amp;#39;ve been holding off</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="2.519">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the central banks</text>
  <text start="212.819" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve been holding off holding off</text>
  <text start="214.079" dur="5.52">hoping that Trump would take</text>
  <text start="217.439" dur="4.321">responsibility for the economy they</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="4.14">would pump it up and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="3.449">pumping it up has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="2.851">Trump it&amp;#39;s actually the manipulation</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="1.62">that the central banks are doing right</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="2.489">now</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;re pumping it up to a point</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="4.951">where they can blame it on him and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="4.231">gonna see articles come out of the</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="6.09">corporate media saying that you know the</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="6.629">economy might be turning downward we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="3.839">seeing signs of it and all this stuff</text>
  <text start="242.189" dur="3.33">but we know the economy&amp;#39;s doing terribly</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="3.09">right now and the only thing that</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="3.511">everyone is looking at is the stock</text>
  <text start="247.049" dur="5.19">market now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="6.569">that Trump came out with his new tax</text>
  <text start="252.239" dur="6.36">bill and you know everyone&amp;#39;s applauding</text>
  <text start="255.599" dur="5.161">and everything like that and yes funds</text>
  <text start="258.599" dur="4.261">will come back from corporations that</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.29">have been pushed overseas and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="6.63">coming back to United States the tax</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="7.53">bill will still add five hundred billion</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="6.54">to one trillion to the deficit over the</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="5.579">coming decade in fact those estimates</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="4.29">are probably understate the final cost</text>
  <text start="278.159" dur="5.521">since Congress is likely to extend</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="6.3">provisions to set to sunset in order to</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="5.25">meet Senate budget rules if the</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="5.039">President and Congress come up with an</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.709">infrastructure bill even more red ink</text>
  <text start="291.659" dur="4.141">will flow now the committee for</text>
  <text start="293.639" dur="4.171">responsible federal budget predicts</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="4.83">deficits of about one point zero five</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="4.039">trillion and 1.1 trillion in 2019 and</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="3.779">2020</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="5.141">now the thing that&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="304.409" dur="7.741">that his he&amp;#39;s slowing down</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="9.03">everything where they have time to</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="5.65">prepare us for a transition into the new</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.369">system</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="7.109">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the IMF</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="5.49">the central banks they&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="324.909" dur="4.831">growth looks a lot better right now</text>
  <text start="326.879" dur="4.871">they&amp;#39;re saying growth will continue on</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="4.049">and I&amp;#39;ll explain that in a little bit</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="3.72">but I wanted to talk about these strange</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="3.451">anomalies that are in the market and</text>
  <text start="335.47" dur="4.8">this is how you can tell that things are</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="4.889">really manipulated over the past week</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve highlighted several market</text>
  <text start="342.129" dur="5.581">indicators which and many others have</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="6.629">found surprising concerning about you</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="5.82">for Chris Crowley in the new year and we</text>
  <text start="351.219" dur="5.67">can see that it has reached all-time</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="6.479">record highs without a five percent</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="6.421">correction and very low pairwise</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="5.91">correlations within equity indices now</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="5.31">we can add one more of these strange</text>
  <text start="365.919" dur="7.291">things that are happening because we are</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="7.5">seeing a odd krod at cross asset price</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="6.84">action according to the cross asset</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="6.69">strategist Jeremy Hale he writes that</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="5.58">the sp500 has rallied to new highs</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="6.329">credit spreads have widened slightly</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="5.789">over the tights and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="5.37">right now is something that is very very</text>
  <text start="391.419" dur="6.06">strange we also see that the US equity</text>
  <text start="394.509" dur="5.431">market has never done this before which</text>
  <text start="397.479" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re gonna mention in a second the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="399.94" dur="5.729">500 is trading at a price to sales ratio</text>
  <text start="402.909" dur="6.63">of two point three five times which is a</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="6.411">new record for high valuation the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="6.06">500 is up eight of the last nine weeks</text>
  <text start="412.08" dur="6.91">16 of the last 19 weeks and 15 of the</text>
  <text start="415.599" dur="7.591">last 15 months and 22 of the last 23</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="7.019">months this has pushed the sp500 to an</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="7.89">RSI of 88 point for a new record high</text>
  <text start="426.009" dur="10.4">for overbought stocks now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="11.22">seeing here is that the S&amp;amp;P 500 has had</text>
  <text start="436.409" dur="7.841">395 days without a 5% setback this is</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="4.32">the longest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen this before</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="5.339">the last time we&amp;#39;ve seen numbers like</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="4.62">this was back in the 60s around 1965</text>
  <text start="449.589" dur="6.931">which was about not 300</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="9">eighty-six days back in 96 97 that was</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="6.179">394 days and both of these led into a</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="5.28">recession the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="462.699" dur="6.361">right now all of this is looking very</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="7.2">odd and strange and we know that all the</text>
  <text start="469.06" dur="7.05">entire stock market has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="472.72" dur="5.91">by the central bank now the IMF came out</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="4.619">and it raised its global GDP outlook to</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="4.08">the highest in seven years and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.729" dur="4.021">saying thanks to Trump&amp;#39;s tax cuts and</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="4.38">the IMF raised its forecast world</text>
  <text start="484.75" dur="6.96">expansion to about 3.9 percent in 2018</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="7.56">and 2019 up by 0.2 percent and of course</text>
  <text start="491.71" dur="4.829">the UK they&amp;#39;re looking at that country</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="3.18">saying yeah they&amp;#39;re not gonna do as well</text>
  <text start="496.539" dur="3.331">because they&amp;#39;re trying to leave the</text>
  <text start="497.83" dur="5.64">central bank system now we need to</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="5.85">understand what the IMF is saying the</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="4.62">IMF is saying that risk to global growth</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="5.58">forecasts appear broadly balanced in the</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="5.73">near-term but remain skewed to the</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="5.369">downside over the median turn the</text>
  <text start="513.82" dur="6.269">current cyclical up swings provides an</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="5.61">ideal opportunity for reforms shared</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="4.381">priorities across all economies include</text>
  <text start="522.279" dur="4.231">implementing structural reform to boost</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="5.04">potential output and making growth more</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="5.43">inclusive however the improve growth</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="4.59">momentum means that fiscal policy should</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="4.47">increasingly be designed with an eye on</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="4.47">medium-term goals ensuring fiscal</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="5.46">sustainability and bolstering potential</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="4.98">output multilateral cooperation remains</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="4.38">vital for securing the global recovery</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="5.7">and we need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="4.41">happening here the central banks and</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;ve said this many times before</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="6.66">central banks don&amp;#39;t want to crash</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="7.68">systems they want the balance they want</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="6.9">to put countries into debt and maintain</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="6.75">the balance and they want austerity they</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="6.09">want cuts in certain areas Trump right</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="5.91">now is cutting many different areas</text>
  <text start="570.31" dur="6.089">cutting different programs central banks</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="5.21">like this they see this as oh this is a</text>
  <text start="576.399" dur="5.461">good thing we can keep issuing debt and</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;ll cut more look at Greece look at</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="2.6">Cyprus look at many of the countries</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="3.44">where they</text>
  <text start="584.46" dur="5.37">how to push austerity on the people but</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="4.35">they had a cut certain items and the</text>
  <text start="589.83" dur="3.72">central banks were very happy with this</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="4.71">because it allowed them to take more</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="3.15">debt on this is what is happening right</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="3.66">now</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="6.09">the central bank&amp;#39;s see it as a good</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="6.03">thing Trump and those in government are</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="4.89">setting them up how are they setting</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="5.13">them up well we can see what is</text>
  <text start="607.68" dur="5.82">happening here normally in the past the</text>
  <text start="610.92" dur="5.07">central banks and the Cabal they would</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="5.13">push the markets up they would crash</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="4.83">them place you know we need new laws</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;d have to borrow more money and this</text>
  <text start="620.82" dur="7.38">went on and on and on today what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="5.13">seeing is he&amp;#39;s putting forth this tax</text>
  <text start="628.2" dur="4.44">bill to bring a lot of the current</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="6.53">currency back from overseas back into</text>
  <text start="632.64" dur="7.95">this country to give this country time</text>
  <text start="636.59" dur="7.21">to transition into the new system he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.59" dur="7.5">taking credit for the stock market going</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="7.41">up for the economy because his hopes and</text>
  <text start="648.09" dur="6.69">those behind him are hoping that they</text>
  <text start="651.21" dur="5.31">can take this and blame it on the</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="4.68">central bank when the whole thing comes</text>
  <text start="656.52" dur="5.7">down because he&amp;#39;s gonna say he&amp;#39;s been</text>

  <text start="675.39" dur="6.33">and blame it on the central bank</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="6.06">meanwhile the central bank they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="705.3" dur="6.06">Trump are using this to their advantage</text>
  <text start="708.53" dur="4.81">it&amp;#39;s weird how the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="711.36" dur="3.69">out there and they don&amp;#39;t like to say</text>
  <text start="713.34" dur="3.42">well it&amp;#39;s because of Trump that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="715.05" dur="2.969">the stock market going up the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.76" dur="2.939">doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="718.019" dur="4.98">because of Trump they kind of stay away</text>
  <text start="719.699" dur="7.29">from all of that because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="722.999" dur="5.911">to get involved in the positive part of</text>
  <text start="726.989" dur="4.89">what Trump is doing here now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="5.25">really positive he&amp;#39;s using everything</text>
  <text start="731.879" dur="5.76">that they&amp;#39;ve used in the past and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="734.16" dur="6.119">using it on them he&amp;#39;s gonna bring up the</text>
  <text start="737.639" dur="4.591">system like he&amp;#39;s doing right now pump it</text>
  <text start="740.279" dur="4.641">up in the meanwhile in the background</text>

  <text start="748.11" dur="5.31">was their economy they run the economy</text>
  <text start="750.66" dur="7.049">and I was helping the economy out and</text>
  <text start="753.42" dur="5.55">they crashed it and then he can say they</text>
  <text start="757.709" dur="3.06">just didn&amp;#39;t crash it here in the United</text>
  <text start="758.97" dur="5.219">States from everything they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="760.769" dur="5.73">the past globally they destroyed the</text>
  <text start="764.189" dur="5.63">entire system this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.499" dur="6.51">transitioning into this new system and</text>
  <text start="769.819" dur="5.291">this is one method that he is using</text>
  <text start="773.009" dur="4.651">right now to do this now Russia and</text>
  <text start="775.11" dur="6.709">China they&amp;#39;re continually accumulating</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="7.589">gold they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda to</text>
  <text start="781.819" dur="4.661">take over the system Russia the central</text>
  <text start="785.249" dur="4.02">bank has added about three hundred</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="4.859">thousand ounces 9.3 tons of gold to its</text>

  <text start="791.339" dur="7.53">up to about 223 tons in 2017 and since</text>
  <text start="797.069" dur="4.74">June of 2015 the central bank of russia</text>
  <text start="798.869" dur="4.47">has added around 558 tons of gold and</text>
  <text start="801.809" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this because</text>
  <text start="803.339" dur="6.12">gold is a confidence builder when</text>
  <text start="806.429" dur="5.91">systems come down people look to it and</text>
  <text start="809.459" dur="5.31">say okay you have the gold you have the</text>
  <text start="812.339" dur="4.71">real money we trust you</text>
  <text start="814.769" dur="4.56">this is why during Bretton Woods back</text>
  <text start="817.049" dur="4.111">right after World War two all the gold</text>
  <text start="819.329" dur="3.75">came to United States of course the</text>
  <text start="821.16" dur="4.32">infrastructure in Europe was actually</text>
  <text start="823.079" dur="3.781">absolutely in shambles and there was</text>
  <text start="825.48" dur="4.469">only one place to bring the gold that</text>
  <text start="826.86" dur="6.349">was United States now China and Russia</text>
  <text start="829.949" dur="7.38">have all the gold and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="833.209" dur="5.831">use it as a confidence builder for the</text>
  <text start="837.329" dur="3.961">new system they might not even they</text>
  <text start="839.04" dur="4.32">might not back the currency with gold</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="5.909">you don&amp;#39;t have to because they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="843.36" dur="6.149">to use oil to do this and this might be</text>
  <text start="847.199" dur="4.681">a high level currency the countries</text>
  <text start="849.509" dur="4.411">trade and kryptos might be a lower level</text>
  <text start="851.88" dur="3.99">that every that people use every single</text>
  <text start="853.92" dur="3.9">day and this is the way they might do</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="6.06">this now we also need to understand is</text>
  <text start="857.82" dur="6.3">that in Russia Putin has taken control</text>
  <text start="861.93" dur="4.17">of the central bank he calls the shot is</text>
  <text start="864.12" dur="4.05">still private wasn&amp;#39;t Central Bank but he</text>
  <text start="866.1" dur="5.97">tells the central bank what to do</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="8.07">China well they still have the private</text>
  <text start="872.07" dur="5.64">western central bank in China and we</text>
  <text start="876.24" dur="3.93">still have it here in the United States</text>
  <text start="877.71" dur="5.64">now we know that Trump has Andrew</text>
  <text start="880.17" dur="5.76">Jackson hanging on the wall which is a</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.53">signal that he&amp;#39;s going to be going after</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="4.89">the central bank system the private</text>
  <text start="887.88" dur="5.76">western central bank system to get rid</text>
  <text start="890.82" dur="6.51">of it and what we can see which might</text>
  <text start="893.64" dur="6.33">happen later on where Russia the United</text>
  <text start="897.33" dur="4.68">States and China they turn on the</text>
  <text start="899.97" dur="4.14">private western central bank and they</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="4.23">get rid of it once and for all</text>
  <text start="904.11" dur="3.72">and this might happen because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.24" dur="4.23">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="907.83" dur="4.89">that Putin has control of his central</text>
  <text start="910.47" dur="5.67">bank Andrew Jackson is hanging on the</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="5.43">wall behind Trump in his office he also</text>
  <text start="916.14" dur="4.2">has gold curtains the hundred dollar</text>
  <text start="918.15" dur="4.02">bill was redesigned one side is a</text>
  <text start="920.34" dur="4.95">Federal Reserve not note the other side</text>
  <text start="922.17" dur="4.77">is gold and it doesn&amp;#39;t say Federal</text>
  <text start="925.29" dur="4.95">Reserve note it says the United States</text>
  <text start="926.94" dur="5.97">so we can see that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="930.24" dur="4.5">the ultimate plan as we move forward we</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="5.82">know China is setting up the one belt</text>
  <text start="934.74" dur="6.87">one road system Russia is on board many</text>
  <text start="938.73" dur="4.89">of the countries in Asia are on board we</text>
  <text start="941.61" dur="4.77">understand that Europe is going to be on</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="4.32">board we see that Europe is moving</text>
  <text start="946.38" dur="5.22">closer and closer to Russia right now</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="6.05">moving away from the Cabal where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="951.6" dur="5.07">been using Russia as you know the</text>
  <text start="953.99" dur="4.57">boogeyman and we see right now the</text>
  <text start="956.67" dur="3.72">United States will eventually have to</text>
  <text start="958.56" dur="4.44">join this and the only way for this</text>
  <text start="960.39" dur="4.5">entire system to work properly is to get</text>
  <text start="963" dur="3.42">rid of the central bank because</text>
  <text start="964.89" dur="3.78">eventually if you have the central bank</text>
  <text start="966.42" dur="5.01">they will do the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="968.67" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve done over the many years now we</text>
  <text start="971.43" dur="3.48">can see already that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="973.17" dur="5.55">has already started to push their</text>
  <text start="974.91" dur="6.24">propaganda about the economy not doing</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="4.35">too well and we see one of the articles</text>
  <text start="981.15" dur="4.65">that are coming out and this is coming</text>
  <text start="983.07" dur="5.1">from San Francisco CBS local</text>
  <text start="985.8" dur="5.76">where it says economic planning five</text>
  <text start="988.17" dur="5.46">ways to prepare for a downturn now which</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="3.63">is very interesting because the IMF just</text>
  <text start="993.63" dur="2.7">came out and said how great everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.19" dur="2.82">gonna be everything&amp;#39;s when we grown of</text>
  <text start="996.33" dur="4.14">course their estimates are always wrong</text>
  <text start="998.01" dur="5.85">they always revise their numbers later</text>
  <text start="1000.47" dur="5.429">on to say oh sorry about that it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="1003.86" dur="5.789">much lower usually it&amp;#39;s in half of what</text>
  <text start="1005.899" dur="6.75">they told us and we see already that</text>
  <text start="1009.649" dur="4.741">with the stock market going up with the</text>
  <text start="1012.649" dur="3.841">corporate media in the past saying how</text>
  <text start="1014.39" dur="4.77">great the economy was because it was the</text>
  <text start="1016.49" dur="5.07">Obama economy now they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="1019.16" dur="3.989">put out these different articles telling</text>
  <text start="1021.56" dur="3.779">you different ways to prepare for a</text>
  <text start="1023.149" dur="3.361">downturn and this is saying that you</text>
  <text start="1025.339" dur="3.541">know there&amp;#39;s five different ways one</text>
  <text start="1026.51" dur="4.38">take money even if you don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="1028.88" dur="4.98">take a loan take whatever you need keep</text>
  <text start="1030.89" dur="5.039">money and make sure you have it and we</text>
  <text start="1033.86" dur="4.17">also see there&amp;#39;s other information about</text>
  <text start="1035.929" dur="4.38">if you own a business what you need to</text>
  <text start="1038.03" dur="4.5">do if there&amp;#39;s a downturn and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1040.309" dur="4.441">see a lot more of these articles come</text>
  <text start="1042.53" dur="5.37">out because what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1044.75" dur="5.58">is we have the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047.9" dur="4.8">ready to push their agenda we have the</text>
  <text start="1050.33" dur="5.07">Trump the Patriots behind Trump getting</text>
  <text start="1052.7" dur="6.66">ready to push their agenda and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1055.4" dur="6.96">going to be a race to see who controls</text>
  <text start="1059.36" dur="6.3">the narrative of the story in the end</text>
  <text start="1062.36" dur="4.59">but one thing is true is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.66" dur="3.33">going to be going through a transition</text>
  <text start="1066.95" dur="3.6">remember central bank&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1068.99" dur="3.39">how the transition works they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1070.55" dur="3">if it&amp;#39;s hard soft they don&amp;#39;t care if it</text>
  <text start="1072.38" dur="3.179">hurts people they don&amp;#39;t care if they</text>
  <text start="1073.55" dur="5.82">bankrupt people and I think the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1075.559" dur="6.151">with Trump they&amp;#39;re looking to kind of</text>
  <text start="1079.37" dur="3.84">soften the landing a little bit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1081.71" dur="4.05">still gonna be a little difficult it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1083.21" dur="4.41">gonna still be hard because we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1085.76" dur="4.98">moving into a completely new system</text>
  <text start="1087.62" dur="4.62">compared to 1971 where we came off the</text>
  <text start="1090.74" dur="3.3">gold standard when we were still the</text>
  <text start="1092.24" dur="4.11">reserve currency of the world and we</text>
  <text start="1094.04" dur="3.6">moved into the petrodollar system and we</text>
  <text start="1096.35" dur="2.52">were still the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="1097.64" dur="4.14">world we&amp;#39;re just moving on to a</text>
  <text start="1098.87" dur="5.01">different system but we were still the</text>
  <text start="1101.78" dur="5.37">reserve currency and you can see during</text>
  <text start="1103.88" dur="5.91">that transition period people lost jobs</text>
  <text start="1107.15" dur="4.86">in the beginning people couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="4.55">fuel people couldn&amp;#39;t get certain</text>
  <text start="1112.01" dur="6.33">supplies during that period of time and</text>
  <text start="1114.34" dur="7.15">interest rates were very high and</text>
  <text start="1118.34" dur="5.04">all of a sudden back then in the 80s</text>
  <text start="1121.49" dur="3.9">things started to even out and things</text>
  <text start="1123.38" dur="5.149">got better and as time went on things</text>
  <text start="1125.39" dur="7.2">went a little bit better better and now</text>
  <text start="1128.529" dur="6.491">starting in the mid 90s late 90s in the</text>
  <text start="1132.59" dur="6.03">2000s things started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="1135.02" dur="5.31">rapidly because the system had reached a</text>
  <text start="1138.62" dur="3.75">point where it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="1140.33" dur="4.11">anymore and it continually declines</text>
  <text start="1142.37" dur="4.14">declines declines now we&amp;#39;re coming up to</text>
  <text start="1144.44" dur="4.14">a certain period of time where we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="1146.51" dur="3.63">the back end I mean think about it we</text>
  <text start="1148.58" dur="4.11">were coming off the gold standard moving</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="5.279">into a petrol dollar reserve currency</text>
  <text start="1152.69" dur="4.589">and we couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel we couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>

  <text start="1157.279" dur="6.87">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs at this time and now</text>
  <text start="1160.85" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re going off of this petrol dollar</text>
