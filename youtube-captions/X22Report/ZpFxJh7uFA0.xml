  <text start="349.259" dur="10.201">2010 now we know the central bank at</text>
  <text start="354.379" dur="7.54">this point they don&amp;#39;t know which</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="4.199">direction to go in there talking about</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="3.391">negative interest rates they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="363.659" dur="3.361">about raising the interest rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="3.539">doing whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="3.6">the market propped up for a little while</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="3.66">longer because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.049">blamed for this they want to blame</text>
  <text start="372.509" dur="5.94">another group another entity another</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="9.93">country and we&amp;#39;re hearing rumblings</text>
  <text start="378.449" dur="7.681">about taking these funds from the</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="4.951">central bank which they create out of</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="8.46">thin air and supplying them to the</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.66">people called helicopter money and what</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="5.22">they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="6">stimulate the economy they want people</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="7.829">to take this money and spend it in</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="7.5">retail now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="4.411">second we know there are other countries</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="5.75">that have done this the why more</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="6.149">republic well they did this they</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="4.9">continually printed they gave it to the</text>
  <text start="418.199" dur="3.93">people they wanted them to spend it in</text>
  <text start="420.36" dur="5.76">the market and what happened the value</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="6.741">of their currency went down and we saw</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="2.75">hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="429.67" dur="11.91">now the big question about this is who</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="10.86">decides who gets the money who is going</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="6.18">to get it well you know most likely the</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="7.91">everyday person is not going to receive</text>
  <text start="447.76" dur="7.71">much of any just like we saw with</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="5.62">quantitative easing and everything else</text>
  <text start="455.47" dur="6.09">the bank&amp;#39;s never went ahead and loan</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="5.43">them people these funds they put it back</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.95">into the stock market to pump up the</text>
  <text start="464.14" dur="4.74">stock market most Americans don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="4.65">realize this but the primary reason why</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="4.02">stocks are doing better in the u.s. than</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="4.56">in the rest of the world is because of</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="5.57">also stock buybacks where they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="5.91">this free money to corporations and</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re buying back their stocks banks</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="3.66">are receiving this free money and</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re instructed to put it into the</text>
  <text start="485.29" dur="6">stock market to pump it up and according</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="5.01">to wolf Richter corporation spent more</text>
  <text start="491.29" dur="4.35">than a half a trillion dollars buying</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="5.19">back their own stocks over the past 12</text>
  <text start="495.64" dur="5.72">months now when corporations buy back</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="5.04">their stocks that means they are slowly</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="4">liquidating themselves instead of</text>
  <text start="503.89" dur="3.42">pouring money into new good ideas</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re just returning money to the</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="5.88">investors corporate executives they love</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="4.26">stock buybacks because it increases the</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="4.11">value of their stock and big investors</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="4.729">love them too because they love to see</text>
  <text start="517.3" dur="7.5">the value of their stock holdings rise</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="7.961">but in the long run what is this do well</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="6.2">it doesn&amp;#39;t help the situation it puts</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.34">money into those people&amp;#39;s pockets and</text>
  <text start="531" dur="4.36">the rest of the people are being laid</text>
  <text start="533.53" dur="3.33">off because they need the funds to buy</text>
  <text start="535.36" dur="5.79">back the stocks and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="536.86" dur="6.09">layoffs in corporations right now so we</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="5.67">have two things happening at this point</text>
  <text start="542.95" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re keeping the market up there</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="5.61">thinking about printing a lot more</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="3.75">currency who are they&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="4.34">it to we don&amp;#39;t know at this point but</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s going to devalue the currency and</text>
  <text start="556.77" dur="6.19">we&amp;#39;re going to see hyperinflation emran</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="4.17">the rest of the world sees this</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to say who wait a minute</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="4.91">we better start getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="566.56" dur="4.95">reserves the dollar in our reserves and</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="3.97">maybe we should take on a different</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="4.62">currency and they&amp;#39;ll be dumping the</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="4.62">dollars those will also flow back to the</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="6.59">United States which will then devalue</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="9.09">the dollar and we&amp;#39;ll see hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="6.1">so when we look at this situation the</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="3.63">situation is just going to get worse</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="4.13">it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better the</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.87">economic indicators are completely</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="7.3">falling apart the central bank is</text>
  <text start="596.91" dur="7.21">propping up the system until they get</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="5.54">the blame on someone else but things all</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="4.17">around them are starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="7.66">Moody&amp;#39;s has just put Deutsche Bank on</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="9.3">review for downgrade citing execution</text>

  <text start="635.74" dur="6.39">think was around april-may of 2008</text>
  <text start="639.09" dur="5.68">everything started to fall apart well</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="8.64">we&amp;#39;re at the same point with Deutsche</text>

  <text start="650.77" dur="9.53">months after that until the entire</text>
  <text start="653.28" dur="11.65">system fell apart so at this point</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="8.95">everyone needs to realize that they&amp;#39;re</text>
