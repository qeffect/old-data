  <text start="289.849" dur="5.641">what we are seeing right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.009" dur="6.72">seeing the hype when Trump came into</text>

  <text start="298.729" dur="4.47">and like I said the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="3.839">gonna start playing it up that the</text>
  <text start="303.199" dur="4.56">economy is not going to be doing as well</text>
  <text start="305.449" dur="4.611">as everyone thought it was doing and</text>
  <text start="307.759" dur="5.431">we&amp;#39;re starting to see signs of this</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re gonna start reporting on how bad</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="4.83">the economy is doing and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="318.02" dur="4.049">gonna ramp it up now we see that there</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="3.33">are many things happening right here we</text>
  <text start="322.069" dur="4.171">see there are countries there are</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="4.14">essential banks where they&amp;#39;re demonizing</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="4.2">cryptocurrency we know we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="4.169">into this major transition now there are</text>
  <text start="330.44" dur="5.129">certain central banks certain countries</text>
  <text start="332.389" dur="5.041">that they want to track everything that</text>
  <text start="335.569" dur="3.84">has to do a cryptocurrency they want to</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="4.44">control cryptocurrency then we have</text>
  <text start="339.409" dur="4.26">those countries where there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="3">be maybe some type of regime change or</text>
  <text start="343.669" dur="3.18">something happening in their country</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="5.07">because of the Cabal the deep state</text>
  <text start="346.849" dur="6.5">where they are looking to bypass the</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="6.21">dollar completely now India for example</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="6.22">they are taking all measures to</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="5.19">eliminate crypto currencies the</text>
  <text start="359.569" dur="4.141">government does not consider crypto</text>
  <text start="361.34" dur="4.44">currencies legal tender or coin and will</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="6.54">take all measures to eliminate use of</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="8.039">these crypto assets in financing we see</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="7.229">on the other hand Venezuela they just</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="6.331">created the petro and this is a crypto</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="4.651">currency and the Venezuelan authorities</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="4.889">plan to set the initial price of their</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="5.909">national crypto currency at $60 per one</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="5.85">petrol now according to the media</text>
  <text start="388.039" dur="5.1">outlets some thirty eight point four</text>
  <text start="390.889" dur="4.65">million petros are expected to be sold</text>
  <text start="393.139" dur="5.011">during the preliminary phase of the</text>
  <text start="395.539" dur="4.951">trading session and what this will do it</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="5.819">will allow Venezuela to completely</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="9.359">bypass the dollar and use a completely</text>
  <text start="403.969" dur="7.95">different currency so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="5.22">right now is those countries that are</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="5.101">that have a lot of pressure on them who</text>
  <text start="415.069" dur="4.5">have sanctions they&amp;#39;re getting them or</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="5.04">getting around them by using the crypto</text>
  <text start="419.569" dur="4.921">currencies those countries that have the</text>
  <text start="422.06" dur="4.859">private wasn&amp;#39;t central bank where the</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.07">countries are controlled by these banks</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re just demonizing the crypto</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="4.38">currency or saying they won&amp;#39;t accept the</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="5.039">crypto currency or they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="433.94" dur="4.949">they need every single piece of</text>
  <text start="436.969" dur="5.51">information if you&amp;#39;re going to purchase</text>
  <text start="438.889" dur="6.541">or sell or exchange crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="442.479" dur="6.101">this is all about control this is all</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="5.31">about bypassing the dollar so on one</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="3">hand the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="2.76">they</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="4.44">control what everyone&amp;#39;s doing the other</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="4.379">hand we have countries who don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="3.81">the deep state don&amp;#39;t want the central</text>
  <text start="457.879" dur="3.84">banks to control what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re bypassing it and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="461.719" dur="7.23">this new form of currency to do this and</text>
  <text start="465.469" dur="7.32">what is happening here is that the world</text>
  <text start="468.949" dur="8.011">is in chaos because the central bank</text>
  <text start="472.789" dur="5.28">system the way we have known it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="4.13">talking about the private western</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="6.5">central bank the Rothschild Bank is</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="7.629">under threat right now they know it and</text>
  <text start="484.569" dur="5.681">I do believe because Trump does have</text>
  <text start="488.719" dur="4.621">Andrew Jackson hanging in the wall on</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="7.05">his wall in the White House that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="6.77">going to be making a move to separate</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="6.149">the u.s. from the central banking system</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="6.97">everything goes back to the central</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="5.041">banking system and if you don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="3.329">this and you don&amp;#39;t understand let&amp;#39;s do a</text>
  <text start="508.49" dur="5.52">little bit of research you can see by</text>
  <text start="510.409" dur="5.641">creating currency by having the control</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.319">of creating currency and putting</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="5.13">countries into debt and enslaving the</text>
  <text start="518.329" dur="4.801">people you can control a nation you</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have to make any laws you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="3.24">have to do anything like that because</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="5.82">once they&amp;#39;re in debt they have to do</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="6.93">what you say unless the people rise up</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="4.2">and they get rid of the central bank but</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="3.45">most of the countries who have tried to</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="3.96">do this Greece tried to do this they</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="3.69">elected a leader who they thought was</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="5.4">going to go up against the central bank</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="8.13">it didn&amp;#39;t work out he folded that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="6.36">tsipras and he fell in line and we can</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="4.98">see right now there are very few</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="4.349">individuals that will go up against the</text>
  <text start="553.55" dur="5.729">central bank the central bank is very</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="7.141">powerful and they control the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.279" dur="5.101">currency right now the problem is is</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.37">that we have this new crypto currency</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="6.87">system this new currency system where it</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="5.429">can be used to get around the central</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="5.279">banking system that needs day the Cabal</text>
  <text start="572.899" dur="5.81">and this is what they&amp;#39;re most nervous</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="6.091">about so they&amp;#39;re under threat and</text>
  <text start="578.709" dur="6.291">remember the dollar right now and I know</text>
  <text start="582.62" dur="4.12">they could talk about terrorism</text>
  <text start="585" dur="6.21">and no criminals using cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="8.16">well who uses the dollar the deep state</text>
  <text start="591.21" dur="7.17">the Cabal this is their way of funding</text>
  <text start="594.9" dur="5.88">their operations all over the world this</text>
  <text start="598.38" dur="5.25">is what they use to fund everything so</text>
  <text start="600.78" dur="5.61">if we were going to have a transition</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="4.77">and we were going to reset everything</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="3.72">and when we say reset everything it</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s just the economy when</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="4.5">we reset everything it&amp;#39;s people who are</text>
  <text start="612.21" dur="5.49">in government the central bank system</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="5.84">it&amp;#39;s one gigantic reset how do you do</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="5.82">that how do you get rid of certain</text>
  <text start="620.45" dur="5.86">groups who have been controlling the</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="7.65">world for a very long time well during</text>
  <text start="626.31" dur="8.1">the transition you shut down the system</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="5.82">and then you reset it you shut down the</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="5.82">central banking system you shut down the</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="5.01">dollar you make sure that the deep state</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="5.55">the Cabal they don&amp;#39;t have funding they</text>
  <text start="642" dur="7.47">can&amp;#39;t use it to do anything to put</text>
  <text start="645.78" dur="8.28">pressure on nations once you remove the</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="7.83">funding you have control and the only</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="7.62">way to do this and to take control of</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="8.28">the system is to remove the central bank</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="6">system and allow the country to create</text>
  <text start="665.58" dur="5.16">its own currency because if we go</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="7.26">through a transition and the central</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="6.54">bank still exists nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="5.48">the government will once again become</text>
  <text start="677.28" dur="5.309">corrupt because of the free money</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="3.49">everything will be exactly the same</text>

  <text start="683.91" dur="6.51">fine for a couple of years you know</text>
  <text start="687.2" dur="4.47">whatever it takes 10 15 20 30 years</text>
  <text start="690.42" dur="4.35">everyone thing will be great in the</text>
  <text start="691.67" dur="5.32">meantime the central bankers what</text>
  <text start="694.77" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re placing all of</text>
  <text start="696.99" dur="5.46">their laws into place setting up their</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="4.62">system once again once again if China</text>
  <text start="702.45" dur="4.29">still has the private western central</text>
  <text start="704.61" dur="3.84">bank they&amp;#39;ll be doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="706.74" dur="3.57">thing I mean of course everyone will</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="4.98">realize this is happening everyone will</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="5.04">just feel the growth of the new system</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="5.49">because we don&amp;#39;t have that much debt but</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="6.03">the reset will put us back to</text>
  <text start="718.92" dur="5.609">where we were when we went on to the</text>
  <text start="721.38" dur="6.449">petrodollar in 1971 and that was the</text>
  <text start="724.529" dur="5.851">beginning of the central bank system</text>
  <text start="727.829" dur="6.241">where they were able to create currency</text>
  <text start="730.38" dur="6.09">and continually create currency out of</text>
  <text start="734.07" dur="3.81">thin air without it being backed by</text>
  <text start="736.47" dur="4.71">anything there was no checks or balances</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="5.329">or anything like that and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="741.18" dur="6.06">see the same thing happen once again so</text>
  <text start="743.209" dur="7.24">what the people need to do is we need to</text>
  <text start="747.24" dur="6.349">band together we need to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="750.449" dur="6.39">central bank we need to call out and</text>
  <text start="753.589" dur="6.041">demand the central bank no longer</text>
  <text start="756.839" dur="6.031">controls the economy of the United</text>
  <text start="759.63" dur="7.34">States and the world and this is going</text>
  <text start="762.87" dur="7.26">out to the world and if we can do that</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="6.76">we then will be able to take back our</text>
  <text start="770.13" dur="6.03">system because if the currency is</text>
  <text start="773.73" dur="6.21">created and it&amp;#39;s all accounted for and</text>
  <text start="776.16" dur="6.239">let&amp;#39;s say we use a cryptocurrency guess</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="5.91">what there&amp;#39;s only a certain number of</text>
  <text start="782.399" dur="5.821">coins that are produced there&amp;#39;s a ledger</text>
  <text start="785.85" dur="7.52">so we know where these coins have gone</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="8.489">and we know what has been happening</text>
  <text start="793.37" dur="6.13">today because there&amp;#39;s a central bank</text>
  <text start="796.709" dur="5.401">you can&amp;#39;t audit them you can&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="799.5" dur="4.29">their books you can&amp;#39;t do anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.11" dur="4.62">private that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called a private</text>
  <text start="803.79" dur="5.609">western central bank it&amp;#39;s a private</text>
  <text start="806.73" dur="6.93">corporation they don&amp;#39;t want you looking</text>
  <text start="809.399" dur="7.021">at their stuff so we can see that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="4.859">headed towards this transition what type</text>

  <text start="823.44" dur="3.86">before in other reports one or two ways</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="4.469">it&amp;#39;s going to be a hard transition</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="5.2">controlled by the central bank or a</text>
  <text start="829.589" dur="5.94">softer type of transition controlled by</text>
  <text start="832.5" dur="6.24">Trump and others who are trying to bring</text>
