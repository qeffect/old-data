  <text start="308.64" dur="4.92">this is what everyone is thinking but</text>
  <text start="310.47" dur="5.88">everyone is not thinking this and this</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="4.68">we do have proof of all this during the</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="2.6">elections because they were completely</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="4.13">shocked</text>

  <text start="331.4" dur="3.99">no classified information talked about</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="4.32">now these are not audio transcripts</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="5.58">these are handwritten transcripts that</text>
  <text start="337.97" dur="5.13">he was going to give and again we can</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="3.81">see that different individuals from</text>
  <text start="343.1" dur="5.1">different countries are coming out</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="7.02">defending Trump and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="6.33">something that he is working with many</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="4.59">of these nations they understand what</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.47">his he what he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="6.15">they understand that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="359" dur="6.18">remove the deep state and he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="6.78">with these countries yes it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="6.87">believe but he is now Gowdy trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="369.32" dur="7.53">said something very interesting he said</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="7.08">listen Comey has this memo we need to</text>
  <text start="376.85" dur="5.21">see the memo he says I would like to</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="5.46">talk to director Comey to determine how</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="4.9">contemporaneous his recording of the</text>
  <text start="384.59" dur="5.31">conversation was but also importantly</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="6.36">not just what was said but what did</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="6">director Comey hear how did he take the</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="3.6">news and with all due respect to the New</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="3.81">York Times and all the other</text>
  <text start="396.92" dur="5.96">publications they haven&amp;#39;t seen the memo</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;ve only taking part of the memo and</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="6.46">reported on it and he said something</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.12">else that&amp;#39;s very interesting newspaper</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="6.45">articles are not admissible in any</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="5.54">courtroom in the United States and he</text>
  <text start="415.79" dur="5.52">says we&amp;#39;re a long way from conviction</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="6.51">all we have is headlines in all these</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="6.72">different publications and when we see</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="5.56">the government officials sitting there</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="3.72">during hearings reading from newspapers</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="4.74">they should be doing their own</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="6.2">investigation not reading the deep state</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="6.87">speak because that&amp;#39;s what that really is</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="6.82">now let&amp;#39;s analyze what they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="441.62" dur="5.67">talking about and screaming about former</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="4.53">FBI director Comey&amp;#39;s note of his</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="4.53">conversation with Trump well first of</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="3.57">all it&amp;#39;s not evidence of obstruction of</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="4.65">justice or</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="5.52">and clothes firstly it is a standard</text>
  <text start="456.47" dur="3.33">practice for lawyers and officials to</text>
  <text start="458.39" dur="4.2">make notes of all business related</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="4.23">conversations they undertake and to</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="3.69">distribute them to their colleagues</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="4.65">there is nothing unusual or surprising</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="3.96">about Comey drafting a note of his</text>
  <text start="468.68" dur="4.05">conversation with President would be</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.1">president and circulating it amongst the</text>
  <text start="472.73" dur="4.59">senior staff of the FBI what would in</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="3.87">fact have been extraordinary and</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="5.22">alarming would have been if he had not</text>
  <text start="479.21" dur="6.12">done so the mere fact that Comey made</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="4.38">and circulating a note following a</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="3.6">meeting with the president who had only</text>
  <text start="486.92" dur="4.35">just entered office and who Comey</text>
  <text start="488.93" dur="5.79">would therefore scarcely know is that is</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="7.29">not therefore a sign he was being put</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="8.07">under pressure it is highly likely the</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="6.63">President or someone on his staff made</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="6.33">their own record of the meaning and they</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="5.19">have their own notes and of course we</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t know this for sure we know Trump</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="6.62">came out and said he has a recording of</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="8.07">this is the recording we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="517" dur="5.08">secondly the subject that was discussed</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="4.56">during the conversation was not the</text>
  <text start="522.08" dur="4.5">FBI&amp;#39;s Russia gait counter espionage</text>
  <text start="525.08" dur="4.65">investigation but the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.58" dur="4.35">investigation of general Flynn following</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="3.42">up general Flynn&amp;#39;s telephone</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="5.36">conversation on the 29th of December</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="7.17">2016 with Russian ambassador Kissel ACK</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="5.95">now commis note has not been published</text>
  <text start="540.32" dur="5.85">and the New York Times does not claim to</text>
  <text start="542.24" dur="7.98">have seen it however it was apparently</text>
  <text start="546.17" dur="6.93">read out to one of its reporters who</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="6.21">recorded it saying the following I and</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="5.88">here&amp;#39;s the note I hope you can see your</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="5.4">way clear to letting this go to letting</text>
  <text start="558.98" dur="5.43">Flynn go mr. Trump told mr. Comey</text>
  <text start="561.83" dur="5.01">according to the memo he is a good guy</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="4.47">a hope you can let this go mr. Trump</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="4.47">told mr. call me that mr. Flynn had done</text>
  <text start="568.88" dur="4.2">nothing wrong according to the memo mr.</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="3.81">Comey did not say anything to mr. Trump</text>
  <text start="573.08" dur="4.53">about curtailing the investigation</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="5.1">replying only I agree he is a good guy</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="4.29">the note does not show Trump ordering</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="5.37">call me to drop the investigation or</text>
  <text start="581.9" dur="4.8">even asking him to do it it merely</text>
  <text start="585.59" dur="3.09">expresses the whole</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="5.13">he would do so given Trump&amp;#39;s believed</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="7.14">that Flynn had done nothing wrong and we</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="6.77">have to go back to January of 2017 where</text>
  <text start="595.82" dur="7.62">the New York Post reported that the FBI</text>
  <text start="598.6" dur="6.37">cleared Flynn of any wrongdoings but</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="3.48">that doesn&amp;#39;t matter and we have to</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="5.79">remember someone writing something down</text>
  <text start="606.92" dur="6.24">is absolutely meaning it is not evidence</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="4.11">because on the other side trouble said</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="3.66">no this is exactly what I said and</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="5.19">here&amp;#39;s my transcript and then you have</text>
  <text start="616.82" dur="3.57">he said he said edit there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="2.49">there</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="3.74">there&amp;#39;s nothing but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="4.68">make it bigger than it really is so</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="6.58">Chaffetz has said listen I have a</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="6.81">subpoena we want the memo and we all</text>
  <text start="630.71" dur="5.91">like to see it now the Senate they went</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="6.09">a little bit further with this they are</text>
  <text start="636.62" dur="6.21">doing what Chaffetz wants where he wants</text>

  <text start="706.28" dur="4.35">of the letter now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="707.93" dur="5.31">interesting about all this and I think</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="6.36">Comey might have kind of screwed himself</text>
  <text start="713.24" dur="6.66">over with this one because he came out</text>
  <text start="716.99" dur="7.8">and he said that he writes these notes</text>

  <text start="736.91" dur="6.48">a tough one now it looks like Comey now</text>
  <text start="740.36" dur="5.55">is going to be putting himself into the</text>
  <text start="743.39" dur="5.28">hot seat and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="745.91" dur="6.6">problem it looks like what he just did</text>
  <text start="748.67" dur="6.12">might not work out well for him compared</text>
  <text start="752.51" dur="5.43">to trump but the corporate media is not</text>
  <text start="754.79" dur="5.46">going to show it that way but if he did</text>
  <text start="757.94" dur="5.28">do what he said and he has notes about</text>
  <text start="760.25" dur="5.52">everything well a lot of things are</text>
  <text start="763.22" dur="4.59">going to be put out there and all the</text>
  <text start="765.77" dur="4.35">conversations that he has had with all</text>
  <text start="767.81" dur="3.72">these individuals well that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="770.12" dur="4.23">be a problem now if he can&amp;#39;t produce</text>
  <text start="771.53" dur="5.07">some of these things well then he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="6.15">take notes on everything only the thing</text>
  <text start="776.6" dur="6.15">with Trump which doesn&amp;#39;t make sense so</text>
  <text start="780.5" dur="6.27">right now we can see all of this is</text>
  <text start="782.75" dur="7.68">happening and the deep state they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="786.77" dur="5.76">going to let up at all now we can see</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="3.78">that the deep state they are back in a</text>
  <text start="792.53" dur="2.76">corner they&amp;#39;re very afraid of what Trump</text>
  <text start="794.21" dur="3.08">is going to do this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="5.73">pushing their agenda so hard right now</text>
  <text start="797.29" dur="5.26">Trump with his nominee uh David Norquist</text>
  <text start="801.02" dur="4.68">who&amp;#39;s going to serve as the controller</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="5.91">for the Pentagon well he said something</text>
  <text start="805.7" dur="4.92">very interesting and we know that those</text>
  <text start="808.46" dur="4.86">people in the deep State in the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="810.62" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re not going to like this and the</text>
  <text start="813.32" dur="5.43">Pentagon well they&amp;#39;ve been hiding money</text>
  <text start="816.38" dur="4.46">they&amp;#39;ve been stealing money they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="818.75" dur="4.47">shifting funds to different areas</text>
  <text start="820.84" dur="6.37">trillions and trillions of dollars have</text>
  <text start="823.22" dur="7.59">just gone missing and basically he has</text>
  <text start="827.21" dur="6.75">said David Norquist it is time to audit</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="5.25">the Pentagon now they do not want to</text>
  <text start="833.96" dur="3.51">hear this because that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.06" dur="3.09">going to be going through all the books</text>
  <text start="837.47" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;re going to be looking into</text>
  <text start="839.15" dur="8.7">where all this money has gone and this</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="7.17">is going back in time with Rumsfeld and</text>
  <text start="847.85" dur="4.56">the rest and the missing funds in</text>
  <text start="850.04" dur="3.6">Afghanistan and where did the trillions</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="4.08">of dollars go</text>
  <text start="853.64" dur="4.47">and they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen</text>
  <text start="856.49" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening right</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="7.89">now where they&amp;#39;re very very afraid now</text>
  <text start="862.22" dur="5.4">out in South Korea we can see the floor</text>
  <text start="866" dur="5.28">leader of the Senate Korean ruling</text>
  <text start="867.62" dur="7.62">Democratic Party we win shik he said</text>
  <text start="871.28" dur="5.82">that he&amp;#39;s all for basically boxing up</text>
  <text start="875.24" dur="3.9">the terminal high altitude air defense</text>
  <text start="877.1" dur="4.5">system which is the Fed and sending it</text>
  <text start="879.14" dur="4.53">back to the United States he says we</text>
  <text start="881.6" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t need this and because of what</text>
  <text start="883.67" dur="4.62">Trump has said that we need to pay for</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="4.98">this you know something maybe we should</text>
  <text start="888.29" dur="5.4">just give it back and maybe this was the</text>
  <text start="890.69" dur="5.34">plan that Trump wanted maybe he wanted</text>
  <text start="893.69" dur="5.64">them to give it back to take the</text>
  <text start="896.03" dur="5.64">pressure off of China and Russia and of</text>
  <text start="899.33" dur="6.6">course McMaster stepped in and ruined</text>
  <text start="901.67" dur="7.5">that plan now Putin is out there and</text>
  <text start="905.93" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s saying that the US and those nique</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="4.86">on the deep state they are responsible</text>
  <text start="911.57" dur="4.53">for North Korea developing their nuclear</text>
  <text start="914.03" dur="5.52">weapons because they place sanctions</text>
  <text start="916.1" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;ve threatened North Korea and North</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="5.58">Korea decided to start a nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="923.24" dur="3.6">program for defensive purposes because</text>
  <text start="925.13" dur="3.33">they were very afraid that the deep</text>
  <text start="926.84" dur="3.93">state the neocons of central banks were</text>
  <text start="928.46" dur="4.5">going to invade their country and he is</text>
  <text start="930.77" dur="4.14">out there and he is blaming the United</text>
  <text start="932.96" dur="6.66">States for all of this and this is</text>
  <text start="934.91" dur="7.56">absolutely true now South Korea they</text>
  <text start="939.62" dur="5.67">want an open channel with the north they</text>
  <text start="942.47" dur="5.4">want to reopen the communication lines</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="4.74">and we know that deep state they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="5.76">want this to happen but they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="950.03" dur="5.52">for this and we can see that those</text>
  <text start="953.63" dur="4.65">individuals in the deep state and you</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="5.67">know who they are because they speak</text>
  <text start="958.28" dur="5.58">deep state speak and they speak in</text>
  <text start="961.22" dur="5.16">absolutes one of them is nikki Haley I</text>
  <text start="963.86" dur="4.23">mean she just came out and said it and</text>
  <text start="966.38" dur="3.63">spoke in absolutes that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="968.09" dur="5.46">talking about and she said the following</text>
  <text start="970.01" dur="5.55">she is urging other countries to do more</text>
  <text start="973.55" dur="4.5">to pressure North Korea over its weapons</text>
  <text start="975.56" dur="7.2">program saying you either support North</text>
  <text start="978.05" dur="7.8">Korea or you support us wait a minute</text>
  <text start="982.76" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s an absolute sounds like george w</text>
  <text start="985.85" dur="5.7">bush it&amp;#39;s either you with us</text>
  <text start="987.56" dur="10.5">or you with them she is part of the deep</text>
  <text start="991.55" dur="9.3">state she is speaking in absolutes this</text>
  <text start="998.06" dur="4.65">is how you know when someone is part of</text>
  <text start="1000.85" dur="5.58">it because this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1002.71" dur="5.129">instructed to speak so we can see</text>
  <text start="1006.43" dur="3.99">already that she&amp;#39;s part of the deep</text>
  <text start="1007.839" dur="4.621">state which we kind of knew anyhow now</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="4.919">something very interesting came up</text>
  <text start="1012.46" dur="6.21">remember the ambassador Andre Karl of</text>
  <text start="1015.339" dur="6.69">who was shot in an art gallery and there</text>
  <text start="1018.67" dur="5.76">were many different Russian ambassador&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.029" dur="5.341">Russian government officials that were</text>
  <text start="1024.43" dur="7.95">killed but something very interesting</text>
  <text start="1027.37" dur="7.89">about Andre Karloff because he dealt a</text>
  <text start="1032.38" dur="4.23">lot with the north and south and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1035.26" dur="4.679">talking about North Korea and South</text>
  <text start="1036.61" dur="5.49">Korea he was a vocal advocate for the</text>
  <text start="1039.939" dur="3">Russian influence on the Korean Korean</text>
  <text start="1042.1" dur="2.82">Peninsula</text>
  <text start="1042.939" dur="5.311">he had a very good relationship with</text>
  <text start="1044.92" dur="5.61">King Kim Jong Il and they spent many</text>
  <text start="1048.25" dur="4.11">evenings together and they were very</text>
  <text start="1050.53" dur="7.71">close associates and he was very close</text>
  <text start="1052.36" dur="9.06">with Kim jong-un and basically it looks</text>
  <text start="1058.24" dur="7.56">like they got rid of him because if he</text>
  <text start="1061.42" dur="7.14">was alive today he was he is one of the</text>
  <text start="1065.8" dur="6.42">only individuals that would be able to</text>
  <text start="1068.56" dur="7.29">speak to Kim jong-un and work out some</text>
  <text start="1072.22" dur="5.61">type of peace deal with North Korea so</text>
  <text start="1075.85" dur="4.65">if the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1077.83" dur="6.39">and econ&amp;#39;s wanted a go to war with North</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="6.48">Korea what they would do is remove the</text>
  <text start="1084.22" dur="4.59">individual the person who has</text>
  <text start="1086.98" dur="4.65">demonstrated that he could be the force</text>
  <text start="1088.81" dur="5.94">for peace in the north and south they</text>
  <text start="1091.63" dur="5.79">would need to get rid of him and now the</text>
  <text start="1094.75" dur="4.95">pieces are all starting to come together</text>
  <text start="1097.42" dur="4.95">now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="1099.7" dur="6.09">Washington left al Qaeda off the</text>
  <text start="1102.37" dur="6.09">terrorists list and we can see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1105.79" dur="5.49">reason why they did this why did they</text>
  <text start="1108.46" dur="4.68">decide to leave them off the list and</text>
  <text start="1111.28" dur="4.44">this is coming from the Canadian state</text>
  <text start="1113.14" dur="4.38">news agency the reasons for the</text>
  <text start="1115.72" dur="3.99">reluctance to list the new al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1117.52" dur="3.39">formation may have to do with one of its</text>
  <text start="1119.71" dur="5.55">new members</text>
  <text start="1120.91" dur="6.99">the nor IDI dine zenki brigade a jihadi</text>
  <text start="1125.26" dur="5.07">group from the Aleppo government the</text>
  <text start="1127.9" dur="5.31">zenki brigade was an early and prominent</text>
  <text start="1130.33" dur="6.09">recipient of US aid weapons training for</text>
  <text start="1133.21" dur="5.55">the US to designate HTS now now would</text>
  <text start="1136.42" dur="4.49">mean acknowledging that it&amp;#39;s applied</text>
  <text start="1138.76" dur="4.29">sophisticated weapons including tol</text>
  <text start="1140.91" dur="4">anti-tank missiles to terrorists and</text>
  <text start="1143.05" dur="4.26">draw attention to the fact that the US</text>
  <text start="1144.91" dur="5.49">continues to armed Islamist militants in</text>
  <text start="1147.31" dur="6.12">Syria the reason the US cannot designate</text>
  <text start="1150.4" dur="5.4">al Qaeda in Syria as a terrorist group</text>
  <text start="1153.43" dur="4.14">is because that would make the US</text>
  <text start="1155.8" dur="3.81">legally responsible for having supplied</text>
  <text start="1157.57" dur="4.2">a terrorist group with extremely</text>
  <text start="1159.61" dur="3.84">sophisticated weapons and training the</text>
  <text start="1161.77" dur="3.96">u.s. is arming and training terrorists</text>
  <text start="1163.45" dur="5.46">in Syria but instead of just getting out</text>
  <text start="1165.73" dur="5.79">it is pretending that al Qaeda is not a</text>
  <text start="1168.91" dur="4.41">terrorist organization we see that the</text>
  <text start="1171.52" dur="4.74">US military is deploying a new Marine</text>
  <text start="1173.32" dur="6.57">Corps artillery unit to Syria this is</text>
  <text start="1176.26" dur="5.13">coming from Army Major Josh D Jack&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1179.89" dur="2.91">unit is arriving in the country in order</text>
  <text start="1181.39" dur="4.14">to support the us-backed Syrian</text>
  <text start="1182.8" dur="3.93">democratic forces and again this is</text>
  <text start="1185.53" dur="4.14">another terrorist group that they</text>
  <text start="1186.73" dur="5.16">created and mostly it&amp;#39;s made up of</text>
  <text start="1189.67" dur="4.14">Syrians this time as they want us to</text>
  <text start="1191.89" dur="3.18">believe that&amp;#39;s what it is but we can see</text>
  <text start="1193.81" dur="2.43">that all these terrorist groups are</text>
  <text start="1195.07" dur="3.75">still intertwined</text>
  <text start="1196.24" dur="4.95">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="1198.82" dur="6.39">yesterday we mentioned the crematorium</text>
  <text start="1201.19" dur="5.88">and today the US State Department has</text>
  <text start="1205.21" dur="4.65">officially admitted that the alleged</text>
  <text start="1207.07" dur="4.59">crematorium near Damascus where the</text>
  <text start="1209.86" dur="4.62">Assad government was burning dead bodies</text>
  <text start="1211.66" dur="6.36">of thousands of kill prisoners may not</text>
  <text start="1214.48" dur="5.48">be a crematorium at all answering</text>
  <text start="1218.02" dur="4.8">questions during a press briefing</text>
  <text start="1219.96" dur="6.34">Stewart Jones acting assistant secretary</text>
  <text start="1222.82" dur="6.42">for Near East interferes well he has</text>
  <text start="1226.3" dur="5.34">been pushed to admit that the warmer</text>
  <text start="1229.24" dur="5.25">part of the building could be anything</text>
  <text start="1231.64" dur="5.76">it could be the heating system it could</text>
  <text start="1234.49" dur="6.27">be the kitchen it could just be anything</text>
  <text start="1237.4" dur="5.76">and this is exactly what we said there</text>
  <text start="1240.76" dur="5.07">was no toll smokestacks there was</text>
  <text start="1243.16" dur="5.76">nothing there and again there was no</text>
  <text start="1245.83" dur="5.46">evidence to show anything the deep State</text>
  <text start="1248.92" dur="4.89">is just coming out with information to</text>
  <text start="1251.29" dur="3.38">push their agenda now something very</text>
  <text start="1253.81" dur="4.58">interesting</text>
  <text start="1254.67" dur="6.84">and is really official is calling for</text>
  <text start="1258.39" dur="5.22">the assassination of Assad right now and</text>
  <text start="1261.51" dur="4.26">it looks like they&amp;#39;re getting really</text>
  <text start="1263.61" dur="4.68">desperate because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="1265.77" dur="4.74">right now because we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1268.29" dur="4.68">deep state they are losing control and</text>
  <text start="1270.51" dur="5.04">remember Israel the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1272.97" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re all part of the same system and</text>
  <text start="1275.55" dur="5.1">we can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="1277.62" dur="6.99">breaking down where if they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1280.65" dur="7.14">Assad out now that is it time is up</text>
  <text start="1284.61" dur="5.13">Russia Syria they will have full control</text>
  <text start="1287.79" dur="3.72">of the country the United States there</text>
  <text start="1289.74" dur="3.66">is absolutely no reason for the United</text>
  <text start="1291.51" dur="3.39">States to be in there they have the</text>
  <text start="1293.4" dur="4.59">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1294.9" dur="4.98">have invaded a sovereign country and if</text>
  <text start="1297.99" dur="4.05">the Islamic state is completely removed</text>
  <text start="1299.88" dur="5.34">and the terrorist groups are pushed back</text>
  <text start="1302.04" dur="5.82">there is no reason for any country to be</text>
  <text start="1305.22" dur="5.1">in Syria so the clock is ticking down</text>
  <text start="1307.86" dur="5.28">they realize this and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
