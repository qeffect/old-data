  <text start="58.58" dur="6.06">episode 1661 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.88" dur="5.52">September 11th 2018 and the title the</text>
  <text start="64.64" dur="5.37">episode is it&amp;#39;s all being coordinated at</text>
  <text start="67.4" dur="4.8">the same time to transition the country</text>
  <text start="70.01" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.2" dur="6.33">financial news now we are seeing really</text>
  <text start="75.32" dur="5.46">a perfect storm hit all at once and</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="4.89">everything is tied in coordinated</text>
  <text start="80.78" dur="4.83">together to transition this entire</text>
  <text start="83.42" dur="4.199">country just not economically but</text>
  <text start="85.61" dur="3.9">transition it away from the central bank</text>
  <text start="87.619" dur="3.931">and the deep state and their plans that</text>
  <text start="89.51" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ve had for the last many many many</text>
  <text start="91.55" dur="3.78">many years and we can see it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="4.41">happening at once</text>
  <text start="95.33" dur="5.91">now remember the economy the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.33" dur="3.33">economy is breaking down an accelerated</text>
  <text start="101.24" dur="3.66">rate</text>
  <text start="101.66" dur="5.13">the only thing that the government the</text>
  <text start="104.9" dur="3.45">central banks are looking at are the</text>
  <text start="106.79" dur="3.93">manipulated numbers these numbers have</text>
  <text start="108.35" dur="5.25">been manipulated going back as far as we</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="4.98">can tell and as we got into 2008 they</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="3.54">just manipulated them even more so to</text>
  <text start="115.7" dur="3.66">make it look like the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="117.14" dur="4.019">fantastically we&amp;#39;ve gone through these</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="4.71">numbers we looked at it and we can see</text>
  <text start="121.159" dur="4.711">just like with wholesale trade well that</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="5.4">is declining right now it missed again</text>
  <text start="125.87" dur="3.96">and they do have the ability to pump it</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="2.94">up</text>
  <text start="129.83" dur="4.56">the numbers come back down they pump it</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="3.24">up the numbers come back down they</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="3.48">manipulate it they change the</text>
  <text start="135.65" dur="3.63">calculation they leave things out to</text>
  <text start="137.87" dur="2.94">make it look like everything is</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="4.2">fantastic and when we look at all this</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="6">we can see why because the economy is</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="6.21">really not doing it as well as everyone</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="4.62">thinks it is doing now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="4.89">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="6.75">Trump is now out there saying the</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="5.969">economy is fantastic and he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="4.65">saying this for quite a while Obama came</text>
  <text start="160.549" dur="4.581">out of the woodwork and he is out there</text>
  <text start="162.83" dur="6.06">saying well this was my economy and</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="6.1">you&amp;#39;re riding on my coattails basically</text>
  <text start="168.89" dur="3.83">and the economy that you&amp;#39;re seeing today</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.95">it was because of me</text>
  <text start="172.72" dur="6.13">now this was all done on purpose it was</text>
  <text start="176.18" dur="4.529">to bring Obama out into the spotlight</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="3.719">and if you notice and we&amp;#39;ll go through</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="3.781">this in the next report a lot of these</text>
  <text start="182.569" dur="4.321">individuals have been meaning are being</text>
  <text start="184.49" dur="3.12">brought into the spotlight so people</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="3.6">remember</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="5.13">these individuals so they see them and</text>
  <text start="190.49" dur="5.97">he wants the mainstream media to report</text>
  <text start="192.74" dur="6.75">on them so Trump threw everything that</text>
  <text start="196.46" dur="7.38">he&amp;#39;s been tweeting to counter Obama he</text>
  <text start="199.49" dur="7.44">brought out an economist and this</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="6.51">economist presented all these different</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="6.81">charts and everything to show that this</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="6.99">economy is doing really really really</text>
  <text start="213.74" dur="4.77">well Kevin Hassett came out he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="3.63">chairman of the Council of Economic</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="5.25">Advisers and he fact-checked</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="5.55">Obama&amp;#39;s claim during a Monday press</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.56">briefing and he went on to say yeah look</text>
  <text start="226.52" dur="3.18">everything has changed the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="2.79">doing well now remember they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="229.7" dur="2.94">taking the manipulated numbers and</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re making it look a lot better now</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.96">what this does it shows that the economy</text>
  <text start="237.02" dur="4.969">is doing well that Trump&amp;#39;s plan is</text>
  <text start="239.6" dur="5.25">working and he&amp;#39;s doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="5.411">he knows it&amp;#39;s all manipulated we know</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="5.639">it&amp;#39;s all manipulated but he&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="5.369">so those in power the central bank the</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="4.291">deep state can&amp;#39;t turn around and say he</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="3.301">destroyed the economy think about it</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="4.829">unemployment at three point nine percent</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="5.31">GDP at four point two percent and all of</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="4.471">a sudden you see everyone having a job</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="4.02">and everything looks great how could</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="3.149">they possibly say he destroyed the</text>
  <text start="265.4" dur="7.079">economy it&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty darn hard</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="9.421">at the same time he&amp;#39;s weakening Obama at</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="7.291">every turn call him calling him out into</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="6.69">the spotlight once again and weakening</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="6">him every time he opens his mouth this</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="4.8">is all being done on purpose now</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="5.04">remember it&amp;#39;s just not the economy</text>
  <text start="288.14" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s going to transition it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="5.7">entire country it&amp;#39;s the entire</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="5.37">government it&amp;#39;s the way people think the</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="4.25">mainstream media everything it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="5.52">coordinated as part of the plan</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="4.54">everything has to change and what</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="4.59">cut off the deep state&amp;#39;s funding and</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="5.64">that is through the central bank now we</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="6.87">can see that the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="4.02">are nervous they don&amp;#39;t like what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="3.06">on</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t like the Fed raising rates</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="3.93">and I continually seem</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="5.12">more articles where the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="323.75" dur="7.11">is saying that this is not a good time</text>
  <text start="326.47" dur="7.18">for the central bank the Fed to raise</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="4.92">rates if we look at CNBC they came out</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="5.67">with a headline the Fed thinks it&amp;#39;s safe</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="6.12">to keep hiking rates - it&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.16">market researcher says they are now</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="5.34">countering what the Fed is saying now</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="6.39">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second they</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="5.79">know if the Fed raises rates the entire</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="4.71">system&amp;#39;s going to come down now they</text>
  <text start="353.03" dur="4.83">were raising rates right before Trump</text>
  <text start="355.58" dur="4.5">came into office while Trump was in</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.29">office and to Powell until Powell came</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="3.03">into office and they were doing this</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="3.09">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="3.84">bring down the economy while he was in</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="2.22">office they were gonna give him some</text>
  <text start="366.95" dur="2.7">time</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="3.87">they were going to let him you know push</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="3.18">his tariffs through and things like that</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="2.88">and then they were gonna drop the</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.59">economy and say see it&amp;#39;s his fault</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="5.82">but remember Trump already tweeted out</text>
  <text start="377.42" dur="4.47">he has the magic wand now he can make</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.37">the economy look any way he wants just</text>
  <text start="381.89" dur="6.39">like they did in the past and that was a</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="6.48">message to Obama and the deep state that</text>
  <text start="388.28" dur="6.05">they&amp;#39;re in full control the mainstream</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="5.31">media right now they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re nervous about what is happening</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="3.81">because they lost that narrative they</text>
  <text start="398.81" dur="6.15">lost the narrative where they can say</text>
  <text start="401" dur="6.18">Trump was the cause of the economy</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="5.55">collapsing now we&amp;#39;ve said this in the</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="7.05">past the central bank system that were</text>
  <text start="410.51" dur="5.31">in today only lasts 40 to 45 years maybe</text>
  <text start="414.23" dur="4.17">a little bit longer depending on how you</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="3.96">stretch it out and of course what they</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="2.79">do is they go back in time they say oh</text>
  <text start="419.78" dur="4.29">yeah by the way we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="421.19" dur="6.12">about two years ago we just didn&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="5.16">you know and today people who are out of</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="3.51">work people who are trying to look for</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="3.36">work people are trying to sell their</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="5.1">house they notice that things are</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="6.45">changing quite quickly right now retail</text>
  <text start="435.92" dur="4.86">sales are declining we see GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="2.28">we know this is fake Manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="2.61">declining</text>
  <text start="441.32" dur="4.2">yes Trump is trying to bring all this</text>
  <text start="443.39" dur="5.31">back this is for the transition but if</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="5.07">we look at the CNBC article it goes on</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="4.68">to say the Federal Reserve is widely</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="4.76">expected to hike rates again at its</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="4.4">September meeting in two weeks</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="4.29">another in a string of anticipated</text>

  <text start="459.64" dur="5.91">central bank needs to slow its roll to</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="5.91">avoid breaking the economy says James</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="5.04">Bianco now they&amp;#39;re making the case that</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="5.19">the Fed is moving too quickly with these</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="5.91">rates now this was planned a while ago</text>
  <text start="473.89" dur="5.1">before Powell was in there and they were</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="5.55">planning to continually raise them until</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="5.46">it fell apart but blame it on Trump I do</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="6.93">believe that Powell is now working for</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="6.48">Trump and he&amp;#39;s doing exactly what the</text>
  <text start="488.98" dur="3.93">Fed was planning to do before what the</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="4.11">deep State was plenty to do before raise</text>
  <text start="492.91" dur="4.14">the interest rates to bring down the</text>

  <text start="509.82" dur="8.02">when the Fed raises the rates and</text>
  <text start="514.289" dur="5.681">remember the Fed raises the rates it</text>

  <text start="578.02" dur="2.73">to this if they raise the rates two more</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="2.73">times we&amp;#39;re going to be pretty darn</text>

  <text start="594.49" dur="3.57">I know people gonna write in that well</text>
  <text start="596.23" dur="3.99">in my area they&amp;#39;re still strong yes</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re still gonna be areas where it is</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="6.57">strong we saw this back in 2008 or prior</text>
  <text start="603.82" dur="5.37">to 2008 where the New York metropolitan</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="5.97">area they were seeing traffic pretty</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="5.63">much dry up in Miami during the same</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="4.56">period of time they were still building</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="4.75">speculators were still down there but</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="2.81">six to eight months later what happened</text>
  <text start="619.57" dur="2.82">ooh</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="4.18">everything fell apart and who was hit</text>
  <text start="622.39" dur="4.77">even harder than the New York</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="5.64">metropolitan area the southern Florida</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="4.53">area and we saw this in California where</text>
  <text start="629.95" dur="4.08">people were just leaving their houses so</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="3.6">just because you&amp;#39;re in the United States</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="3.87">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it all happens at the</text>
  <text start="635.29" dur="4.17">same exact time certain areas get hit at</text>
  <text start="637.9" dur="3.15">different times and then it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
