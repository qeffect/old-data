  <text start="53.62" dur="6.06">is episode 1221 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.01" dur="4.89">march six 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="59.68" dur="3.629">episode is the puzzle pieces are coming</text>
  <text start="61.9" dur="4.56">together and the last piece is the</text>
  <text start="63.309" dur="6.241">collapse of the economy let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="66.46" dur="5.94">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="69.55" dur="8.429">as we know the UK is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="72.4" dur="8.43">exit the EU but the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="77.979" dur="5.521">are not going to make it easy for the UK</text>
  <text start="80.83" dur="6.51">to leave because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="83.5" dur="6.06">now is that the EU is saying listen and</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="5.639">we know that Mario Draghi said this</text>
  <text start="89.56" dur="6">before they need to pay up and pay their</text>
  <text start="92.979" dur="5.521">bill and right now what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="95.56" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re saying that the UK owes around</text>
  <text start="98.5" dur="6.03">60 billion euros and they need to pay up</text>
  <text start="102.49" dur="5.37">right now but government lawyers</text>
  <text start="104.53" dur="6.869">concluded there is no law or treaty to</text>
  <text start="107.86" dur="6.42">compel the UK to pay the bill the EU</text>
  <text start="111.399" dur="7.171">officials have estimated at 60 billion</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="6.659">euros and we see at this point the</text>
  <text start="118.57" dur="6.24">central bankers they are doing whatever</text>
  <text start="120.939" dur="5.97">they possibly can to stop the UK from</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="3.36">leaving and I don&amp;#39;t believe this is</text>
  <text start="126.909" dur="3.061">going to be the last thing they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="3.92">to try they&amp;#39;re going to try other things</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="5.28">will probably see a lot more come out as</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="6.07">the time approaches and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="4.29">seeing that they are trying to stop</text>
  <text start="138.16" dur="2.549">those pickles we know that Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="3.419">came out and said listen anyone else</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="3.481">that wants to leave the EU they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="4.861">to have to pay that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="6.12">settle up their account and we can see</text>
  <text start="147.82" dur="4.86">right now that once one country leaves</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="3.75">you know it&amp;#39;s going to be France you</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="2.52">know it&amp;#39;s going to be Italy you know</text>
  <text start="154.06" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s going to be the Netherlands you</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="2.91">know Germany can look at this and say</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="2.85">you know something we better jump ship</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="4.71">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to leave and</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="6.53">that means the EU is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="162.82" dur="6.66">on itself and that will send shockwaves</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="5.83">across Europe and here into the United</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="4.44">States Canada Australia because a lot of</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="5.819">the banking systems are all intertwined</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="5.789">and we will see chaos and it looks like</text>
  <text start="177.849" dur="3.751">we&amp;#39;re heading towards this point I mean</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="7.591">think about what&amp;#39;s happening in March</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="9.3">we have the brexit we have the debt</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="6.06">feeling in the u.s. we have what is</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="5.88">going on with Trump and Obama and</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="5.31">everything else with a deep state and we</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="4.68">can see that going forward that things</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="5.64">are really going to get chaotic I mean</text>
  <text start="201.46" dur="4.83">cliff I said it starting in march</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="3.66">actually david&amp;#39;s document said also is</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="3.57">starting in march things are going to</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="6.21">get chaotic and as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="6.15">this year it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate now a</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="5.52">couple reports ago we talked about a</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="6.36">soda tax in philadelphia and of course</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="4.8">these city officials you know they</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="3.27">implemented a soda tax thinking that oh</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="2.22">this is going to bring in a lot of</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="3">revenue and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="4.26">fantastic and what we saw was that</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="4.7">people had sticker shock and sales</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="4.5">started to drop off and they were</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="4.08">reporting about thirty to fifty percent</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="5.04">drop in beverage sales and then we had</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="5.02">bottlers distributors saying okay listen</text>
  <text start="240.52" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re going to have to start laying off</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="5.82">people now of course there&amp;#39;s no way that</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="5.28">after a month or so or a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="3.84">they know that okay things aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="250.6" dur="2.82">working out because you don&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="3.36">beginning there could be sticker shock</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="3.84">and people get used to it and they start</text>
  <text start="255.46" dur="4.68">paying it and they start ramping up and</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="4.98">buying their soda again but Pepsi right</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="4.56">now is taking advantage of this saying</text>
  <text start="262.24" dur="3.87">yes it is the soda tax and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="264.7" dur="4.65">to be laying off about twenty percent of</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="5.88">our workers in this area now Pepsi</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="4.41">employs about 423 employees in the city</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="4.56">and they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off about</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="5.82">a hundred people right there and we can</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="7.65">see that companies they do make excuses</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="6">of why they are laying off and for some</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="3.39">of the people there they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="4.92">understand why they&amp;#39;re being laid off at</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="4.68">all because types of reports 35 billion</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="4.29">in gross income and six billion in</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="4.26">profit last year and they can&amp;#39;t figure</text>
  <text start="294.79" dur="4.05">out why would they have to lay off</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="3.93">people right now well it looks like</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re gearing up for what is coming</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="4.47">and we saw this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="4.41">eight where companies were laying off</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.4">prior to the market coming down they</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="4.56">already know that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="4.71">deteriorating I mean we look into retail</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="3.06">right now we see the thing retail is a</text>
  <text start="315.04" dur="5.279">complete</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="8.25">disaster februari store sells they have</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="6.931">completely imploded because of declining</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="6.119">store traffic sales have slumped by</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="5.58">seventeen percent from january thirty</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="5.43">first to februari twenty-third compared</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="4.589">to the same period of last year now</text>
  <text start="335.409" dur="4.44">which is kind of odd once again and we</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="6">looked at this before unemployment has</text>
  <text start="339.849" dur="6.151">continually come down how are sales in</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="5.84">stores getting worse they&amp;#39;re not moving</text>
  <text start="346" dur="6.569">to online all these stores have online</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="7.481">presence where they can go and they can</text>
  <text start="352.569" dur="7.771">purchase the goods right online and if</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="6.239">all these stores are suffering and all</text>
  <text start="360.34" dur="7.47">the online sales are not picking up the</text>

  <text start="420.49" dur="4.32">improving it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="422.439" dur="4.65">actually every time we report on this it</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="5.699">is getting worse and worse as time goes</text>
  <text start="427.089" dur="5.911">on the economy is deteriorating as we</text>
  <text start="430.509" dur="4.77">move into the spring and it&amp;#39;s just going</text>
  <text start="433" dur="4.169">to get a lot worse and there are</text>
  <text start="435.279" dur="4.17">individuals out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="4.411">yes we&amp;#39;re going to have problems in the</text>
  <text start="439.449" dur="5.071">second half of this year now if we look</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="4.92">at all the pieces to this puzzle and we</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="4.98">start putting it all together we can see</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="5.13">that GDP completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="5.13">we know that&amp;#39;s in the negative territory</text>
  <text start="451.63" dur="4.8">look at shadow stats he does the</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="4.2">calculation not the manipulated</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="3.72">calculation we know unemployment is much</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="3.81">higher than what they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="5.94">4.8 four-point-seven percent we know</text>
  <text start="462.64" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s around 23 24 25 percent we know a</text>
  <text start="466.09" dur="4.05">lot of people went from a full-time job</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="4.14">to a part-time job we understand that</text>
  <text start="470.14" dur="4.23">housing prices are coming down in many</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="4.2">locations and people are lowering their</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="5.88">prices over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="6.51">because traffic is not there even in the</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="5.25">20 cities that case shiller looks at</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="6.65">we&amp;#39;re having a flat line of housing</text>
  <text start="485.5" dur="3.8">prices and they&amp;#39;re starting to drop</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="6.31">retail is a complete disaster we</text>
  <text start="493.45" dur="5.93">understand from UBS the credit impulses</text>
  <text start="495.64" dur="6.15">below zero credit is going to freeze up</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="5.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing that core factory orders</text>
  <text start="501.79" dur="6.12">they have dropped and they&amp;#39;re only at</text>
  <text start="504.82" dur="5.7">point three percent now right after the</text>
  <text start="507.91" dur="5.4">elections they shot up to 2.5 percent</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="5.97">and we&amp;#39;re back to where we were that</text>
  <text start="513.31" dur="4.5">whole entire balance because Trump was</text>
  <text start="516.49" dur="5.479">elected and he was going to bring back</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="6.3">jobs that is fading away right now and</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="5.741">we know he just can&amp;#39;t bring back</text>
  <text start="524.11" dur="5.46">manufacturing jobs you know by flicking</text>
  <text start="527.71" dur="5.7">a switch it&amp;#39;s a completely impossible</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="7.11">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of the</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="7.679">dumbest kind of money well it is pouring</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="6.9">into stocks with a vengeance and one of</text>
  <text start="541.089" dur="5.25">the traditional signs of a market top is</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="5.37">individual investors finally succumbing</text>
  <text start="546.339" dur="4.681">to the lure of apparently easy money and</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="5.07">pouring their savings into the stock</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="5.16">market in the past this dumb money</text>
  <text start="554.02" dur="5.39">flowed into equity mutual funds in</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="6.33">general but today it&amp;#39;s favoring ETFs and</text>
  <text start="559.41" dur="7.179">this is exactly what we see the insiders</text>
  <text start="562.51" dur="6.66">they sell off and we see the retail</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="4.621">investor come in and thinking that this</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="4.59">is going to continue on things are great</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="4.26">and we see it just not with the stock</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="3.81">market but we also see it in real estate</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="4.35">all those hedge funds and investment</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="5.37">companies that were purchasing real</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="6.9">estate they&amp;#39;re selling their homes</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="6.27">now selling it to speculators flippers</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="4.8">and whatnot and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="589.21" dur="5.01">holding these homes this is what</text>
  <text start="591.52" dur="5.37">happened in 2008 and it is now</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="5.58">accelerating we know that cliff hi</text>
  <text start="596.89" dur="7.08">Charles men are Harry dent James</text>
  <text start="599.8" dur="6.81">rickards David Stockman bank of america</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="4.68">were all out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="606.61" dur="4.92">second half of this year things are</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="5.61">going to rapidly fall apart and it is</text>
  <text start="611.53" dur="4.92">going to accelerate we now have citibank</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="4.56">from we have matt king from citibank</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="3.9">saying that we think you should sell at</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="3.33">this point because the second half of</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="4.83">this year is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="5.52">disaster we even have JP morgan out</text>
  <text start="625.18" dur="5.27">there saying that we see an increasing</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="5.13">risk of sell-off in the near future</text>
  <text start="630.45" dur="5.14">talking about the second half of this</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="4.17">year so when we look at all the pieces</text>
  <text start="635.59" dur="4.08">and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="636.97" dur="5.76">about and we look at every economic</text>
  <text start="639.67" dur="5.37">sector we can see how this is all coming</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="4.95">together right now and the last piece of</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="6.57">the puzzle is the complete collapse of</text>
  <text start="647.68" dur="7.8">the economy this is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="6.48">right now it&amp;#39;s not going to improve its</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="4.92">not going to get better it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="4.38">to all of a sudden magically turn around</text>
  <text start="660.4" dur="4.47">I mean this is what everyone thought</text>
  <text start="662.47" dur="4.83">back in two thousand eight when the Fed</text>
  <text start="664.87" dur="4.41">was out there telling you don&amp;#39;t worry we</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="3.33">have the subprime contain and everyone</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="3">believed in the corporate media saying</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="3.3">oh don&amp;#39;t worry they told us it was all</text>
  <text start="672.28" dur="4.05">completely contained we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="4.14">forecasting any type of recession any</text>
  <text start="676.33" dur="6">time in the future and this is the year</text>
