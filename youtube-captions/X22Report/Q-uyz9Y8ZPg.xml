  <text start="114.66" dur="6.3">letting everyone know that the Muller</text>
  <text start="117.69" dur="6.24">report it&amp;#39;s not what it seems that</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="5.28">Muller knew the FBI knew that many</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="6.18">people knew that there was no Russian</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="6.84">collusion that it was built on fake</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="4.53">information mark meadows confirm what</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="4.62">many have suspected about the Trump</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="6.239">Russia probe for a long time the FBI</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="5.55">knew early on that the foundation of its</text>
  <text start="140.879" dur="4.351">counterintelligence vestigation against</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="6.569">the Trump campaign was built on a</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="7.649">foundation of sand Meadows was out there</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="6.081">saying they knew they knew within 60</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="6.811">days of them opening the investigation</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="5.68">prior to Robert mullet coming on the FBI</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="4.019">the Department of Justice knew that</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="4.95">Christopher Steele was not credible</text>
  <text start="163.709" dur="6.451">the adazi a was not true george</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="6.51">papadapolis was innocent take a listen</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="5.01">to mark meadows they&amp;#39;re good questions</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="4.47">Shawn but I think here&amp;#39;s the problem is</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.1">within 60 days of them opening the</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="6.24">investigation prior to Bob Muller coming</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="5.76">on the FBI and DOJ knew that Christopher</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="5.76">Steele was not credible the dossier was</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="5.64">not not true and and George papadopolis</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="4.23">was innocent and so when you look at</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.71">that foundation it&amp;#39;s all built on a</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="4.71">really a foundation of sand and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="4.53">going to start to show up very soon and</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="6.09">Ken Starr now what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="6.9">doing they are drip-feeding the public</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="4.89">this information to get them caught up</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="3.179">to everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="3.93">researching everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="5.731">looking at and this is going to take</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="4.53">some time now during this time period we</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="1.769">know the deep state they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="3.12">planning</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve been scheming they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="4.71">figure out a way to stop all this now we</text>
  <text start="223.319" dur="3.511">know they can&amp;#39;t continually use their</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="3.18">ammunition there&amp;#39;s just not enough</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="4.11">ammunition to use because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="4.169">know exactly when all of this is going</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.92">to come out and what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="233.069" dur="4.17">doing they&amp;#39;re going to release a lot of</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="3.33">this a little bit at a time so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="5.281">not just going to use all of their</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="6.269">ammunition on this so they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="5.579">of another tactic another way to</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.311">hopefully keep the truth from the</text>
  <text start="248.099" dur="6.451">American people and one of their tactics</text>
  <text start="250.77" dur="7.38">is to attack the alternative media to</text>
  <text start="254.55" dur="6.299">attack YouTube creators to attack those</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.4">on Twitter to attack those individuals</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="4.951">on Facebook now Q has been warning of</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="4.799">this we&amp;#39;ve known of this and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.549">be talking about that in just a moment</text>
  <text start="268.349" dur="5.97">but very interestingly a federal court</text>
  <text start="271.349" dur="7.47">on Friday June 7th in a Freedom of</text>
  <text start="274.319" dur="8.88">Information Act case Judge James Bo&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.819" dur="6.421">burg was deciding public release of over</text>
  <text start="283.199" dur="4.8">two issues related to the memos of</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="3.72">former FBI director James Comey now</text>
  <text start="287.999" dur="3.181">judge Boasberg</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="4.5">was deciding what could be publicly</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="4.109">released meaning current redactions</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="4.199">removed based on two</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="4.68">acted events number one the content of</text>
  <text start="297.659" dur="5.07">Comey memos and number two the</text>
  <text start="299.969" dur="4.95">declarations of lead FBI agent for</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="5.131">Robert Mueller special counsel David</text>
  <text start="304.919" dur="4.23">Archie in describing those memos this is</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.07">coming out of the conservative tree</text>
  <text start="309.149" dur="6.45">house for those who may not be aware</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="7.299">there are so many memos dozens when</text>
  <text start="315.599" dur="6.66">assembled they seem to make up an actual</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="5.791">diary of moment-by-moment events during</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="6.87">the FBI investigation of Trump and this</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="5.819">is documented by James Comey now in the</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="4.981">issue of redactions within the Comey</text>
  <text start="330.839" dur="4.83">memos the judge doesn&amp;#39;t remove them some</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="3.119">are ordered to be removed some are</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="4.381">approved to stay in place</text>
  <text start="337.229" dur="5.93">the Comey memo aspect and the redaction</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="7.229">decision is basically a splitting of the</text>
  <text start="343.159" dur="6.1">entire thing by 50/50 the issues argued</text>
  <text start="347.279" dur="4.73">by the FBI lawyers to keep the Comey man</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="5.851">was hidden surround sources and methods</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="4.99">the judge generally agreed to the</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="4.109">potential for compromise but also</text>
  <text start="356.999" dur="3.81">outlined several sections of reductions</text>
  <text start="359.219" dur="5.07">within the Comey memos where the</text>
  <text start="360.809" dur="7.26">arguments that the FBI is trying to use</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="8.73">they don&amp;#39;t hold up so the judge has read</text>
  <text start="368.069" dur="7.77">the fully unredacted memo content on the</text>
  <text start="373.019" dur="4.65">issue of the Archie declarations there</text>
  <text start="375.839" dur="3.711">is an opportunity for some very</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="5.67">interesting information to service</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="6.19">here&amp;#39;s an example of currently existing</text>
  <text start="383.339" dur="4.17">read actions within the Archie</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.049">declarations let me just read a portion</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="3.75">of this the United States more</text>
  <text start="389.789" dur="4.23">particularly the memos contain</text>
  <text start="391.259" dur="5.64">classified discussions concerning this</text>
  <text start="394.019" dur="4.29">is redacted then it says the code name</text>
  <text start="396.899" dur="2.58">and true identity of a confidential</text>
  <text start="398.309" dur="2.97">source</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="3.48">as well as details of foreign</text>
  <text start="401.279" dur="4.2">intelligence information obtained from</text>
  <text start="402.959" dur="4.92">and through this source by the FBI now</text>
  <text start="405.479" dur="3.99">this part is redacted and it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="407.879" dur="3.27">long it&amp;#39;s probably about five or six</text>
  <text start="409.469" dur="3.331">words and then went on to say</text>
  <text start="411.149" dur="4.14">information about whether the FBI</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="4.169">initiated coverage through the Foreign</text>
  <text start="415.289" dur="4.62">Intelligence Surveillance Act on a</text>
  <text start="416.969" dur="5.31">particular individual all redacted and</text>
  <text start="419.909" dur="4.47">you can see that getting this</text>
  <text start="422.279" dur="5.461">information would be very helpful so</text>
  <text start="424.379" dur="4.361">judge Boasberg has ordered the Archie</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="3.299">declarations to be</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="6.989">fully released to the public without</text>
  <text start="431.039" dur="6.611">redactions that means all those blank</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="5.611">boxes that you know the dark boxes that</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="5.639">are redacted those will be removed there</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="3.93">should be very interesting because we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="4.38">learn a lot from them so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.14">ruling the RG declarations this is the</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="4.981">original declaration outlining to the</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="6.12">court on October 13 2017 why that Comey</text>
  <text start="452.65" dur="4.859">memos must be sealed it is inside this</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="3.6">exhibit where we discover there are many</text>
  <text start="457.509" dur="4.981">more memos than previously understood</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="5.819">and the content of those memos is far</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="5.12">more exhaustive because James Comey</text>
  <text start="464.949" dur="6.72">documented the FBI investigation</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="8.2">basically what Comey did he created all</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="6.141">these empty Moe&amp;#39;s to cover his ass FBI</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="5.579">agent Archie then goes on to explain</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="6.009">what is inside the memos it is in this</text>
  <text start="481.389" dur="4.741">section where we discover that Comey</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="5.371">made notes of his meeting and</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="4.56">conversations with investigators along</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="3.3">with writing notes of the meetings and</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="3.74">conversations apparently Comey also made</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="5.16">notes of the sources and methods</text>
  <text start="494.43" dur="5.65">associated with the investigation why</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="5.25">would Comey generate classified</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="6.63">information in these notes sources and</text>
  <text start="502.9" dur="5.579">methods unless he was just covering his</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="5.61">ass because he knew the investigation</text>
  <text start="508.479" dur="6.841">itself was a huge risk the content of</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="5.73">the memo seems rather exhaustive it</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="4.44">appears Comey is keeping a diary for use</text>
  <text start="518.05" dur="2.46">in the event this operation went</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="4.56">sideways</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="6.59">so he was documenting everything and all</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="6.41">the information now is in the redacted</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="5.44">parts of his memos which eventually if</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="6.37">everything goes as planned</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="8.45">everyone will actually see now Devon</text>
