  <text start="101.69" dur="4.26">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="3.81">now a couple days ago jamie dimon came</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="3.87">out and he said that bitcoin was a</text>
  <text start="107.42" dur="6.119">complete fraud and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="6.18">bitcoin took a dive and it came down in</text>
  <text start="113.539" dur="5.521">value other cryptocurrencies came down</text>
  <text start="116" dur="5.79">in value and basically what I see</text>
  <text start="119.06" dur="4.949">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="121.79" dur="4.56">lower the price of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="124.009" dur="4.14">because they actually want to purchase</text>
  <text start="126.35" dur="4.46">more and this is what these individuals</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="6.06">actually do they make people believe</text>
  <text start="130.81" dur="5.92">that you know this is a fraud don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="4.831">into it sell it right now and when they</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="3.66">see the price dropping people get out of</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="3.419">it actually you should be getting into</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="4.23">it at this time not when the price is</text>
  <text start="142.459" dur="4.171">going up but when the price is falling</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="7.05">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about what</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="10.29">he says is that JP Morgan is actually</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="6">buying Bitcoin now we know with gold and</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="2.67">silver</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="4.83">we know that JP Morgan&amp;#39;s been buying a</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="5.25">lot of silver we know that Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.14">has been buying a lot of gold and they</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="3.39">put out these announcements to make the</text>
  <text start="166.64" dur="5.04">price go down so they can purchase even</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="5.64">more and when we look at what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="6.21">been doing and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="6.959">Nasdaq Stockholm we can see that Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="3.54">is actively traded there and guess who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.829" dur="3.81">buying</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="4.96">well it&amp;#39;s JP Morgan securities they were</text>
  <text start="184.639" dur="4.891">the fourth big</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="6">buyer which suggests two scenarios</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="5.55">JPMorgan is buying for its own account</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="6.09">at Diamond manipulated lower prices or</text>
  <text start="195.08" dur="5.11">JPMorgan is out there buying for clients</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="4.16">even though they were telling everyone</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="4.68">that bitcoin was a complete fraud and</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="4.09">they&amp;#39;re committing fraud against their</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="3.69">clients because they&amp;#39;re telling everyone</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s a fraud but they&amp;#39;re actually buying</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="5.73">Bitcoin I think it&amp;#39;s number one and I</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="5.55">think they are buying for themselves</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="5.16">they wanted the prices lower he came out</text>
  <text start="216.99" dur="5.46">with the statement and this is what</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="4.44">these individuals do they put out these</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="2.61">announcements they have a lot of power</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="3.3">when it goes over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="3.48">and a lot of people believe this they</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="5.31">have done it with precious metals for a</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="6.15">very long time now in the retail market</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="5.16">with the economy we can see that things</text>
  <text start="234.69" dur="5.67">are rapidly deteriorating toys-r-us</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="5.64">right now has entered a death spiral now</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="5.22">a week ago we talked about Toys R Us and</text>
  <text start="243.3" dur="4.5">how they hired a bankruptcy law a law</text>
  <text start="245.58" dur="4.61">firm Kirkland and Ellis to help</text>
  <text start="247.8" dur="4.8">restructure its heavy debt load and</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="5.019">since they&amp;#39;ve done that their bond</text>
  <text start="252.6" dur="3.96">prices completely collapsed and what</text>
  <text start="255.209" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="5.28">to restructure before the all-important</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="3.9">holiday season but I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re gonna get there I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re gonna see a surge in sales</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="6.09">during this holiday season and I think</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re gonna enter chapter 11 now what</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="4.86">we know about the retail industry it is</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="6.14">completely falling apart now Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="277.08" dur="6.08">will be now added to the list of 25</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="5.769">retailers that have declared bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="6.28">whore restructuring and those include</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="6.511">route 21 Gymboree payless shoes and many</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="5.31">many others and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="4.11">entire retail market is falling apart</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s really not going to online</text>
  <text start="296.79" dur="6.45">because online is only 10% of the</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="6.27">trillion-dollar retail business so when</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="4.77">you hear who Amazon is making you know</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="5.79">twenty billion dollars or fifty billion</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="6.45">dollars that&amp;#39;s chump change compared to</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="6.36">the entire retail market but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="5.069">using this to convince you that this is</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="4.859">why retail is self</text>
  <text start="319.529" dur="5.49">no retail is suffering because people</text>
  <text start="322.619" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t have the high earn the higher</text>
  <text start="325.019" dur="4.41">paying jobs people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="327.449" dur="3">people are being laid off in retail</text>
  <text start="329.429" dur="2.73">people are being laid off in</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="2.97">manufacturing people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="3.27">and they&amp;#39;re getting jobs as waiters</text>
  <text start="333.419" dur="3.3">waitresses and they&amp;#39;re making a little</text>
  <text start="335.429" dur="3.63">bit of money a lot of people had</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="5.55">full-time jobs they&amp;#39;re making part-time</text>
  <text start="339.059" dur="5.28">cash and it&amp;#39;s very difficult to survive</text>
  <text start="342.269" dur="3.78">and go out and purchase these goods this</text>
  <text start="344.339" dur="3.8">is what&amp;#39;s been happening for a very long</text>
  <text start="346.049" dur="5.61">time they just don&amp;#39;t want to admit it</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="6.91">now we know the global debt problem is</text>
  <text start="351.659" dur="6.33">gigantic I mean it is astronomical right</text>
  <text start="355.049" dur="6.09">now this is coming out of the latest</text>
  <text start="357.989" dur="5.91">published report that the IAF found that</text>
  <text start="361.139" dur="6.75">the total nominal global debt has risen</text>
  <text start="363.899" dur="7.52">to a null an all-time new high of 217</text>
  <text start="367.889" dur="6.06">trillion or 327 percent of global GDP</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="6.1">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="373.949" dur="7.31">is that the Biz have has found that</text>
  <text start="377.519" dur="8.58">global debt may be underreported by 14</text>
  <text start="381.259" dur="7.15">trillion dollars now every day trillions</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="4.68">of dollars are borrowed and lent in</text>
  <text start="388.409" dur="6.18">various currencies many deals take place</text>
  <text start="390.779" dur="6.87">in the cash market and with all what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.589" dur="5.79">interesting about all this is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.649" dur="4.77">not being tracked for the US dollar</text>
  <text start="400.379" dur="4.35">alone contracts worth tens of trillions</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="4.74">of dollars staying open and trillions</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="4.53">change hands daily and yet one cannot</text>
  <text start="407.159" dur="5.88">find these amounts on the balance sheets</text>
  <text start="409.259" dur="6.18">this debt is in effect missing and as a</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="5.24">result we know little about it how much</text>
  <text start="415.439" dur="5.7">is owed by whom and for what purpose and</text>
  <text start="418.279" dur="6.97">they&amp;#39;re calculating right now is that</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="7.35">there&amp;#39;s 14 trillion dollars more debt</text>
  <text start="425.249" dur="5.01">than is being reported right now so we</text>
  <text start="428.489" dur="4.08">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of that out there we</text>
  <text start="430.259" dur="4.08">know that it&amp;#39;s unsustainable and we</text>
  <text start="432.569" dur="4.95">could see that it&amp;#39;s much much higher</text>
  <text start="434.339" dur="6.6">than they&amp;#39;re actually telling us this is</text>
  <text start="437.519" dur="5.85">why they&amp;#39;re pushing and going in the</text>
  <text start="440.939" dur="5.46">direction of trying to get us into a war</text>
  <text start="443.369" dur="4.83">as quickly as possible because the</text>
  <text start="446.399" dur="4.08">central banks they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="448.199" dur="4.411">blamed for what is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="2.791">that is the system is going to come</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="3.69">crashing down</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="4.89">now Afghanistan is turning away from the</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="4.86">United States they&amp;#39;re moving closer</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="4.65">towards Russia and they&amp;#39;re teaming up</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="3.93">with Russia and Russia&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="4.859">supplying Afghanistan the government of</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="5.49">Afghanistan with military military</text>
  <text start="467.669" dur="4.62">helicopters they&amp;#39;re gonna be bringing in</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="4.82">all different types of military assets</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="6.301">and they want Russia to assist in</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="5.829">fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="478.59" dur="4.859">so we see already that countries are now</text>
  <text start="481.229" dur="4.261">moving away from the u.s. saying you</text>
  <text start="483.449" dur="5.461">know something Russia has been very</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="6.72">successful in fighting terrorism they</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="6.09">got rid of the terrorists 85% of the</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="5.16">land has been liberated in Syria they</text>
  <text start="495" dur="4.08">only have 15% left and we can see</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ve been very successful in a short</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="4.26">period of time compared to the United</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="4.44">States that has been in Syria for a very</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="4.949">long time and during that period the</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="5.489">Islamic state has expanded their</text>
  <text start="508.289" dur="4.981">territory so who would you want fighting</text>
  <text start="511.169" dur="4.411">terrorists you would want the country</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.439">that was successful and that is Russia</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re pivoting towards</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="5.791">Russia now we see that Russia has kicked</text>
  <text start="520.62" dur="6.42">off the Zap at 2017 military exercise</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s a huge military exercise and the</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="4.41">United States well they&amp;#39;re delivering</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="4.32">hundreds of tanks and howitzers to</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="3.9">Poland right now and that is being</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="3.69">delivered at the same exact time because</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for their exercise</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="5.04">and basically Russia is performing these</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="5.28">exercises on their own land while the</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="4.98">United States through NATO is performing</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="5.699">these exercises right at the border of</text>
  <text start="547.14" dur="5.639">Russia and that is the big difference we</text>
  <text start="550.589" dur="3.24">see that North Korea right now is saying</text>
  <text start="552.779" dur="3.601">that they will not stop their nuclear</text>
  <text start="553.829" dur="5.07">program until achieving parity with the</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="4.32">u.s. basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="558.899" dur="3.81">that they&amp;#39;re going to keep pushing</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="3.78">forward until they have a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="562.709" dur="4.291">that they can put on a missile that</text>
  <text start="564.48" dur="4.32">actually works right now they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="567" dur="3.63">that and they want to equal the United</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="4.229">States because this way if they can do</text>
  <text start="570.63" dur="4.5">this they will prevent regime change in</text>
  <text start="573.029" dur="6.031">their in their country and they</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="7.23">know this now South Korea they are right</text>
  <text start="579.06" dur="5.639">now getting prepared for some type of an</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="4.589">attack from the north now North Korea is</text>
  <text start="584.699" dur="3.011">not going to attack South Korea because</text>
  <text start="586.949" dur="3.281">if they</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="5.34">North Korea would be obliterated in a</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="5.13">second but the corporate media these</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="4.98">government idiots they are really</text>
  <text start="595.36" dur="3.78">pushing the agenda to make you scared to</text>
  <text start="598.03" dur="1.92">make you think that something is going</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="2.64">to happen and the only way that</text>
  <text start="599.95" dur="5.13">something&amp;#39;s going to happen is if they</text>
  <text start="601.78" dur="5.73">create it but right now South Korea they</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="4.71">are preparing for an electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="607.51" dur="4.71">pulse attack they&amp;#39;re preparing for a</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="5.22">biochemical attack they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="5.94">pretty much everything because they</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="5.82">believe that the north the North Koreans</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="5.07">are going to actually attack South Korea</text>
  <text start="620.83" dur="5.19">which would be absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="4.35">first of all if they actually do this</text>
  <text start="626.02" dur="4.08">and they go through with it and they</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="3.75">fire missiles at South Korea first of</text>
  <text start="630.1" dur="3.72">all the United States is going to get</text>
  <text start="631.33" dur="6.09">involved NATO is going to get involved</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="6.99">and North Korea will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="637.42" dur="5.28">because once that starts we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="2.91">going to see China and Russia well</text>
  <text start="642.7" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re going to come to the aid of</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="4.32">North Korea and North Korea is going to</text>
  <text start="645.7" dur="4.95">be in the center of this and North Korea</text>

  <text start="650.65" dur="4.98">seconds they will not be able to survive</text>
  <text start="652.54" dur="6.41">the attack and if Russia and China see</text>
  <text start="655.63" dur="5.7">the United States NATO South Korea</text>
  <text start="658.95" dur="3.43">building up military forces getting</text>
  <text start="661.33" dur="2.34">ready to go in because they have</text>
  <text start="662.38" dur="3.06">satellites all over the place they</text>

  <text start="665.44" dur="4.62">communications they understand what is</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="5.1">going on guess what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="5.49">back North Korea they&amp;#39;re gonna step in</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="5.55">and they&amp;#39;re gonna shut this down and the</text>
  <text start="675.55" dur="4.23">United States knows this this is why</text>
  <text start="677.71" dur="3.93">they haven&amp;#39;t made a move as of yet they</text>
  <text start="679.78" dur="6.09">also know that Russia has the technology</text>
  <text start="681.64" dur="6.62">to shut down ships to bring the</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="5.58">electronic systems to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="688.26" dur="4.3">they also understand that Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="691.45" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s not crazy</text>
  <text start="692.56" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s not going to start a war what they</text>
  <text start="695.77" dur="5.67">really want to do is they want to create</text>
  <text start="698.14" dur="6.03">and maintain nuclear weapons to prevent</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="4.41">the Cabal from coming in and having</text>
  <text start="704.17" dur="4.32">regime change in North Korea</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="5.55">now we&amp;#39;ve mentioned before that there</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="7.62">are many countries that are bypassing</text>
  <text start="711.4" dur="8.67">the dollar and even though Iran is using</text>
  <text start="716.11" dur="5.34">yuyuan ruble gold for trade for their</text>
  <text start="720.07" dur="3.15">natural resources</text>
  <text start="721.45" dur="4.56">the United States continually places</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="5.46">sanctions on a ram well it looks like</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="5.13">they are sidestepping these sanctions</text>
  <text start="728.68" dur="4.65">completely now remember Russia and China</text>
  <text start="731.14" dur="4.59">they created these banking system that</text>
  <text start="733.33" dur="5.16">the BRICS the AEI be and they are</text>
  <text start="735.73" dur="5.97">loaning currency to these different</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="5.97">countries then right now China has</text>
  <text start="741.7" dur="4.92">opened a 10 billion credit line with</text>
  <text start="744.46" dur="5.49">Iran now they&amp;#39;re gonna be trading in</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="6.03">Euros and you want which completely</text>
  <text start="749.95" dur="5.76">bypasses the United States and the</text>
  <text start="752.65" dur="5.43">dollar which means that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="755.71" dur="6.06">bypass the US sanctions they will have</text>
  <text start="758.08" dur="5.91">no effect whatsoever so already</text>
  <text start="761.77" dur="4.05">countries are like you know something we</text>
  <text start="763.99" dur="3.72">know how to get around this North Korea</text>
  <text start="765.82" dur="3.84">is using Bitcoin they&amp;#39;re selling drugs</text>
  <text start="767.71" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re getting different currencies in</text>
  <text start="769.66" dur="4.47">and again sanctions no longer actually</text>
  <text start="772.84" dur="2.49">they have never worked but they are not</text>
  <text start="774.13" dur="4.98">working anymore</text>
  <text start="775.33" dur="6.78">the bully on the street is being pushed</text>
  <text start="779.11" dur="5.43">back now and that is the Cabal they it</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="6.51">looks like at this point they have no</text>
  <text start="784.54" dur="8.1">power we see there is a race for dare</text>
  <text start="788.62" dur="6.78">Azure now according to the US corporate</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="6">media they&amp;#39;re reporting that Russia</text>
  <text start="795.4" dur="6.21">attacked the Syrian democratic forces</text>
  <text start="798.64" dur="4.41">now the SDF these are the forces that</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="3.03">the United States created they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="803.05" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re mostly made up of Syrians right</text>
  <text start="804.64" dur="6.36">now and they were fighting and moving</text>
  <text start="808.03" dur="4.95">towards dara&amp;#39;a or their forces were east</text>
  <text start="811" dur="4.56">of Euphrates and they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="812.98" dur="6.3">were hit by Russian aircraft and the</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="5.9">Syrian forces and Russia saying yeah</text>
  <text start="819.28" dur="7.02">this is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="821.46" dur="8.11">first of all we notified the United</text>
  <text start="826.3" dur="6.21">States the Pentagon that we were going</text>
  <text start="829.57" dur="5.7">to bomb in this area we were going after</text>
  <text start="832.51" dur="4.92">the terrorists and Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="835.27" dur="4.98">saying that they did this to avoid</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="4.2">unnecessary escalation the command of</text>
  <text start="840.25" dur="2.85">the Russian troops in Surrey revealed</text>
  <text start="841.63" dur="3.18">that the boundaries of the military</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="3.15">operation in dare resort to the American</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="3.66">partners through the existing</text>
  <text start="846.25" dur="4.89">communication channel this came from the</text>
  <text start="848.47" dur="4.2">Russian Defense Ministry and they are</text>
  <text start="851.14" dur="4.05">saying that within their framework of</text>
  <text start="852.67" dur="4.89">operation the fighters armored vehicle</text>
  <text start="855.19" dur="3.93">and objects of terrorists are being</text>
  <text start="857.56" dur="4.08">destroyed on both Western and Eastern</text>
  <text start="859.12" dur="5.16">banks of Euphrates now the United States</text>
  <text start="861.64" dur="4.5">knew all about this they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="864.28" dur="3.06">where the Russians were going to be they</text>
  <text start="866.14" dur="3.21">knew exactly where the Russians were</text>
  <text start="867.34" dur="4.65">going to attack and it looks like this</text>
  <text start="869.35" dur="4.5">was completely set up so the corporate</text>
  <text start="871.99" dur="4.56">media can go out there and say oh my god</text>
  <text start="873.85" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re bombing the SDF but this is not</text>
  <text start="876.55" dur="3.99">true they were notified they knew what</text>
  <text start="879.07" dur="3.45">was happening they knew where the</text>
  <text start="880.54" dur="4.44">Russians were gonna be and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="882.52" dur="4.23">this to make it seem like that Russia is</text>
  <text start="884.98" dur="3.96">doing this but this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="886.75" dur="6.09">phony and false this is a last-ditch</text>
  <text start="888.94" dur="6.72">attempt to show that Russia is actually</text>
  <text start="892.84" dur="4.17">bombing the grassroots uprising and by</text>
  <text start="895.66" dur="4.56">the way these Syrian democratic forces</text>
  <text start="897.01" dur="5.91">was just created about maybe a year ago</text>
  <text start="900.22" dur="4.92">or so at this point so this is not all</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="5.4">of a sudden they just came out of</text>
  <text start="905.14" dur="5.61">nowhere they were created by the United</text>
  <text start="908.32" dur="4.74">States because they were getting flack</text>
  <text start="910.75" dur="4.71">that the moderate rebels they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="913.06" dur="4.29">Syrian and they created a whole new</text>
  <text start="915.46" dur="5.91">force to say yes these are the Syrians</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="7.02">90% are Syrian so right now the cabal is</text>
  <text start="921.37" dur="5.22">losing power they have no power right</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="5.76">now and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="926.59" dur="4.98">possibly can to push this war along but</text>
  <text start="930.13" dur="2.73">right now it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="931.57" dur="3.78">working the only thing that they can do</text>
  <text start="932.86" dur="5.19">at this point is have some type of an</text>
  <text start="935.35" dur="4.98">event in North Korea and it looks like</text>
  <text start="938.05" dur="3.57">this is what they&amp;#39;re pushing for this is</text>
  <text start="940.33" dur="3.63">why they were out there reporting that</text>
  <text start="941.62" dur="5.28">there the North Koreans fired a missile</text>
  <text start="943.96" dur="4.68">now they can reach Guam and it looks</text>
  <text start="946.9" dur="4.8">like they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="948.64" dur="5.19">to create this event and again it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="951.7" dur="4.56">slow process where they have to show and</text>
  <text start="953.83" dur="4.5">prove that North Korea can actually do</text>
  <text start="956.26" dur="4.14">this and who knows where this missile</text>
  <text start="958.33" dur="3.87">will actually be fired from it could be</text>
  <text start="960.4" dur="4.08">fired from the ocean they could say it</text>
  <text start="962.2" dur="4.95">was from one of North Korea&amp;#39;s subs and</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="4.44">no one would ever know just like all the</text>
  <text start="967.15" dur="3.84">other false flags until it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="968.92" dur="3.54">but we&amp;#39;ve been following this we</text>
  <text start="970.99" dur="4.11">understand what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="972.46" dur="5.13">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they push</text>
  <text start="975.1" dur="3.69">this to the next level and this is what</text>
  <text start="977.59" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;ve been watching because as we know</text>
  <text start="978.79" dur="4.92">the economy is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="980.65" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s in a death spiral right now retail</text>
  <text start="983.71" dur="4.35">is a complete disaster housing is gonna</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="4.68">be coming down rents are coming down</text>
  <text start="988.06" dur="4.92">tax revenues are declining GDP is a</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="3.84">complete and utter disaster and all</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="3.42">these numbers are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="994.57" dur="4.02">think about it if these were the real</text>
  <text start="996.4" dur="4.32">numbers and they were telling us what</text>
  <text start="998.59" dur="5.76">was really going on they were already</text>
  <text start="1000.72" dur="5.28">say we collapsed but again as long as</text>
  <text start="1004.35" dur="3.09">they can keep the stock market up and</text>
  <text start="1006" dur="3.81">they can give us manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="1007.44" dur="6.69">everyone believes that everything is</text>
  <text start="1009.81" dur="7.62">fine but in reality we are worse off</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="4.74">than 2008 right now all the indicators a</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="5.46">lot of the indicators that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1018.87" dur="7.11">are equal to or a lot worse than they</text>
  <text start="1022.89" dur="6.48">were in 2008 and everyone is going to be</text>
  <text start="1025.98" dur="7.02">shocked when all of a sudden the truth</text>
