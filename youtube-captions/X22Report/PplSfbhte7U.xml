  <text start="47.8" dur="6.53">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="51.55" dur="5.6">report my name is David this is episode</text>
  <text start="54.33" dur="5.23">1219 B and today&amp;#39;s date is March 3rd</text>
  <text start="57.15" dur="4.6">2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="59.56" dur="5.18">central bankers in the deep state move</text>
  <text start="61.75" dur="5.76">forward with an internet kill switch</text>
  <text start="64.74" dur="6.16">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="67.51" dur="6.359">political ng of political news now we</text>
  <text start="70.9" dur="5.55">can see that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="73.869" dur="5.641">establishment the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="76.45" dur="7.01">are pushing their agenda like never</text>
  <text start="79.51" dur="6.96">before now we know as we go back in time</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="5.68">before the elections during the</text>
  <text start="86.47" dur="6.63">elections right after the elections they</text>
  <text start="89.14" dur="8.009">tried all different ways to deliver it</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="6.42">amide Trump and they tried to make it</text>
  <text start="97.149" dur="4.651">look like well the elections really</text>
  <text start="99.52" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t happen and Trump really is not</text>
  <text start="101.8" dur="4.13">the president and that completely all</text>
  <text start="103.75" dur="4.979">failed I mean they did the cyber</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="4.36">attacking by Russia Russia was</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="5.041">interfering interfering with the</text>
  <text start="110.29" dur="6.99">elections that the electors needed to be</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="6.51">briefed on the cyber attacks that Trump</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="5.91">had relations with Russia he was talking</text>
  <text start="120.28" dur="5.399">to Russia and it just went on and on and</text>
  <text start="123.19" dur="6.9">on and what&amp;#39;s very interesting after</text>
  <text start="125.679" dur="6.541">Trump had his speech we saw right</text>
  <text start="130.09" dur="7.53">afterwards and I think there was even a</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="8.37">poll on CNN that 70% of individuals said</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="5.97">they feel a lot better with Trump right</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="4.95">now and they really couldn&amp;#39;t see you it</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.14">or do anything to it and we can see</text>
  <text start="145.54" dur="5.15">right now that this witch hunt that</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re on is kind of like a distraction</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="7.84">to reset everything back the way they</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="6.93">want it because remember those in power</text>
  <text start="158.53" dur="5.52">have lost their power and they want it</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="4.11">back</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="4.62">so what are they doing well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="4.74">doing exactly what we thought they were</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="6.69">going to do they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="6.56">to remove Trump and we can see that</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re on a witch hunt it reminds me of</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="5.47">the McCarthyism</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="4.5">back in the 50s when Senator Joseph</text>
  <text start="183.82" dur="5.46">McCarthy led a hunt for a purported</text>
  <text start="185.8" dur="6.63">communist in the US government and of</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="6.09">course it involved unfounded accusations</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="6.48">isn&amp;#39;t that what we&amp;#39;re seeing today the</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="6.15">same exact thing and remember all the</text>
  <text start="198.91" dur="5.91">sources are anonymous there is no proof</text>
  <text start="201.52" dur="4.74">whatsoever but you have to remember they</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t need proof they just need the</text>
  <text start="206.26" dur="4.02">headlines they just need the propaganda</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="4.29">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re saying that these individuals</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="6.15">are guilty first without proof and then</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="3.57">they have to prove their innocence</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.32">instead of the other way around where</text>
  <text start="220.6" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re innocent and they have to prove</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="8.25">their guilt because right now they have</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="8.4">shown no proof whatsoever everything</text>
  <text start="231.07" dur="6.33">that they&amp;#39;re bringing up is not proof of</text>
  <text start="234.49" dur="5.9">anything we already know noona says</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="6.21">there&amp;#39;s no connection between Trump and</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="5.62">Russia we already know that the FBI is</text>
  <text start="243.61" dur="5.28">saying that they have no information or</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="6.48">or anything that Russia interfered with</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="6.9">the elections and at this point this is</text>
  <text start="252.49" dur="5.94">just a witch-hunt and Russia is even out</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="4.949">there saying that yes this is a wish a</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="4.86">witch-hunt and they&amp;#39;re just going after</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="4.171">the administration and this is just</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="4.14">going to get worse as time goes on just</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="5.61">like we thought now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="5.25">through phase one where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="5">through the legal process let&amp;#39;s find</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="5.79">something on Trump or one of his</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="4.72">administration staff and let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="4.95">through the process of dealer genome</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="5.79">izing accusing and making connections</text>
  <text start="283.42" dur="4.44">now so far they can&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="3.03">connections but they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="3.75">use this and go through the legal</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="6.35">process to impeach Trump this is phase</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="7.62">one phase two if that doesn&amp;#39;t work I</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="7.39">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they scare</text>
  <text start="299.23" dur="6.12">Trump and what I mean by that is they</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="6.78">try to assassinate but don&amp;#39;t assassinate</text>
  <text start="305.35" dur="9.27">him give him the scare of his life to</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="9.09">make him go along with what they want</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="8.07">now this might be on his life or maybe</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="6.57">his family&amp;#39;s life this is how desperate</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re going to get because once the</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="6.27">legal Avenue goes absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="9.18">they&amp;#39;re going to be very very desperate</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="10.02">and they will try to scare him to see if</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="7.47">they can bring them in line and if that</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="6.21">doesn&amp;#39;t work they will most likely go to</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="5.28">the next level and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="6.63">this play out throughout this whole</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="8.13">entire year now Trump he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.96">show how ridiculous all this is he</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="5.82">tweeted a picture of Schumer Chuck</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.67">Schumer and Putin they&amp;#39;re eating a</text>
  <text start="364" dur="6.5">doughnut this was taken back in 2003 and</text>
  <text start="367" dur="6.44">he was out there saying look at this</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="5.26">Schumer is with Russian President Putin</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="5.94">we should call for an immediate</text>
  <text start="375.76" dur="6">investigation he met with a Russian and</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="4.66">we can see at this point Schumer</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="5.34">actually tweeted back saying well this</text>
  <text start="384.04" dur="7.05">photo was taken back in 2003 and it was</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="6.09">out in the public but the point of the</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="5.4">whole entire thing was just because</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re with someone who&amp;#39;s Russian</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="7.23">doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s an investigation</text>
  <text start="398.41" dur="8.16">and with sessions he meets with a lot of</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="4.71">individuals because he was on the u.s.</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="5.16">arms committee and he meets with</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.52">ambassadors now is it always in public</text>
  <text start="411.73" dur="4.2">no again we don&amp;#39;t know what Schumer did</text>
  <text start="413.95" dur="4.17">with Putin in private</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="5.55">yeah they show him eating a doughnut</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="7.62">that was staged but he&amp;#39;s trying to show</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="6.06">everyone how ridiculous this is because</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="3.99">if you really want to go back in time</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="5.25">and you really want to call each</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="4.8">individual up of who they met in private</text>
  <text start="432.79" dur="4.17">without being in a public photograph</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="5.67">believe me you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="5.94">individuals now CNN is taking this even</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="5.19">further and we know that CNN is fake</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="4.5">news Washington Post fake news and</text>
  <text start="445.39" dur="2.739">they&amp;#39;re trying to say that the Russian</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="4.409">and bass</text>
  <text start="448.129" dur="6.99">is one of Russia&amp;#39;s top spies in</text>
  <text start="451.809" dur="6.551">Washington what is there proof they</text>
  <text start="455.119" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t have any how did they arrive at</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="5.789">this conclusion they were told this by</text>
  <text start="461.689" dur="5.37">an unnamed current and former senior US</text>
  <text start="464.149" dur="5.431">government official in other words this</text>
  <text start="467.059" dur="4.89">is yet another example of fake news</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="4.649">story with groundbreaking allegations</text>
  <text start="471.949" dur="4.83">and zero evidence this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="5.97">doing right now because propaganda does</text>
  <text start="476.779" dur="7.831">not need facts evidence to back it up</text>
  <text start="480.199" dur="7.95">remember in 2013 there was a law passed</text>
  <text start="484.61" dur="6.299">that yes the US government the corporate</text>
  <text start="488.149" dur="6.24">media can use propaganda on the American</text>
  <text start="490.909" dur="6.27">people and they just want the headlines</text>
  <text start="494.389" dur="5.79">out there they just want people to see</text>
  <text start="497.179" dur="5.46">it because most of the people will never</text>
  <text start="500.179" dur="4.32">ask for facts they will never say is</text>
  <text start="502.639" dur="4.62">this true or not if the corporate media</text>
  <text start="504.499" dur="4.35">is saying it must be true but the</text>
  <text start="507.259" dur="3.33">alternative media right now is breaking</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="4.47">it down and saying you know something</text>
  <text start="510.589" dur="5.041">let&amp;#39;s see the proof let&amp;#39;s see the facts</text>
  <text start="513.319" dur="5.791">and so far everything that we&amp;#39;ve delve</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="5.939">into we found absolutely nothing now</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="4.14">trey Gowdy said something very</text>
  <text start="521.569" dur="5.221">interesting he appeared on Fox&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="6.48">100 days and he was in a closed-door</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.71">briefing earlier with FBI director James</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="4.289">Comey concerning the agency&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.35">investigation into claims of Russian</text>
  <text start="534.019" dur="6.391">interference in the 2016 election and</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="4.719">Gowdy was out there saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="4.799">never heard a federal law enforcement</text>
  <text start="542.569" dur="5.52">agent give with that degree of</text>
  <text start="545.209" dur="6.24">particularity and detail an update of an</text>
  <text start="548.089" dur="6">inquiry and he says you may recall I was</text>
  <text start="551.449" dur="5.94">a federal prosecutor for six years I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="5.55">talked to lots of FBI agents he went so</text>
  <text start="557.389" dur="4.711">far beyond what any other Administration</text>
  <text start="559.639" dur="4.82">official has ever done whether it&amp;#39;s Eric</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.339">Holder Loretta Lynch or his predecessor</text>
  <text start="564.459" dur="4.841">predecessor Robert Mueller they never</text>
  <text start="567.439" dur="5.76">gave us this level of detail and</text>
  <text start="569.3" dur="7.83">specificity call me bent over backwards</text>
  <text start="573.199" dur="6.601">to do this when pressed on whether or</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="4.61">not FBI director Comey revealed any new</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="6.95">information in light of John</text>
  <text start="581.74" dur="6.6">Brennan or James clapper finding no</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="4.26">evidence of collusion between the Trump</text>
  <text start="588.34" dur="5.19">campaign and the Russians Gowdy said I</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="4.89">will tell you this to the extent people</text>
  <text start="593.53" dur="4.05">are relying on the media reports whether</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s the New York Times or The</text>
  <text start="597.58" dur="6.06">Washington Post upon which to base their</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="6.6">factual assertions I would tell them to</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="5.49">be very very careful I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="3.6">say any more than that other than to say</text>
  <text start="609.13" dur="4.08">that the person leading the</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="4.98">investigation on behalf of the US</text>
  <text start="613.21" dur="6.3">government the head of the FBI listen to</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="6.27">what he has to say and right now they</text>
  <text start="619.51" dur="4.05">have found no connections whatsoever in</text>
  <text start="621.97" dur="5.49">regards to Russia</text>
  <text start="623.56" dur="6.33">Trump nothing nothing at all and to</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="4.05">remind everyone whoever is leaking any</text>
  <text start="629.89" dur="7.02">of this information from the White House</text>
  <text start="631.51" dur="7.79">that is against the law and we can see</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="6.93">right now gaudí</text>
  <text start="639.3" dur="7.45">he is advising people who rely on the</text>
  <text start="643.84" dur="6.57">leaks to be very very careful in doing</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="6.42">so and he can&amp;#39;t say anymore and it looks</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="6.51">like they might be on to whoever is</text>
  <text start="653.17" dur="6.69">doing this now we know most likely this</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="7.71">is in connection with Obama with the</text>
  <text start="659.86" dur="7.53">deep state with Soros trying to push</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="5.73">their agenda because as we know Obama</text>
  <text start="667.39" dur="6.15">Eric Holder they are getting together</text>
  <text start="670.36" dur="5.76">right now to push their agenda I mean</text>
  <text start="673.54" dur="5.61">think about what just happened after</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="5.16">Trump took the White House Obama was</text>
  <text start="679.15" dur="4.86">supposed to move back to Hawaii but</text>
  <text start="681.28" dur="5.04">instead he decided to stay in Washington</text>
  <text start="684.01" dur="4.95">DC to purchase a home less than two</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="4.62">miles from the White House I mean many</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="4.47">of his former staff members are either</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="4.98">working directly with him or working for</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="5.52">his political organization organizing</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="5.73">for action and a particular concern is</text>
  <text start="698.95" dur="5.73">the fact that Valerie Jarrett has</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="5.85">actually moved into Obama&amp;#39;s five million</text>
  <text start="704.68" dur="5.04">dollar home which many read which many</text>
  <text start="707.5" dur="5.73">are referring to as Obama&amp;#39;s anti Trump</text>
  <text start="709.72" dur="5.97">command center now Obama&amp;#39;s goal and this</text>
  <text start="713.23" dur="5.04">is according to a close family friend</text>
  <text start="715.69" dur="4.86">is to house Trump from the presidency</text>
  <text start="718.27" dur="6">either by forcing his resignation or</text>
  <text start="720.55" dur="5.55">through his impeachment and Obama is</text>
  <text start="724.27" dur="6.02">being aided in his political crusade by</text>
  <text start="726.1" dur="7.74">his longtime friend Valerie Jarrett and</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="6.16">we can see that former attorney General</text>
  <text start="733.84" dur="6.03">Eric Holder says Barack Obama is rested</text>
  <text start="736.45" dur="8.25">and ready to roll down he&amp;#39;s ready to go</text>
  <text start="739.87" dur="5.87">after Trump now the question is why is</text>
  <text start="744.7" dur="4.92">he doing it</text>
  <text start="745.74" dur="6.76">what is he nervous about and what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="749.62" dur="5.85">agenda now one thing that Obama might be</text>
  <text start="752.5" dur="5.22">worried about is this new investigation</text>
  <text start="755.47" dur="4.92">now we mentioned this briefly yesterday</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="5.37">about the slush fund in the Department</text>

  <text start="763.09" dur="6.05">well it looks like they&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="765.4" dur="6.63">investigation after it was revealed that</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="6.67">billions of dollars of taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="772.03" dur="5.93">was funneled into a shadowy Department</text>
  <text start="775.81" dur="4.92">of Justice slush fund and then</text>
  <text start="777.96" dur="5.83">distributed to a number of left-wing</text>
  <text start="780.73" dur="5.67">activist groups now the Republicans on</text>
  <text start="783.79" dur="5.94">the House Judiciary Committee well they</text>
  <text start="786.4" dur="6.54">are looking at this and looking out how</text>
  <text start="789.73" dur="7.26">Obama handed out billions of dollars to</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="6.42">given groups and we know that Mike</text>
  <text start="796.99" dur="5.13">Huckabee the former governor of Arkansas</text>
  <text start="799.36" dur="5.55">said the revelations leave Obama in very</text>
  <text start="802.12" dur="4.8">hot water if the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="804.91" dur="6.18">Committee takes this inquiry all the way</text>
  <text start="806.92" dur="6.81">criminal charges will be filed so what</text>
  <text start="811.09" dur="5.55">does he do with this money what groups</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="5.609">receive this well we know the National</text>
  <text start="816.64" dur="3.93">Urban League they received it the</text>
  <text start="819.339" dur="5.881">National Community Reinvestment</text>

  <text start="825.22" dur="5.04">National Council Council of La Raza this</text>
  <text start="827.89" dur="4.56">is a Latino advocacy organization that</text>

  <text start="832.45" dur="8.72">changes including immigration reform and</text>
  <text start="836.43" dur="8.98">we can see that these organizations</text>
  <text start="841.17" dur="7.4">altogether looks like he&amp;#39;s going towards</text>
  <text start="845.41" dur="7.98">getting votes for</text>
  <text start="848.57" dur="11.49">his party because we see at this point</text>
  <text start="853.39" dur="11.53">that he was taking this money and using</text>
  <text start="860.06" dur="7.8">it for his own benefit his party&amp;#39;s own</text>
  <text start="864.92" dur="5.76">benefit and this is not something that</text>
  <text start="867.86" dur="5.04">he should be doing this is why there is</text>
  <text start="870.68" dur="6.42">an investigation now this might be just</text>
  <text start="872.9" dur="7.04">the surface of the entire thing because</text>
  <text start="877.1" dur="5.76">we know that there&amp;#39;s probably a lot more</text>
  <text start="879.94" dur="6.37">underneath this because they are working</text>
  <text start="882.86" dur="8.07">very very hard to remove Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="886.31" dur="6.84">from his post and to push this hard to</text>
  <text start="890.93" dur="5.25">remove someone from his post they must</text>
  <text start="893.15" dur="8.94">be worried about information being</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="8.07">discovered now in past reports we talked</text>
  <text start="902.09" dur="4.74">about an intranet kill switch</text>
  <text start="904.25" dur="4.11">we know that DHS has created an internet</text>
  <text start="906.83" dur="4.59">kill switch where they can just shut</text>
  <text start="908.36" dur="4.98">down the internet and we also know</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s different types of internet kill</text>
  <text start="913.34" dur="5.88">switches where they can block certain</text>
  <text start="916.73" dur="8.22">things when people say certain things</text>
  <text start="919.22" dur="8.37">and out in the EU the EU parliament has</text>
  <text start="924.95" dur="6.33">granted its president the right to cut</text>
  <text start="927.59" dur="8.73">the live broadcast of any hate speech or</text>

  <text start="936.32" dur="4.35">kill switch</text>
  <text start="937.67" dur="4.77">now press freedom organizations they</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="3.45">have raised concerns about censorship</text>
  <text start="942.44" dur="4.26">after members of the European Parliament</text>
  <text start="944.12" dur="5.28">approved extraordinary measures to</text>
  <text start="946.7" dur="5.46">combat hey speech but is it really</text>
  <text start="949.4" dur="4.8">against hate speech or do they just want</text>
  <text start="952.16" dur="5.55">to block out certain things that are</text>
  <text start="954.2" dur="7.11">being said because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="957.71" dur="7.05">that gives them a lot of control of just</text>
  <text start="961.31" dur="6.57">shutting down anything now critics say</text>
  <text start="964.76" dur="5.13">the rules are vaguely worded and could</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="6.66">be manipulated or used as a tool of</text>
  <text start="969.89" dur="6.36">censorship well we see many of the</text>
  <text start="974.54" dur="5.45">social media platforms doing the same</text>
  <text start="976.25" dur="5.23">thing they use algorithms Facebook</text>
  <text start="979.99" dur="6.51">Twitter</text>
  <text start="981.48" dur="8.47">Google and these algorithms banned</text>
  <text start="986.5" dur="6.06">certain individuals if these social</text>
  <text start="989.95" dur="4.77">media systems don&amp;#39;t like what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="992.56" dur="5.1">saying and we also know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="994.72" dur="5.85">algorithms to say you know this is fake</text>
  <text start="997.66" dur="5.79">news I mean it could be real news but</text>
  <text start="1000.57" dur="5.49">the fact checking systems they use well</text>
  <text start="1003.45" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s tied into the CIA Soros and</text>
  <text start="1006.06" dur="5.25">certain other individuals where they</text>
  <text start="1008.88" dur="6.18">control the narrative of the story and</text>

  <text start="1017.55" dur="5.28">and we can see there&amp;#39;s different levels</text>
  <text start="1020.1" dur="6.12">of the internet kill switch and we can</text>
  <text start="1022.83" dur="6.81">see that the social media platforms we</text>
  <text start="1026.22" dur="5.07">can see that the EU they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="1029.64" dur="3.87">about what people are going to say</text>
  <text start="1031.29" dur="5.789">they&amp;#39;re very worried about what is it</text>

  <text start="1062.55" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about losing</text>

  <text start="1069.39" dur="5.19">down and people are standing up I mean</text>
  <text start="1072.75" dur="5.64">just think about what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="1074.58" dur="6.33">the people are out there saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1078.39" dur="4.65">want these individuals running our</text>

  <text start="1101.37" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t want any of this now the system is</text>
  <text start="1104.28" dur="5.91">coming down because these globalist ran</text>
  <text start="1107.76" dur="4.68">it into the ground and they know this</text>
  <text start="1110.19" dur="4.85">and they&amp;#39;ve been in control for a very</text>
  <text start="1112.44" dur="5.68">long time they do not want to</text>
  <text start="1115.04" dur="6.69">give up control when a system is dying</text>
  <text start="1118.12" dur="7.54">they want to hold on to the control to</text>
  <text start="1121.73" dur="9.78">the end because they want to reshape</text>
  <text start="1125.66" dur="8.58">everything on the other side and we see</text>
  <text start="1131.51" dur="5.64">right now this is what&amp;#39;s happening that</text>
  <text start="1134.24" dur="6.63">people are speaking up they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1137.15" dur="6.87">to relinquish their control so they were</text>

  <text start="1144.02" dur="5.34">propaganda they&amp;#39;re censoring they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1147.23" dur="4.2">using an internet kill switch they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1149.36" dur="4.98">doing everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="1151.43" dur="5.19">shut people down this is what dictators</text>
  <text start="1154.34" dur="4.8">do now out in Malaysia the Malaysian</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="4.35">authorities they have deported the only</text>
  <text start="1159.14" dur="5.67">North Korean detained in the killing of</text>
  <text start="1160.97" dur="6.6">the half-brother of Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="1164.81" dur="5.76">they said well we really don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1167.57" dur="4.8">evidence against this North Korean so</text>
  <text start="1170.57" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re just going to have to release him</text>
  <text start="1172.37" dur="7.71">and send them back to North Korea and he</text>
  <text start="1175.46" dur="6.68">was held by the authorities but they</text>
  <text start="1180.08" dur="5.97">couldn&amp;#39;t find anything on him whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1182.14" dur="6.67">so there was nothing there at all we see</text>
  <text start="1186.05" dur="5.04">Kiev forces they have shot down an OSCE</text>
  <text start="1188.81" dur="5.76">drone over the Donetsk water filtration</text>
  <text start="1191.09" dur="5.04">system and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1194.57" dur="3.99">operational commander reported that the</text>
  <text start="1196.13" dur="5.49">Kiev side shot the drone intentionally</text>
  <text start="1198.56" dur="5.34">to prevent the OSCE from inspecting the</text>
  <text start="1201.62" dur="5.28">area and seeing what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="1203.9" dur="4.83">there now what is happening out in</text>
  <text start="1206.9" dur="4.56">Ukraine is that things are really</text>
  <text start="1208.73" dur="7.1">starting to heat up at this point the</text>
  <text start="1211.46" dur="8.73">Soros back groups in Ukraine they have</text>
  <text start="1215.83" dur="7.9">organized and blocked a coal shipment to</text>
  <text start="1220.19" dur="4.08">Kiev now this is not a small shutdown by</text>
  <text start="1223.73" dur="5.52">any means</text>
  <text start="1224.27" dur="8.07">this is 74,000 cargo cars of coal and</text>
  <text start="1229.25" dur="6.72">they have blocked them from leaving the</text>
  <text start="1232.34" dur="5.19">southeastern area going to Kiev now why</text>
  <text start="1235.97" dur="4.56">would he do this what would be the</text>
  <text start="1237.53" dur="6.57">purpose of doing this well to create an</text>
  <text start="1240.53" dur="6.54">incident to create a problem in the</text>
  <text start="1244.1" dur="4.77">region now of course they&amp;#39;re not out</text>
  <text start="1247.07" dur="3.81">there saying it&amp;#39;s Soros</text>
  <text start="1248.87" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re saying these are certain</text>
  <text start="1250.88" dur="5.659">individuals that are doing this but we</text>
  <text start="1253.49" dur="5.73">can see this is a provocation they want</text>
  <text start="1256.539" dur="4.841">poroshenko to do something it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1259.22" dur="4.01">hurting the southeastern people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1261.38" dur="4.02">going to be hurting the people in Kiev</text>
  <text start="1263.23" dur="5.85">so what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="1265.4" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re trying to push poroshenko into</text>
  <text start="1269.08" dur="5.86">escalating this war now in the United</text>
  <text start="1272.45" dur="5.459">States there is a House bill right now</text>
  <text start="1274.94" dur="5.729">that would slash us lethal military aid</text>
  <text start="1277.909" dur="5.041">to Ukraine by half right now and it</text>
  <text start="1280.669" dur="4.651">looks like that the United States is</text>
  <text start="1282.95" dur="4.41">kind of separating themselves from what</text>
  <text start="1285.32" dur="4.92">is going on in Ukraine and poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1287.36" dur="5.189">knew this was going to happen just like</text>
  <text start="1290.24" dur="5.1">Trump decided to stop the funding of the</text>
  <text start="1292.549" dur="4.711">moderate rebels in Syria he gave the</text>
  <text start="1295.34" dur="3.3">order of the CIA to stop the funding</text>
  <text start="1297.26" dur="3.33">there and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1298.64" dur="4.95">poroshenko at this point has no</text>
  <text start="1300.59" dur="5.309">alternative but to start a war and the</text>
  <text start="1303.59" dur="5.52">deep state the establishment they</text>
  <text start="1305.899" dur="4.921">realize they need to push poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1309.11" dur="3.929">into this and that we could see this is</text>
  <text start="1310.82" dur="4.469">why this is happening so this is a place</text>
  <text start="1313.039" dur="4.101">where we need to continually watch now</text>
  <text start="1315.289" dur="5.671">something very interesting just happen</text>
  <text start="1317.14" dur="5.889">Sweden they&amp;#39;ve imposed a military draft</text>
  <text start="1320.96" dur="3.51">now they&amp;#39;re citing that it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="1323.029" dur="4.14">Russia because of the threat of Russia</text>
  <text start="1324.47" dur="5.52">and they have abandoned the practice of</text>
  <text start="1327.169" dur="5.401">military conscription for men and for</text>
  <text start="1329.99" dur="4.679">seven years they haven&amp;#39;t drafted anyone</text>
  <text start="1332.57" dur="4.64">now they&amp;#39;re going to be drafting both</text>
  <text start="1334.669" dur="5.791">men and women they say their goal is</text>
  <text start="1337.21" dur="5.41">13,000 called-up per year with 4,000 of</text>
  <text start="1340.46" dur="3.99">them receiving training why because</text>
  <text start="1342.62" dur="4.189">Russian aggression and when you really</text>
  <text start="1344.45" dur="5.609">think about it how is 4,000 additional</text>
  <text start="1346.809" dur="5.831">trained troops going to make a huge</text>
  <text start="1350.059" dur="4.47">difference militarily particularly when</text>
  <text start="1352.64" dur="4.289">Sweden and Russia aren&amp;#39;t on particular</text>
  <text start="1354.529" dur="3.9">bad terms but it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
