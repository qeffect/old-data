  <text start="132.64" dur="6.9">Fed raises the rates Trump will come out</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="5.67">and contradict the Fed and he will</text>

  <text start="145.69" dur="4.769">raising rates we just heard from him</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="5.22">where he said that the economy boot will</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="4.171">be wrecked if the Fed continues raising</text>

  <text start="161.98" dur="5.099">a little bit before but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="5.55">target date the narrative shift is going</text>
  <text start="167.079" dur="5.071">to be completed around that period of</text>

  <text start="172.15" dur="4.41">apart because during this period of time</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="5.219">it&amp;#39;s the build-up it&amp;#39;s the build-up of</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="4.62">the narrative to get everyone used to</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="4.29">what Trump has been saying so he can go</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.1">back in time and say listen I said this</text>
  <text start="183.609" dur="3.811">it&amp;#39;s the Fed they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="2.58">causing the crash</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are making this</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="4.65">problem and the economy right now as</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve been watching we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the indicators it</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="5.58">is deteriorating very very quickly yes I</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="4.441">know on the outside the reports are that</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="3.18">everything is great actually if you look</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="4.32">at the mainstream media they continually</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="4.23">tell us how this is not a real economy</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="3.959">the economy isn&amp;#39;t as good as Trump is</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="5.4">saying things like that which we knew</text>
  <text start="210.459" dur="5.61">this was going to happen but his plan is</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="4.68">to show that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="216.069" dur="5.791">this way they can&amp;#39;t turn around and say</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="5.1">you know your economy that you were</text>
  <text start="221.86" dur="3.99">managing fell apart</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="3.96">he could say no the economy I was</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="4.74">managing has been doing very very well</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="5.339">show me where I lied now if they do do</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.25">this they&amp;#39;re gonna be pointing their</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="5.011">fingers at themselves and at Obama and</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="4.2">all the other presidents they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="4.44">about to do this because this would then</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="4.68">destroy everything that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="4.11">to do so they&amp;#39;re not gonna go and say</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="3.72">hey no these numbers we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.58" dur="3.15">manipulated because all he has to do is</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="2.579">go back and say oh wait you know you</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="4.229">know something you&amp;#39;re right if we go</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="4.891">back in time they&amp;#39;re all manipulated so</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="5.221">you&amp;#39;re telling me that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="7.02">working under manipulated data all this</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="6.33">time and this goes back to Obama the</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="5.85">Clintons the bushes all the way back</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="5.52">who&amp;#39;s responsible for this and then they</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="3.87">can start digging so the mainstream</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="3.63">media is gonna kind of stay away from</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="4.73">this but they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make the</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="5.34">point that the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="5.26">while Trump is showing all the same</text>
  <text start="280" dur="4.65">statistics that Obama showed that the</text>
  <text start="282.64" dur="4.11">economy is doing fantastic and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="4.639">pushing it to the limit here</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="6.06">he needs the economy to look fantastic</text>
  <text start="289.289" dur="7.331">now people who are living in this world</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="6.9">who you know are working who are trying</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="5.79">to make ends meet they know it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="5.37">tougher and tougher as time goes on they</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="4.8">understand that they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="4.23">getting raises those people who are</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="4.89">looking for jobs they they&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="4.68">those high-paying jobs those individuals</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="4.439">that are coming out of schools who are</text>

  <text start="325.93" dur="5.43">me to live on my own and pay for all</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="5.19">this debt and if you look at the humic</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="4.68">you can see this is dropping right now</text>
  <text start="333.82" dur="4.83">because people are seeing that the rates</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="5.7">are moving up home sales are starting to</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="6.27">decline auto spending outlooks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.46">sliding and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="344.92" dur="5.28">as time goes on now think about the</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="5.67">narrative right now as people are seeing</text>
  <text start="350.2" dur="5.46">this and they&amp;#39;re hearing the president</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="5.1">out there blaming this on the fed people</text>

  <text start="374.68" dur="6.57">wants everyone to understand and realize</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="7.2">and make the connection so when the</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="6.15">narrative shift happens they are ready</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="6.33">to point the finger at the central bank</text>

  <text start="400.06" dur="5.43">about to take a turn for the worse the</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="5.09">next generation of millennial graduates</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="6.48">could be trapped in a insurmountable</text>

  <text start="411.97" dur="3.93">federal student loan segment experienced</text>

  <text start="425.47" dur="3.72">go to school in a mock knock in college</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="4.02">or anything like that you get this</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="4.35">degree which is kind of worthless unless</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re specifically going for something</text>
  <text start="433.54" dur="4.86">where you&amp;#39;re going to be an accountant</text>

  <text start="468.57" dur="4.68">over time of course I mean this is kind</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="2.97">of common sense right now because</text>
  <text start="473.25" dur="3.87">instead of going out and paying for</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="4.05">retail instead of going out and</text>

  <text start="765.54" dur="4.83">pensions and we bring in even more</text>
  <text start="768.66" dur="3.179">problems because then you have those</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="3.51">people who are retiring who work their</text>
  <text start="771.839" dur="3.841">entire lives and all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="796.32" dur="6.45">your house for 15 20 25 years think</text>
  <text start="799.709" dur="5.941">about 2008 when all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="802.77" dur="5.31">housing prices dropped dramatically what</text>
  <text start="805.65" dur="3.84">do you do yes they were pumped up but</text>
  <text start="808.08" dur="3.449">this time is going to be completely</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="3.36">different they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="811.529" dur="3.361">create these bubbles because we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="814.89" dur="4.68">you will hold onto your house if you can</text>
  <text start="816.48" dur="4.77">and on the other side it will get better</text>
  <text start="819.57" dur="3.48">everything will get better on the other</text>
  <text start="821.25" dur="3.42">side don&amp;#39;t get me wrong but again we</text>
  <text start="823.05" dur="4.05">have to go through this middle part</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="3.69">which is the transition and many people</text>
  <text start="827.1" dur="2.97">are gonna have a very very difficult</text>
  <text start="828.36" dur="3.93">time and for those people have never</text>
  <text start="830.07" dur="3.93">been through it might even have a harder</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="3.87">time than those people who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="834" dur="3.899">through it already because those people</text>

  <text start="837.899" dur="5.611">know what to expect they know how to</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="4.41">weather the storm they&amp;#39;ve cut corners</text>
  <text start="843.51" dur="5.28">those people who have been living the</text>
  <text start="845.7" dur="5.85">same exact life they might not be able</text>
  <text start="848.79" dur="3.69">to handle it where maybe they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="3.95">out to dinner maybe</text>
  <text start="852.48" dur="5.549">they can&amp;#39;t you know pay for extra things</text>
  <text start="855.5" dur="4.12">they won&amp;#39;t know how to handle this and</text>
  <text start="858.029" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ll say why do I have to cut all of</text>
