  <text start="131.06" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t do this anymore we need to take</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="6.179">over the system and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="6.539">surprised that this is not that far into</text>
  <text start="139.489" dur="5.97">the future now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="142.549" dur="4.44">the US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="145.459" dur="4.831">will not let up and they will</text>
  <text start="146.989" dur="5.191">continually push the idea and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="170.93" dur="4.8">off people now what I found very</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="6.269">interesting in the wall street journal</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="7.74">is there was an article that said retail</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="7.5">earnings say less and less about the US</text>
  <text start="183.47" dur="10.07">economy well let&amp;#39;s think back for a</text>
  <text start="187.459" dur="9.03">second there was an article that said</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="4.84">manufacturing says less and less about</text>
  <text start="196.489" dur="4.5">the US economy because we&amp;#39;re a service</text>
  <text start="198.38" dur="5.28">economy well if we&amp;#39;re a service economy</text>
  <text start="200.989" dur="5.911">doesn&amp;#39;t that depend on retail and other</text>
  <text start="203.66" dur="5.22">type of services because as I know</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="4.41">consumer spending is about what seventy</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="6.329">percent of the economy but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="9.24">happening here is when these economic</text>
  <text start="215.209" dur="7.201">indicators report negative they need to</text>
  <text start="220.55" dur="3.39">show and this is coming from the US</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="4.41">government the corporate media that</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re not important retail is not</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="5.97">important in the US manufacturing is not</text>
  <text start="230.03" dur="7.56">important in the US when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="6.33">about the economy quality of jobs not</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="4.429">import all those people that fell off</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="5.67">the job market really not that important</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="7.451">so let&amp;#39;s think about this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="8.31">important then what&amp;#39;s important the</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="10.41">stock market the bubbles the student</text>

  <text start="396.94" dur="5.039">economy cannot survive like this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.919" dur="7.11">completely impossible now we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="9.11">another red flag and this is about temp</text>
  <text start="406.029" dur="8.73">help ahead of the last two recessions</text>
  <text start="411.089" dur="7.151">hiring by staff agencies rolled over</text>
  <text start="414.759" dur="6.601">well it just happened again so what</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="5.459">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that in the</text>
  <text start="421.36" dur="4.95">past going back a couple years to these</text>
  <text start="423.699" dur="5.51">temp jobs well they led the jobs</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="5.31">recovery since the Great Recession and</text>
  <text start="429.209" dur="8.441">now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="9.63">all over the last two times the temp</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="6.15">help sector slowed down everything</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="5.84">rolled over which means we went into</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="7.17">deep recessions the economy crashed</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="7.12">we&amp;#39;re going to see it once again this is</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="5.43">where we are headed and we see that the</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="4.29">bolted dry index is holding at 624 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="5.97">down one point but it&amp;#39;s not moving</text>
  <text start="458.5" dur="6.69">anywhere and trade with Japan well that</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="5.24">just continually collapses for seven</text>
  <text start="465.19" dur="5.789">months in a row exports of decline and</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="6.1">imports they&amp;#39;re declining for 16 months</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="5.431">this is the worst plunge that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="5.82">since 2009 and when when you look at the</text>
  <text start="476.41" dur="6.33">graph you can see that we are in a</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="5.34">downward trend we broke the barrier</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="4.35">where a negative territory right now and</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="6.269">the situation is getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="6.42">as time goes on now out in the EU we</text>
  <text start="491.139" dur="4.981">understand the banks are prepared and</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="5.49">getting ready for balance we know this</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="5.7">because documents were signed and all</text>
  <text start="499" dur="7.53">banks had to come into compliance now we</text>
  <text start="501.82" dur="6.779">understand out in the eurozone that the</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="3.24">eurozone is going to look at each bank</text>
  <text start="508.599" dur="5.401">and they&amp;#39;re going to go on a</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="7.05">case-by-case basis and the European</text>
  <text start="514" dur="5.01">Commission they adopted a new regulation</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="4.8">on Monday clarifying that there will be</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="4.86">no harmonized minimum level of bank</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="6.36">assets that can be wiped out by</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="6.48">regulators when a lender is down a move</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="6.15">that slightly softens requirements for</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="6.03">banks so this decision relieves the</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="4.709">banks from the possible obligation of</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="7.74">having to hold at least eight percent of</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="8.071">their liabilities and own funds so right</text>
  <text start="544.12" dur="5.13">now the pinks they don&amp;#39;t have to really</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="5.46">hold that much and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="5.31">bailed in when the eurozone looks at</text>
  <text start="552.37" dur="6.96">each bank and says okay we can save</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="7.5">these we can&amp;#39;t save those and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="4.83">we can do at this point so we can see it</text>
  <text start="562.06" dur="3.36">right now what they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="3.27">is they&amp;#39;re making it better</text>
  <text start="565.42" dur="3.83">and better for the banks to survive that</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="4.71">they don&amp;#39;t have to hold that much</text>
  <text start="569.25" dur="3.85">because they realize that eventually</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="3">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.1" dur="5.61">going to go inward and take the funds</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="5.3">from the people same things going to</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="4.59">happen here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="580.44" dur="5.62">this most likely will occur on a Friday</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.22">the declare bank holiday something will</text>
  <text start="586.06" dur="4.14">happen they&amp;#39;ll say there&amp;#39;s a cyberattack</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="4.99">there&amp;#39;ll be some type of malware and</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ll say don&amp;#39;t worry everyone this is</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="5.07">normal we&amp;#39;re prepared for this banks</text>
  <text start="595.21" dur="4.35">will reopen on Monday well they said</text>
  <text start="597.58" dur="6.99">this in Cyprus they said this in Greece</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="8.79">and it just didn&amp;#39;t happen and most</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="5.76">likely the scenario for this is that</text>
  <text start="608.35" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to say that the banks were</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="4.98">attacked somehow some way they need to</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="4.89">close down most likely on a Friday this</text>
  <text start="615.31" dur="5.19">is when they normally do it and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="3.72">say don&amp;#39;t worry about it on Monday we</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="3.69">will open the banks we need the weekend</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="4.68">to go through the systems to find out</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="7.65">what happened now of course what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="7.26">to happen is monday is going to come and</text>
  <text start="631.84" dur="3.83">like we saw in Cyprus and Greece they</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="4.89">didn&amp;#39;t open the banks they put limits on</text>
  <text start="635.67" dur="7.42">the banks how much people can take out</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="5.58">and we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen here</text>
  <text start="643.09" dur="3.51">and eventually what they do is they</text>
  <text start="644.5" dur="7.05">trade in your currency for worthless</text>
  <text start="646.6" dur="6.99">bank stock so this is a scenario a</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="6.12">situation they be they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="653.59" dur="5.88">for for a very long time and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.67" dur="3.63">getting ready to use it because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="6.8">no reason to prepare it unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.3" dur="8.22">going to use it now Russia and China</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="6.4">they have been doing everything to</text>
  <text start="669.52" dur="5.91">bypass the dollar completely and we see</text>
  <text start="672.67" dur="6.96">right now is the deep petro dollar</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="6.75">ization continues at the end of 2015</text>
  <text start="679.63" dur="6.03">china had become Russia&amp;#39;s biggest oil</text>
  <text start="682.18" dur="5.63">customer and as of April Russian oil</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="5.73">shipments to China hit a record high</text>
  <text start="687.81" dur="6.36">Russia has surpassed Saudi Arabia as the</text>
  <text start="691.39" dur="6.03">biggest crude exported to China and we</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="4.99">can see right now that Beijing has</text>
  <text start="697.42" dur="4.919">ramped up its imports of Russian oil</text>
  <text start="699.16" dur="6">by 52.4 percent last month compared to a</text>
  <text start="702.339" dur="6.75">year earlier and they&amp;#39;re doing all of</text>
  <text start="705.16" dur="6.21">this without the dollar and this is what</text>
  <text start="709.089" dur="5.821">the US is and the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="711.37" dur="5.61">most afraid of is that in the Middle</text>
  <text start="714.91" dur="7.26">Eastern countries all of these countries</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="8.399">they decide to use their own currency</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="6.029">they decide to use gold or silver to</text>
  <text start="725.379" dur="5.52">trade their natural resources by passing</text>
