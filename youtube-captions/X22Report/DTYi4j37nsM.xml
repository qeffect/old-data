  <text start="32.91" dur="5.01">today&amp;#39;s date is december 12 2013 and the</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="4.58">title this episode is the economy is</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="6.239">collapsing war is coming beware of</text>
  <text start="40.37" dur="5.77">wolves in sheep&amp;#39;s clothing and what we</text>
  <text start="44.159" dur="5.011">are seeing right now is that the central</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="6.12">bankers are going after as many natural</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="4.8">resources as they possibly can they are</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="4.619">making their move they&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="53.97" dur="5.43">Africa they&amp;#39;re trying to capture those</text>
  <text start="56.879" dur="5.61">nations Kenya the Central African</text>
  <text start="59.4" dur="5.64">nations Mally to capture the natural</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="4.441">resources to prop up the US dollar they</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="4.41">have lost control in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.799">they really wanted to get into Iran so</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re using a backdoor approach the</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="5.13">central bankers are making their move</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="6.06">trying to take over the bank of iran</text>
  <text start="76.859" dur="5.161">iran has been giving them a little bit</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="4.769">of control allowing them to control</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="4.11">interest rates and eventually the</text>
  <text start="84.359" dur="5.4">central bankers will be making their</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="6.989">move to put the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="6.42">currency so Iran will need to trade all</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="7.53">of their oil using the US dollar em</text>
  <text start="96.179" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;ll see how this plays out and if Iran</text>
  <text start="100.649" dur="4.01">will actually go along with this this</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="5.371">has nothing to do with nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="104.659" dur="6.52">or their nuclear program this only has</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="5.82">to do with how they are selling their</text>
  <text start="111.179" dur="4.86">natural resources and they want a</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="4.29">private western central bank in there</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="4.14">and right now President rouhani is</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.259">allowing them to do this the</text>
  <text start="120.179" dur="4.89">Revolutionary Guard right now is saying</text>
  <text start="122.609" dur="4.591">hey watch your step we see what the</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="5.22">Western powers are trying to do here now</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="5.369">is this a play is this something rohini</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="4.831">is just allowing them to do and then</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="7.411">he&amp;#39;s going to back out or has he been</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="5.88">bought off by the central bankers and if</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="4.05">this is the case</text>
  <text start="141" dur="6.21">talk about what&amp;#39;s going to happen Syria</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="6.21">on the other hand at this time is a</text>
  <text start="147.21" dur="5.37">complete mess they know they still need</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="5.13">to get into Syria they need to remove</text>
  <text start="152.58" dur="5.01">Assad they need to put in a puppet</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="4.71">regime and this is why Susan Rice John</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.19">Kerry the president has always said that</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="5.25">that they would they want Assad out of</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="6.78">the government and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="7.35">that right now is to move in with some</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="7.98">type of force and what do we know we</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="7.59">know that cNN has reported that Assad</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="4.32">has put away some chemical weapons to be</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="4.38">used at a later date that could be a</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="5.61">false flag event right now the US is</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="4.26">handling the disposal of the chemical</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="3.9">weapons and we could see some of those</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="5.67">chemical weapons you know happen to end</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="7.32">up in the United States and we can see</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="5.97">that the UN right now is moving forward</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="5.1">with allegations that Assad has</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="6.57">committed horrific war crimes just like</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="6.81">they did in Libya and Qaddafi was thrown</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="6.72">out using NATO forces to move into Syria</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="5.76">so the plans of the central bank have</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.74">been the same the way they approached it</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="5.24">might be a little different their</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="6.21">approach with Iran is a little different</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="5.26">right now because they realize the</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.24">American people will not go to war and</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="6.48">they have no interest in moving in and</text>
  <text start="230.03" dur="5.26">attacking any of these countries so they</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="4.98">are working out a different way of doing</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="5.729">it and we can see that the entire</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="4.979">mainstream media is out there playing</text>
  <text start="241.019" dur="5.611">this up like its nuclear nuclear nuclear</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="5.341">but behind the scenes the real action is</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="3.57">happening and this is why the president</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="3.21">has secret meetings this is why the</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="4.02">Congress has been left out in the dark</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="6.12">and they have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="6">because again they&amp;#39;re the the low man on</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="4.53">the totem pole they don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="4.44">central bankers are doing they really</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t understand what is actually going</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="5.189">on here and this is why they keep on</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.23">talking about sanctioned sanctioned</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="3.931">sanctions and this is why the Obama</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="2.4">administration was out there saying</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="3.39">listen</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.22">we put sanctions on them the only way to</text>
  <text start="277.17" dur="5.76">get into the country is to is a military</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="5.7">strike and to force our way in because</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="5.84">at this point they have no alternative</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s either they go in by force and</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="5.47">remove the government and put in a</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="5.91">puppet government or what they do right</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="5.82">now is they try this backhanded approach</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="5.61">and they try to get this going and prop</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="5.52">up the US dollar in this way do I think</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="5.85">this way is going to work eventually it</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="6.18">will not because the Revolutionary Guard</text>
  <text start="308.67" dur="4.82">the powers in Iran who&amp;#39;s been they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="4.5">been fighting against the Western powers</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="4.63">not to have a private western central</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="4.62">bank in there not to sell their oil</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.74">under the US dollar I don&amp;#39;t believe they</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="4.68">will eventually go through with this</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="5.97">deal and the only thing left then is</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="9.06">some type of false flag event to get</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="11.43">this whole thing to get the war started</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="9.53">to get everything in place for the major</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="6.51">collapse of the dollar that is coming</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="6.43">okay now let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="7.8">collapse news right now in the UK</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="6.6">housing prices rental prices are very</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="7.26">high the bubble is being blown up and</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="6.87">right now to counter this they are</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="5.52">converting shipping containers from</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="6.24">China to have people live in them it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="4.77">little tiny box and it seems like now</text>
  <text start="370.29" dur="4.71">like they&amp;#39;re saying well you know since</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="5.25">you you&amp;#39;re not making money enough money</text>
  <text start="375" dur="5.16">to afford all this expensive rentals and</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="6.27">housing you can live in a little box</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="6.33">right now and pay us you know 75 euros</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="7.55">per week and you can live in this type</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="7.68">of lifestyle and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="6.22">absolutely ridiculous there is no reason</text>
  <text start="394.17" dur="6.48">that anyone needs to live in a box this</text>
  <text start="397.41" dur="7.14">in UK there is a real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="6.69">brewing just like it is in the US and in</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="4.179">many other areas and eventually just</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="3.849">like we saw in two</text>
  <text start="408.729" dur="5.19">eight this is all going to come</text>
  <text start="411.189" dur="5.491">crumbling down the difference this time</text>
  <text start="413.919" dur="6.78">is that there are many many people</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="5.909">unemployed the UK population right now</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="4.83">is digging into their savings to make</text>
  <text start="422.589" dur="5.401">ends meet salaries have not been keeping</text>
  <text start="425.529" dur="4.32">up with the real estate bubble and with</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="4.889">inflation that has been happening with</text>
  <text start="429.849" dur="6.361">food and energy and this is the problem</text>
  <text start="432.879" dur="6.78">that we&amp;#39;re seeing and eventually this is</text>
  <text start="436.21" dur="6.15">going to implode and housing is going to</text>
  <text start="439.659" dur="6.72">collapse just like it and did in 2008</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="5.97">but it will be ten times worse now there</text>
  <text start="446.379" dur="5.581">is some type of confusion here because</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="5.369">unemployment last month I went down to</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="3.81">seven percent and they&amp;#39;re saying oh my</text>
  <text start="453.699" dur="4.411">God look at this unemployment so much</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="4.47">better but we know it was the the</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="4.35">holiday seasons coming up right now and</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="3.509">of course the numbers are manipulated</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="2.819">and we know they&amp;#39;re manipulating they</text>
  <text start="463.749" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t count the people who&amp;#39;ve fallen off</text>
  <text start="465.279" dur="6.45">and they change the calculation as of</text>
  <text start="468.069" dur="10.261">1994 and right now what is strange is</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="10.321">that the unemployment the people seeking</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="6.419">unemployment benefits rose 68,000 last</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="5.01">week and right now the Labor Department</text>
  <text start="484.749" dur="4.23">admits that it&amp;#39;s having difficulties</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="4.439">calculating it because of the seasonally</text>
  <text start="488.979" dur="4.98">adjusted people coming back to work and</text>
  <text start="491.499" dur="4.29">retail and things like that and normally</text>
  <text start="493.959" dur="3.69">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="495.789" dur="3.66">unemployment rate drops and it just draw</text>
  <text start="497.649" dur="3.781">from seven point three to seven percent</text>
  <text start="499.449" dur="4.08">they usually go back a month they</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="3.949">readjust everything and it usually comes</text>
  <text start="503.529" dur="4.801">out that there was a lot more people</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="5.111">applying for unemployment benefits than</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="3.389">was actually reported but normally what</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="2.849">they do is they don&amp;#39;t touch the</text>
  <text start="511.719" dur="4.411">unemployment rate they leave it at seven</text>
  <text start="513.339" dur="4.89">percent and no one really realizes</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="5.969">what&amp;#39;s going on and of course this is</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="5.97">all because it&amp;#39;s manipulated and this is</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="3.72">not the true unemployment if we look at</text>
  <text start="524.199" dur="3.271">the true unemployment it&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="525.819" dur="3.63">twenty-five to thirty percent depending</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="5.58">on whose calculation you go with and</text>
  <text start="529.449" dur="7.32">again come this December 28th Congress&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="7.139">now is discussing if they should extend</text>
  <text start="536.769" dur="5.641">the unemployment benefits after december</text>
  <text start="540.189" dur="5.13">twenty eighth and if they don&amp;#39;t a mill</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="4.89">plus people fall off and then means the</text>
  <text start="545.319" dur="3.81">unemployment rate is going to drop below</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="3.75">seven percent probably around the six</text>
  <text start="549.129" dur="6.121">point five percent which is right in</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="6.659">line with the fed&amp;#39;s tapering goal and we</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="5.25">can see how this is all playing out and</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="7.291">where we are moving here because they</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="7.379">have some type of event ready to go now</text>
  <text start="565" dur="5.519">that the good indicator is will they</text>
  <text start="567.879" dur="5.13">extend the unemployment benefits or not</text>
  <text start="570.519" dur="4.8">if they extend them that means they are</text>
  <text start="573.009" dur="4.531">not absolutely ready they need a little</text>
  <text start="575.319" dur="4.291">bit more time if they do not extend the</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="4.26">unemployment benefits they are ready to</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.89">go because then the number will hit the</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="5.01">feds goal they are ready to taper and we</text>
  <text start="584.5" dur="5.459">know what happens when they taper the</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="4.889">stock market is going to fall so if they</text>
  <text start="589.959" dur="4.11">tell everyone they are ready to taper</text>
  <text start="591.699" dur="4.95">the unemployment has come down we are</text>
  <text start="594.069" dur="6.75">definitely going to see an event we will</text>
  <text start="596.649" dur="6.12">see them start to taper or say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.819" dur="4.62">going to start the paper and then all of</text>
  <text start="602.769" dur="6.99">a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to have something</text>
  <text start="605.439" dur="5.851">happen now we understand that something</text>
  <text start="609.759" dur="5.341">is definitely going to happen because</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="9.09">all across the eurozone Italy the United</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="8.429">States Canada Australia UK Switzerland</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="7.62">they all have their bail in documents</text>
  <text start="623.529" dur="6.36">and their procedures ready to go Italy</text>
  <text start="628" dur="4.62">backs an eight percent minimum bail in</text>
  <text start="629.889" dur="5.041">for aling banks the public intervention</text>
  <text start="632.62" dur="4.05">on trouble banks should come after</text>
  <text start="634.93" dur="3.899">inflicting losses on bond holders</text>
  <text start="636.67" dur="4.26">through a minimum bail in of a percent</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="3.93">of total bank liabilities the</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="3.93">introduction of bailing clauses may</text>
  <text start="642.759" dur="4.68">spread risk across the eurozone bank</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="6.149">sector and right now the European Union</text>
  <text start="647.439" dur="6.361">agrees to rules for bank balance and</text>
  <text start="651.009" dur="5.221">what they&amp;#39;re saying is we are not going</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="3.57">to go hit the taxpayer what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="4.829">to do is we&amp;#39;re going to hit the</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="7.409">depositors the creditors the bondholders</text>
  <text start="661.059" dur="7.47">of the banks and we will do balance just</text>
  <text start="664.779" dur="6.151">like the United States Bank of England</text>
  <text start="668.529" dur="4.8">dot the FDIC Bank of England document</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="4.8">that spells out how to do the ballon</text>
  <text start="673.329" dur="2.921">that has been used as the template for</text>
  <text start="675.73" dur="2.59">every</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="5.79">lowcountry out there including the</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="6.3">eurozone and what this goes on to say is</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="5.1">that the EU nations agreed new rules for</text>
  <text start="684.62" dur="4.92">bank bailouts or bail-ins to save</text>
  <text start="687.14" dur="5.28">taxpayers from paying for the rescue of</text>
  <text start="689.54" dur="5.82">ailing financial institutions they will</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="4.56">now use bail-ins all countries now</text>

  <text start="887.88" dur="5.97">they are creating money which is really</text>
  <text start="890.579" dur="4.981">not the US government it is the Fed the</text>

  <text start="2015.99" dur="5.819">there are different scenarios that could</text>
  <text start="2018.179" dur="6.63">happen here the u.s. central bankers</text>
  <text start="2021.809" dur="4.441">take control over ran they replace the</text>
  <text start="2024.809" dur="3.571">central bank there with the private</text>
  <text start="2026.25" dur="3.63">western central bank and they start</text>
  <text start="2028.38" dur="4.32">using the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="2029.88" dur="5.16">currency and everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="2032.7" dur="5.19">everything goes on and the only problem</text>
  <text start="2035.04" dur="5.85">now is Syria where they need to create</text>
  <text start="2037.89" dur="6.029">some type of false flag event to enable</text>
  <text start="2040.89" dur="5.4">the us or NATO forces to go in and</text>
  <text start="2043.919" dur="4.47">strike Syria because right now we have a</text>
  <text start="2046.29" dur="5.849">couple things happening in Syria we have</text>
  <text start="2048.389" dur="6.121">them reporting that Assad has a cache of</text>
  <text start="2052.139" dur="4.381">chemical weapons we understand that the</text>
  <text start="2054.51" dur="4.409">u.s. is disposing the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="2056.52" dur="5.01">out at sea on a u.s. ship we also</text>
  <text start="2058.919" dur="4.98">understand that the UN is bringing up</text>
  <text start="2061.53" dur="4.8">bringing Assad up on charges for war</text>
  <text start="2063.899" dur="6.421">crimes which will allow NATO forces to</text>
  <text start="2066.33" dur="6.599">go in and remove Assad so that is still</text>
  <text start="2070.32" dur="4.5">being played out at the same time we the</text>
  <text start="2072.929" dur="4.321">u.s. also has the problem with China</text>
  <text start="2074.82" dur="4.98">becoming the next reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="2077.25" dur="4.23">they will not let that happen so do I</text>
  <text start="2079.8" dur="3.72">think everything will go smoothly and</text>
  <text start="2081.48" dur="5.669">perfectly with Iran with no glitches</text>
  <text start="2083.52" dur="6.54">bumps or potholes in the road absolutely</text>
  <text start="2087.149" dur="4.77">not so what we&amp;#39;re already hearing from</text>
  <text start="2090.06" dur="4.44">the Revolutionary Guard is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2091.919" dur="4.23">catching wind of this now if rohini is</text>
  <text start="2094.5" dur="3.96">in the back pocket of the central</text>
  <text start="2096.149" dur="6.081">bankers we might see some type of</text>
  <text start="2098.46" dur="6.06">revolution or overthrow of rohini and</text>
  <text start="2102.23" dur="5.26">remove him from office and if that</text>
  <text start="2104.52" dur="5.01">happens the US will have one alternative</text>
  <text start="2107.49" dur="4.379">and that all that alternative would be</text>
  <text start="2109.53" dur="3.72">to go in and strike Iran and put them</text>
  <text start="2111.869" dur="4.221">back on the US dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="2113.25" dur="7.28">currency and we can see a false flag</text>
  <text start="2116.09" dur="8.38">combined with the Syrian false flag and</text>
  <text start="2120.53" dur="6.01">you know or the Iran doesn&amp;#39;t go along</text>
  <text start="2124.47" dur="4.32">with the full deal the US central</text>
  <text start="2126.54" dur="4.29">bankers prepare some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="2128.79" dur="4.41">rohini catches wind of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2130.83" dur="4.38">actually trying to do and they stop them</text>
  <text start="2133.2" dur="3.99">from putting the US dollar in as a</text>
  <text start="2135.21" dur="4.08">reserve currency and they stop the</text>
  <text start="2137.19" dur="3.73">central bankers from even moving forward</text>
  <text start="2139.29" dur="4.06">into the country</text>
  <text start="2140.92" dur="4.71">and that whole thing will go down the</text>
  <text start="2143.35" dur="3.96">drain then we&amp;#39;ll have a false flag event</text>
  <text start="2145.63" dur="3.93">here and then everything will move in</text>
  <text start="2147.31" dur="4.5">they are definitely going to do some</text>
  <text start="2149.56" dur="5.04">type of false flag event how big it will</text>
  <text start="2151.81" dur="4.68">be it all depends on Iran right now and</text>
  <text start="2154.6" dur="4.14">we have to remember this is not a</text>
  <text start="2156.49" dur="4.62">perfect science where oh look if they do</text>
  <text start="2158.74" dur="5.07">this we do this they are trying all</text>
  <text start="2161.11" dur="5.97">different tactics to reach their goal</text>
  <text start="2163.81" dur="5.31">and if tactics change just like we saw</text>
  <text start="2167.08" dur="4.44">the Syrian event where everyone thought</text>
  <text start="2169.12" dur="5.28">we were going in to strike but all of a</text>
  <text start="2171.52" dur="5.49">sudden a deal was made because everyone</text>
  <text start="2174.4" dur="4.29">was realizing that nobody was for a war</text>
  <text start="2177.01" dur="4.08">and they needed a way out of the</text>
  <text start="2178.69" dur="4.83">situation here they&amp;#39;re trying a backdoor</text>
  <text start="2181.09" dur="5.49">approach but Syria is a whole nother</text>
  <text start="2183.52" dur="5.7">problem and we can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="2186.58" dur="4.59">formulating and building up and they are</text>
  <text start="2189.22" dur="5.49">definitely preparing some type of an</text>
  <text start="2191.17" dur="6.42">event some event will occur what it will</text>
  <text start="2194.71" dur="5.19">be it could be a cyber attack it could</text>
  <text start="2197.59" dur="5.28">be a chemical weapon attack and it could</text>
  <text start="2199.9" dur="6.57">be a dirty bomb type of nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="2202.87" dur="7.02">this is still in play right now and</text>
  <text start="2206.47" dur="8.73">right now in Syria the Western powers</text>
  <text start="2209.89" dur="8.73">are completely losing control there what</text>
  <text start="2215.2" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re saying is they the situation on</text>
  <text start="2218.62" dur="5.13">the ground has become so complicated</text>
  <text start="2220.99" dur="5.52">that the Western powers are more worried</text>
  <text start="2223.75" dur="4.74">there are so many factions and militant</text>
  <text start="2226.51" dur="4.53">groups that the silver war has become</text>
  <text start="2228.49" dur="6.57">impossible to control or keep track of</text>
  <text start="2231.04" dur="6.45">of what is going on inside Syria and you</text>

  <text start="2237.49" dur="5.79">know who&amp;#39;s in control of anything and</text>
  <text start="2239.41" dur="7.14">this is a perfect setup for some type of</text>
  <text start="2243.28" dur="4.98">an event and we know that we have many</text>
  <text start="2246.55" dur="3.42">things happening here we have the dollar</text>
