  <text start="43.29" dur="4.86">control pretty much everything they</text>
  <text start="46.199" dur="3.811">along with the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="48.15" dur="3.99">control the creation of money even</text>
  <text start="50.01" dur="4.229">though the Federal Reserve is not part</text>
  <text start="52.14" dur="4.83">of the government but they do control</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="4.74">right now the creation of money the</text>

  <text start="58.979" dur="6">corporate media says they tell them what</text>
  <text start="61.08" dur="6.06">to say and that is what they always had</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.831">up into the point where the internet</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="4.399">really went mainstream and when the</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.589">internet went mainstream all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="71.539" dur="4.9">alternative media had an outlet where</text>

  <text start="76.439" dur="6.24">and things going on around the world and</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="6.93">the government did not like this this</text>
  <text start="82.679" dur="7.591">was a huge problem and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="6.03">trying to do is find a way to control</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="4.62">the alternative media because the</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.919">alternative media reports on the things</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="5.689">they don&amp;#39;t want reported on and Dianne</text>

  <text start="130.83" dur="4.65">organizations now of course they want to</text>
  <text start="133.319" dur="5.67">do this because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="5.01">control what the American people see and</text>
  <text start="138.989" dur="3.661">hear</text>

  <text start="192.12" dur="4.47">rounds all in the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="194.13" dur="6.92">what we&amp;#39;re finding out is that these</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="7.29">girls aren&amp;#39;t even from Nigeria three of</text>

  <text start="228.74" dur="7.12">misrepresentation and but they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="6.27">this as the campaign and we can see here</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="3.51">the alternative media is pointing this</text>

  <text start="244.62" dur="3.87">this on in my other reports we</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.28">understand why they&amp;#39;re doing this all of</text>
  <text start="248.49" dur="6.24">a sudden in this one area and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="6.239">kidnappings going on all over the place</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="6">and it&amp;#39;s a lot more than 100 to 200</text>
  <text start="258.359" dur="5.311">girls it&amp;#39;s happening in almost every</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="5.34">single country around the world and of</text>
  <text start="263.67" dur="4.65">course they&amp;#39;re pointing out this one</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="5.28">particular country because this is the</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="6.12">country they want to get US troops into</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="5.1">and this is why this story is really</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="4.29">flaring up and the US government the</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="5.7">Department of Justice is not going to do</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="5.7">much down in this area except say we</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="4.74">need to close the embassies travel</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.13">advisory fighting starting to break out</text>
  <text start="286.89" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re going to push AFRICOM into this</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="4.74">area to try to take control and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="3.24">doing this because China is there</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="3.42">pumping in millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="3.39">dollars into this area to build up the</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="3.87">infrastructure they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="4.71">natural resources and wherever China is</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="4.35">in central Africa that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="7.17">United States is but just to point out</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="7.88">that this is a problem with them pushing</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="5.34">the agenda and now they&amp;#39;re doing it with</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="7.2">information that is not true at this</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="7.8">time now in Venezuela we understand that</text>
  <text start="321.02" dur="4.9">there are a lot of protests and the</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="4.08">United States government would like to</text>
  <text start="325.92" dur="4.62">remove the government officials in</text>
  <text start="328.32" dur="5.1">Venezuela Venezuela has a lot of oil</text>
  <text start="330.54" dur="4.56">they would love to take that oil set up</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="4.98">a private western central bank in that</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="5.55">country and put this oil using on on the</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="4.769">US dollar as the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="5.79">right now they&amp;#39;re putting sanctions on</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="5.821">certain individuals in Venezuela and</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="4.71">Maduro dismissed the sanctions saying US</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="4.38">lawmakers were fools for passing these</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.01">measures the US government wants to</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="5.94">sanction us with some stupid measure</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="6.19">Maduro retorted and again they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.89">this in every single country that has</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="5.43">natural resources where they feel they</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="5.46">can get into these countries prop them</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.58">up put the US dollar in as the reserve</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="4.83">currency take over the country put them</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="4.59">into debt and steal all of their natural</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="4.86">resources and the people end up paying</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="5.16">for it the people go into debt there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.35" dur="4.95">austerity people find no work and the</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="4.05">situation just gets worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="3.63">worse look at Greece look at Cyprus look</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="4.4">at France look at Spain look at Italy</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.46">now look at Ukraine it is the same</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="6.76">everywhere so what they&amp;#39;re doing really</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="7.38">doesn&amp;#39;t work now in Ukraine what we are</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="6.24">seeing is that the Ukrainian puppet</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.79">regime is trying to cut off the water</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="4.729">supply to Crimea they&amp;#39;re building some</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="3.499">dams right now</text>
  <text start="408.289" dur="3.87">and there&amp;#39;s satellite images showing</text>
  <text start="410.059" dur="5.81">that they&amp;#39;re putting sandbags trying to</text>
  <text start="412.159" dur="7.141">cut off the water supply and right now</text>
  <text start="415.869" dur="5.5">the Crimean government is trying to</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="5.039">figure out how they can get fresh water</text>
  <text start="421.369" dur="4.741">into their area and they&amp;#39;re considering</text>
  <text start="424.339" dur="3.66">an option of drawing water supply from</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="4.739">the cubano river and channeling it</text>
  <text start="427.999" dur="5.551">through the Strait of kerch and we I</text>
  <text start="430.849" dur="4.44">reported this quite a while ago and I</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="4.109">see that this is moving forward now the</text>
  <text start="435.289" dur="5.46">dam is being built waters being blocked</text>
  <text start="437.659" dur="4.771">off and again the United States the</text>
  <text start="440.749" dur="3.57">central bankers the puppet government in</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="8.459">Ukraine is going to do everything they</text>
  <text start="444.319" dur="9.421">possibly can to pretty much try to push</text>
  <text start="450.889" dur="5.28">their agenda forward as best they</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="4.349">possibly can by using violence by</text>
  <text start="456.169" dur="4.11">cutting off water by not paying their</text>
  <text start="458.089" dur="3.841">gas bill they&amp;#39;re doing everything they</text>
  <text start="460.279" dur="4.32">possibly can they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="6.599">provoke provoke and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.599" dur="6.451">continuing with this agenda now</text>
  <text start="468.529" dur="5.61">Ukrainian armed forces are pulling back</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="4.619">from the Mara pole center Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="4.56">National Guard units have pulled back</text>
  <text start="475.669" dur="4.23">from the flashpoint and what&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="478.699" dur="3.3">about this they&amp;#39;re reporting that</text>
  <text start="479.899" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re pulling back but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.999" dur="5.52">actually not really pulling back they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.55" dur="5">being pushed into another area and this</text>
  <text start="487.519" dur="4.531">is where they&amp;#39;re having the referendum</text>
  <text start="489.55" dur="4.53">Ukrainian security forces are pulling in</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="4.829">combat equipment into a little ganske</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="4.629">and this goes on to say that Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="496.879" dur="4.68">Hawks are pulling in military hardware</text>
  <text start="498.709" dur="6.68">to Lugansk on the eve of the referendum</text>
  <text start="501.559" dur="7.41">on the status of the lugansk region</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="4.96">about 30 infantry combat vehicles and 10</text>
  <text start="508.969" dur="3.63">armored personnel carriers are</text>
  <text start="510.349" dur="5.22">approaching the city forces are being</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="5.1">pulled in from all over the country so</text>
  <text start="515.569" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re really not saying over let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.699" dur="4.291">pull back at a mere poll what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.439" dur="7.231">doing is they&amp;#39;re just maneuvering their</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="6.269">tanks there APC units the soldiers to a</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.529">different location of where the</text>
  <text start="528.259" dur="5.01">referendum is going to be held now it</text>
  <text start="531.199" dur="3.901">looks like the donetsk referendum is</text>
  <text start="533.269" dur="3.93">starting ahead of schedule the</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="4.5">referendum on the status of the declared</text>
  <text start="537.199" dur="4.33">own ends People&amp;#39;s Republic scheduled for</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="3.94">the 11th of May has begun</text>
  <text start="541.529" dur="5.1">ahead of schedule in two districts due</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="5.52">to an aggravated situation and they have</text>
  <text start="546.629" dur="5.491">about 1,500 polling stations ready to go</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="5.85">and they are ready to move this forward</text>
  <text start="552.12" dur="5.49">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is Ukraine</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="5.159">is claiming right now that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="5.279">detained terrorists with a hundred</text>
  <text start="560.069" dur="6.301">pre-marked referendum balint ballots and</text>
  <text start="562.889" dur="6.541">they&amp;#39;re saying that they captured these</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="6.389">people they were heavily armed they had</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="5.61">a hundred thousand pre-marked positive</text>
  <text start="572.759" dur="4.38">referendum ballots so we know the</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="4.38">election is fixed they showed these</text>
  <text start="577.139" dur="4.44">people on the ground with plastic bags</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="5.099">on their heads now they said they were</text>
  <text start="581.579" dur="5.19">heavily armed they had these ballots</text>
  <text start="584.519" dur="4.8">they were terrorists but there was not</text>
  <text start="586.769" dur="5.31">one gunshot and they just capture him</text>
  <text start="589.319" dur="4.051">captured them all put them on the ground</text>
  <text start="592.079" dur="5.51">and they showed a picture of two of them</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="6.75">so this looks like a you know fake phony</text>
  <text start="597.589" dur="5.74">they were trying to use this to show</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="6.569">that oh look this referendum isn&amp;#39;t real</text>
  <text start="603.329" dur="6.841">and the whole story really does not make</text>
  <text start="606.689" dur="4.71">sense whatsoever now during this to the</text>

  <text start="628.139" dur="4.05">having the referendum at this point so</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="4.74">you can see they are going to push this</text>
  <text start="632.189" dur="5.311">agenda forward they are going to use</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="5.639">violence when I say they it&amp;#39;s the let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="662.79" dur="3.12">oversee the election and now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="664.649" dur="3.63">know if it&amp;#39;s because of all the violence</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s going on there but something</text>
  <text start="668.279" dur="4.98">there is some reason why people haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="671.37" dur="3.46">wanted to come in but there&amp;#39;s about 400</text>
  <text start="673.259" dur="3.371">and something</text>
  <text start="674.83" dur="4.11">side reporters from all over the place</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="5.43">that are overseeing the elections uh</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s going to happen tomorrow now the</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="6.39">USS Taylor that is in the Black Sea</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="8.37">right now is being docked at the port in</text>
  <text start="688.45" dur="8.73">Georgia and this is to reform the</text>
  <text start="693.16" dur="7.79">commitment to NATO and they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="6.83">the ship there at this point okay now</text>
  <text start="700.95" dur="5.59">Congress got together this week the</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="6.06">congressional members on Capitol Hill</text>
  <text start="706.54" dur="6.57">got together and they were discussing</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="4.96">electromagnetic pulse EMP attack on our</text>
  <text start="713.11" dur="4.62">national power good and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="5.61">it would be so devastating that it would</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="7.53">knock out pretty much everything at this</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="6.51">point and we would be in a revolution</text>
  <text start="725.26" dur="4.02">type of state like the TV show and</text>
  <text start="727.15" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re saying that a nuclear strike</text>
  <text start="729.28" dur="5.61">would pale in comparison to this and</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="4.65">they went on to say that such an event</text>
  <text start="734.89" dur="4.92">could originate from our Sun as a</text>
  <text start="737.29" dur="5.25">powerful solar discharge or in the form</text>
  <text start="739.81" dur="7.32">of what experts call a super EMP bomb</text>
  <text start="742.54" dur="6.87">now if this bomb was exploded over the</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="4.56">center part of the country it would</text>
  <text start="749.41" dur="5.7">reach from coast to coast and knock out</text>
  <text start="751.69" dur="5.25">our electronics are transformers and we</text>
  <text start="755.11" dur="4.56">understand that to replace these</text>
  <text start="756.94" dur="5.13">transformers it would take weeks upon</text>
  <text start="759.67" dur="4.14">weeks to get new ones here because we</text>
  <text start="762.07" dur="2.91">just don&amp;#39;t have them on hand where we</text>
  <text start="763.81" dur="7.68">can just replace them and a lot of</text>
  <text start="764.98" dur="9.03">lectronimo all devices would cease to</text>
  <text start="771.49" dur="4.98">function at this time but according to</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="4.83">the experts and the congressional</text>
  <text start="776.47" dur="4.59">members who have been made aware of this</text>
  <text start="778.84" dur="5.76">threat this is going to happen at some</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="6.36">point in our future now they didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="784.6" dur="5.19">that it might happen or it&amp;#39;s a high</text>
  <text start="787.42" dur="4.65">probability they&amp;#39;re saying this is going</text>
  <text start="789.79" dur="4.59">to happen at some point in our future</text>
  <text start="792.07" dur="5.64">and their only question is their only</text>
  <text start="794.38" dur="7.53">question is whether it comes from a</text>
  <text start="797.71" dur="6.75">natural disaster or a man-made attack so</text>
  <text start="801.91" dur="5.4">are we going to get hit by a solar flare</text>
  <text start="804.46" dur="4">and they&amp;#39;re saying from now until a year</text>
  <text start="807.31" dur="4.09">right now we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="808.46" dur="4.56">height of getting there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="811.4" dur="4.11">possibility that we could get hit from a</text>
  <text start="813.02" dur="4.14">solar flare or are we going to get hit</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="3.81">by some type of nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="817.16" dur="5.1">high-altitude nuclear weapon being</text>
  <text start="819.32" dur="5.76">launched by Russia China North Korea</text>
  <text start="822.26" dur="5.04">Iran Syria you know any country they</text>
  <text start="825.08" dur="3.81">want to pick but I don&amp;#39;t think Surya has</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="3.72">nuclear weapons so we don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="828.89" dur="3.57">that but what they&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="4.17">those countries that they want to get</text>
  <text start="832.46" dur="4.77">into war with that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="835.19" dur="4.29">for this framework and we also have to</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="4.89">remember Janet Napolitano told us that</text>
  <text start="839.48" dur="4.62">not if but when the grid system goes out</text>
  <text start="842.12" dur="5.1">and we have to remember they had a dry</text>
  <text start="844.1" dur="6.84">run out in California they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="847.22" dur="6.81">practicing with drills we had the 2003</text>
  <text start="850.94" dur="5.28">East Coast blackout which I do believe</text>
  <text start="854.03" dur="4.35">was some type of test to see if they</text>
  <text start="856.22" dur="4.29">could do it because they plan this way</text>
  <text start="858.38" dur="3.72">way in advance this is nothing new that</text>
  <text start="860.51" dur="3.3">they just come up with they know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="4.62">going to be doing this type of stuff and</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re going to use it later on and we</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="5.66">can see that this would it be a complete</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="7.38">disaster we understand the economy is</text>
  <text start="872.38" dur="6.79">collapsing the dollar is losing the</text>
  <text start="876.68" dur="4.92">reserve status around the world we have</text>
  <text start="879.17" dur="4.92">many flashpoints in different regions of</text>
  <text start="881.6" dur="4.02">the world and we understand the only way</text>
  <text start="884.09" dur="3.57">out of this for the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="885.62" dur="3.99">United States government is to start a</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="4.35">war and we can see they are actually</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="3.87">doing this all over the world now they</text>
  <text start="892.01" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t want to they don&amp;#39;t want it to look</text>
  <text start="893.48" dur="4.83">like it&amp;#39;s coming from them it can&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="896.33" dur="3.99">like the central bankers the United</text>
  <text start="898.31" dur="4.14">States government started the war it has</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="4.25">to look like another country did it but</text>
  <text start="902.45" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ll provoke them provoke provoke</text>
  <text start="904.57" dur="5.02">until something happens and if nothing</text>
  <text start="906.83" dur="4.26">happens they will use false flag events</text>
  <text start="909.59" dur="3.15">and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing what we see that</text>
  <text start="911.09" dur="3.69">the City Council building we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="4.23">with the voter ballots where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="914.78" dur="7.2">saying that they caught these falsified</text>
  <text start="916.97" dur="7.08">ballots that were checked for check two</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="4.41">yes that we want to secede from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="3.78">and they captured all these people so we</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="4.29">can see that they&amp;#39;ve been using these</text>
  <text start="927.83" dur="5.31">mini false false type of flags turkey</text>
  <text start="930.68" dur="6.21">used a false flag they were secretly</text>
  <text start="933.14" dur="5.43">having military personnel sneak into</text>
  <text start="936.89" dur="3.6">Syria they were going to launch a</text>
  <text start="938.57" dur="3.51">missile attack back into Turkey to make</text>
  <text start="940.49" dur="4.2">it look like Syria was</text>
  <text start="942.08" dur="4.89">attacking them so we can see how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.69" dur="5.67">continually doing this this is non-stop</text>
  <text start="946.97" dur="5.76">and eventually their backs will be</text>
  <text start="950.36" dur="4.23">against the wall and this is why they</text>
  <text start="952.73" dur="3.84">are coming out and saying this at this</text>
  <text start="954.59" dur="5.64">point this is why they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="956.57" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s not if it&amp;#39;s just a matter of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="960.23" dur="2.79">going to happen is it going to be</text>
  <text start="961.49" dur="3.72">natural or they going to make it look</text>
  <text start="963.02" dur="4.23">like it&amp;#39;s natural or are they going to</text>
  <text start="965.21" dur="4.11">actually make it look like it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="967.25" dur="4.86">from a country where we need to get into</text>
  <text start="969.32" dur="5.67">war and they know something&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="972.11" dur="6.14">they understand this the power I do</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="5.79">believe is going to go out at some point</text>
  <text start="978.25" dur="4.9">this is why we see the government</text>
  <text start="980.78" dur="5.25">officials talking about it this is why</text>
  <text start="983.15" dur="5.28">we see Janet Napolitano discussing it</text>
  <text start="986.03" dur="5.37">and telling us not if but when they are</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="6.09">continually bombarding us with this</text>
  <text start="991.4" dur="5.85">information because they want everyone</text>
  <text start="994.52" dur="5.46">to understand what is coming they like</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="5.16">to give us little bread crumbs they like</text>
  <text start="999.98" dur="5.01">to feed it to us a little bit they want</text>
  <text start="1002.41" dur="4.5">us to understand it will be coming from</text>
  <text start="1004.99" dur="4.46">one of these countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
