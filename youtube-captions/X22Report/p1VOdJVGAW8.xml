  <text start="86.22" dur="6.439">wanted to start off by going back to</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="6.4">1913 and even a little bit before this</text>
  <text start="92.659" dur="7.061">because we know that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="6.96">is the third central bank system there</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="5.189">was the first central bank then we had</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="4.17">the second central bank and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="3.96">Andrew Jackson got rid of the second</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.98">central bank and remember Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="6.091">is hanging in the Oval Office right next</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="6.15">to Trump&amp;#39;s desk and here we are with the</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="4.83">Federal Reserve and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="117.72" dur="4.71">saying that the 16th amendment was never</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="4.11">ratified that this Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="122.43" dur="4.28">should not even exist</text>
  <text start="123.9" dur="6.77">but we know what the central bank does</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="9.339">we know that it corrupts a system and</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="9.3">the founding fathers rejected a private</text>
  <text start="136.049" dur="9.091">western central bank system now the term</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="9.579">fiat in latin roughly translates to</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="5.879">there shall be when we refer to fiat</text>
  <text start="149.549" dur="3.841">money we are referring to money that</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="8.071">exists because the government declares</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="8.42">it into existence or the private western</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="6.229">central bank declares it into</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="6.12">existence it is not based on production</text>
  <text start="165.319" dur="7.041">or earnings not backed by any commodity</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="7.65">it is solely based on trust that is it</text>
  <text start="172.36" dur="5.95">fiat money is exchanging the economy as</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="5.25">long as there is faith in the government</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="5.009">that issues it or the central bank that</text>
  <text start="180.83" dur="5.7">issues it and history has shown that</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="5.611">fiat money or faith-based currency it</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="4.2">always fails now remember the Private</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="5.73">wasn&amp;#39;t central bank just doesn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="190.73" dur="7.38">the currency it creates it with interest</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="6.06">attached this is why our founding</text>
  <text start="198.11" dur="4.83">fathers considered but decidedly</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="4.849">rejected the creation of a national</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="6.84">central bank they understood that</text>
  <text start="205.569" dur="7.181">government even the best they could not</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="6.51">control spending they could not control</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="8.459">it that it would end up being corrupt</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="7.25">and every dollar that is created makes</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="7.021">and I shouldn&amp;#39;t even say dollar every</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="7.21">debt note that is created it makes the</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="6.74">other debt notes in your pocket worth</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="7.41">less and less eventually any currency</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="6.609">that is backed by a private western</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="5.579">central bank with interest attached it</text>
  <text start="241.579" dur="5.16">will wipe out the savings of the</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="5.28">citizens who put faith in that currency</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="5.37">and this is what we see happening today</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="5.881">if you really think about it think about</text>
  <text start="252.109" dur="4.141">what is happening around the world think</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="5.73">about those people that have their</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="6.69">currency in the banking system what</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="4.92">interest are they receiving on it well</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re not because throughout Europe we</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="2.91">know they have negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="5.43">here in the United States the interest</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="7.17">rates are very very low why did they</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="6.99">have to do this because the debt blew up</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="5.67">and governments they couldn&amp;#39;t sustain</text>
  <text start="279.35" dur="3.84">the debt with the amount of tax receipts</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.08">coming in because if the interest rates</text>
  <text start="283.19" dur="5.4">were allowed to to increase the way they</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="6.51">would normally without the central bank</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="6.44">controlling it no government would be</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="7.32">able to pay off the interest on</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="6.37">why because as we add on more debt as</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="6.18">the Fiat system the central bank system</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="7.8">breaks down jobs are lost</text>
  <text start="305.39" dur="6.42">there&amp;#39;s austerity because there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="5.13">debt the government has to cut corners</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="5.34">they have to put into place regulations</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="6.87">they have to do what the central bank</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="7.5">tells them to do now when we go back in</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="6.18">time the founding fathers they hated</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.28">paper money this is why when they</text>
  <text start="327.38" dur="4.71">created the Constitution they didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="4.74">hey let&amp;#39;s put up a private western</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="5.04">central bank let another entity create</text>
  <text start="334.67" dur="5.13">our currency let them manage it all and</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="4.17">make sure they put interest attached to</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.08">this currency that they&amp;#39;re creating and</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="7.26">let them loan it to the government no</text>
  <text start="343.88" dur="11.37">they said the people will coin their own</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="9.69">currency and there is no interest they</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="7.08">did this on purpose now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="7.32">time James Madison wrote paper money is</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="5.79">unjust it is unconstitutional for it</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="6.87">affects the rights of property as much</text>
  <text start="368.12" dur="6.12">as taking away equal value inland George</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="5.79">Washington wrote to Thomas Jefferson on</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="6.48">August 1st 1786 paper money has had the</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="5.73">effect in your state that what that it</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="5.91">will ever have to ruin commerce oppress</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="6.66">the honest and open the door to every</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="5.7">species of fraud and injustice Jefferson</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="6.51">wrote to Colonel Edward Carrington on</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="7.29">May 27th 1788 paper is poverty it is</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="6.45">only the ghosts of money and not money</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="6.72">itself in 1817 Jefferson predicted paper</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="5.01">money will bring abuses also are</text>
  <text start="406.34" dur="5.58">inevitable and by breaking up the</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="6.6">measure of value make a lottery of all</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="5.73">private property Jefferson insisted in</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="5.28">1784 if we determined that a dollar</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="6.45">shall be a our unit we must then say</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="5.28">with precision what a dollar is and we</text>
  <text start="424.1" dur="2.99">need to understand that our founding</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="5.419">fathers</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="8.13">they knew what a central bank can do to</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="7.47">a country this was also part of breaking</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="5.58">free of England because England was</text>
  <text start="438.639" dur="5.431">controlled by a central bank system and</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="5.91">they knew that here in the United States</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="5.43">we should never allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="446.71" dur="5.58">again again this is why Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="3.99">when after the second central bank here</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="3.06">in the United States and this is why I</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="5.06">do believe that Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="6.15">will be going after that third one</text>
  <text start="458.55" dur="8.32">because remember the central bank they</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="8.58">like to take control of whatever country</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="6.78">they can control and they keep trying</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="6.69">they don&amp;#39;t give up it&amp;#39;s something they</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="6">continue to do even when the central</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="6.03">bank is thrown out years later they hope</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="6.03">people will forget people won&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="4.589">what the central bank has done and when</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="5.16">people start to forget what they do is</text>
  <text start="487.389" dur="7.471">they sneakily force their way back in</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="9.12">and just like in 1913 what did they do</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="7.47">they signed the act during the latter</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="5.28">part of the year at night so no one</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="7.32">would know what was going on but when we</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="10.41">look at other countries empires we see</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="8.12">that this fiat based system it does not</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="6.17">work and when we look at other empires</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="7.33">we can see that these falling empires</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="7.38">their currency lost value because they</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="8.04">were debased and it added to the fall of</text>
  <text start="529.2" dur="6.94">their system look at the Roman Empire</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="4.71">look at the yuan dynasty of China the</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="4.41">Ottoman Empire the French Empire the</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="4.83">British Empire is Soviet Union Zimbabwe</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="4.71">even Venezuela you look at all these</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="5.64">countries they have something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="5.85">very in common they keep printing and</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="5.25">printing and printing why more Germany</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="5.28">same exact thing</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="5.7">and we concede here in this country and</text>
  <text start="556.39" dur="5.34">people can see it around the world think</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="4.89">about it go back in time go back to a</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="5.01">period of time before the central bank</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="5.1">system when you&amp;#39;re able to walk into a</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="6.75">store with a penny and this is way</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="7.05">before 1913 and you can buy maybe two</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="5.52">pieces of bubblegum a hard candy and</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="7.41">maybe something else try to do that</text>
  <text start="579.01" dur="7.56">today why isn&amp;#39;t that penny why doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="8.07">why doesn&amp;#39;t have the same purchasing</text>
  <text start="586.57" dur="7.89">power as it once did why did it lose its</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="7.17">purchasing power because when you create</text>
  <text start="594.46" dur="7.38">currency and you attach interest to it</text>
  <text start="598.96" dur="5.88">and you keep creating the currency with</text>
  <text start="601.84" dur="5.49">no checks and balances it loses value</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="4.95">over time you can see it from 1913 all</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="4.86">the way up to the present day haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="6.57">you ever wondered why everyone needs</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="6.81">credit cards today why everyone has to</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="4.94">have some type of credit to survive and</text>
  <text start="619" dur="7.53">we&amp;#39;ve said this many times before</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="9.37">remove credit from everyday life how</text>
  <text start="626.53" dur="8.49">many people can survive not many many</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="8.82">people today have to have credit one way</text>
  <text start="635.02" dur="8.58">or another the reason for that is</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="6.81">because your currency that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.6" dur="5.73">holding is continually losing value</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="6.57">which means you need more of that same</text>
  <text start="649.33" dur="7.41">currency to buy the exact same item the</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="6.93">item has not changed what has happened</text>
  <text start="656.74" dur="6.09">was is that your currency had lost value</text>
  <text start="659.8" dur="4.74">do you think gum and hard candy today do</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="4.98">you think it&amp;#39;s more expensive to produce</text>
  <text start="664.54" dur="9.82">no actually with technology today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.81" dur="9.999">less expensive but it costs more</text>
  <text start="674.36" dur="5.729">why because it has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="677.809" dur="4.77">the product it has to do with your</text>
  <text start="680.089" dur="5.16">currency losing value and this is what</text>
  <text start="682.579" dur="6.211">the founding fathers have warned us</text>
  <text start="685.249" dur="6.75">about from the very beginning and this</text>
  <text start="688.79" dur="5.609">is why we&amp;#39;re on our third private Wesen</text>
  <text start="691.999" dur="4.8">central bank because they always try to</text>
  <text start="694.399" dur="7.37">creep back in and they did in 1913 and</text>
  <text start="696.799" dur="7.23">here we are once again with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="701.769" dur="5.41">removing the corruption now when we talk</text>
  <text start="704.029" dur="4.71">about the corruption when you have this</text>
  <text start="707.179" dur="2.94">credit card and that&amp;#39;s really what the</text>
  <text start="708.739" dur="3.81">Federal Reserve is it&amp;#39;s just this big</text>
  <text start="710.119" dur="4.41">credit card and you know with credit</text>
  <text start="712.549" dur="6.63">cards there&amp;#39;s interest attached when you</text>
  <text start="714.529" dur="6.691">borrow those funds well those people in</text>
  <text start="719.179" dur="4.83">government when you can continually</text>
  <text start="721.22" dur="6.269">borrow and borrow and borrow and you</text>
  <text start="724.009" dur="8.37">don&amp;#39;t have to account for anything what</text>
  <text start="727.489" dur="6.931">happens you breed corruption when no</text>
  <text start="732.379" dur="4.32">one&amp;#39;s following these funds and you can</text>
  <text start="734.42" dur="5.459">just ask for more you can have these</text>
  <text start="736.699" dur="5.13">funds go out to a program they could</text>
  <text start="739.879" dur="2.841">launder it and it can come right back to</text>
  <text start="741.829" dur="3.92">your pocket</text>
  <text start="742.72" dur="6.909">the founding fathers warned us of this</text>
  <text start="745.749" dur="8.17">that it breeds corruption and here we</text>
  <text start="749.629" dur="7.221">are with the third central bank with the</text>
  <text start="753.919" dur="5.61">Patriots going after that corruption</text>
  <text start="756.85" dur="6.069">remember the Patriots need to remove a</text>
  <text start="759.529" dur="6.331">lot of these blocks before they get to</text>
  <text start="762.919" dur="5.431">the source and once they get to the</text>
  <text start="765.86" dur="6.75">source which is the central bank we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="768.35" dur="7.429">going to see real change we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="772.61" dur="8">see the population completely change</text>
