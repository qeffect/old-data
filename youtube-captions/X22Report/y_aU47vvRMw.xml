  <text start="559.98" dur="5.01">in their best interests and we can see</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="4.11">right now that people will be rising up</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="4.05">and we could see across the entire world</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="3.39">right now they are getting prepared for</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="4.47">this they realize when this collapse</text>

  <text start="586.14" dur="3.15">nationalizing the police forces here in</text>
  <text start="587.76" dur="3.42">the United States they&amp;#39;re giving them</text>

  <text start="620.01" dur="4.44">police offers officers for civil</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="3.81">disobedience and we see many other areas</text>
  <text start="624.45" dur="3.9">where they&amp;#39;re purchasing things like</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="5.13">water cannons to keep control of the</text>

  <text start="638.31" dur="4.71">know who is going to be a threat to</text>

  <text start="643.02" dur="4.35">ramping up to spare the spy programs</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="4.41">this is why we saw this false flag and</text>
  <text start="647.37" dur="5.7">all of a sudden all these countries now</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="5.699">have troops on the ground they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.07" dur="5.97">pushing their agendas of spying on more</text>

  <text start="678.779" dur="6.451">take a time off of fighting while they</text>

  <text start="685.23" dur="4.56">Ukraine the fighting has not stopped it</text>
  <text start="687.029" dur="5.221">actually it&amp;#39;s intensifying and we</text>
  <text start="689.79" dur="4.859">realize what&amp;#39;s going on there the Kiev</text>

  <text start="694.649" dur="5.31">major major offensive they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="697.649" dur="4.38">make their move they&amp;#39;re waiting for the</text>
  <text start="699.959" dur="4.471">right false flag event to blame the</text>
  <text start="702.029" dur="5.221">southeastern people or Russia and we</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="5.01">could see it&amp;#39;s building up by more and</text>
  <text start="707.25" dur="4.769">more people being drafted into the army</text>
  <text start="709.44" dur="6.18">more more lethal weapons coming in</text>
  <text start="712.019" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re getting ready and prepared now</text>
  <text start="715.62" dur="4.7">yesterday I reported on the United</text>
  <text start="717.57" dur="6.18">States was going to send about 400</text>
  <text start="720.32" dur="5.65">trainers to train the Syrian moderates</text>
  <text start="723.75" dur="5.07">but see that number is now being bumped</text>
  <text start="725.97" dur="4.92">up we&amp;#39;ve seen us a lot actually the the</text>
  <text start="728.82" dur="5.04">number of troops that are always going</text>
  <text start="730.89" dur="4.379">into Iraq usually end up to be a lot</text>
  <text start="733.86" dur="3.93">more than what they&amp;#39;re saying so right</text>
  <text start="735.269" dur="3.871">now the Pentagon has announced that a</text>
  <text start="737.79" dur="5.07">mission to train the moderate Syrian</text>
  <text start="739.14" dur="6.569">opposition&amp;#39;s may involve over 1,000 US</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="5.25">troops earlier they said about 400 but</text>
  <text start="745.709" dur="4.5">John Kirby was out there saying no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.11" dur="3.96">going to be a thousand plus we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="750.209" dur="3.721">sure right now and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="4.079">this is total mission creep and we know</text>
  <text start="753.93" dur="4.74">these are combat-ready Marines ready to</text>
  <text start="756.149" dur="5.31">go and we also know that President Obama</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="5.52">is trying to get troops into this area</text>
  <text start="761.459" dur="5.701">everything is set up in Iraq to accept</text>
  <text start="764.19" dur="5.459">these troops the airbase the Division</text>
  <text start="767.16" dur="5.16">Headquarters they are prepared they have</text>
  <text start="769.649" dur="6.12">military assets now being transferred</text>
  <text start="772.32" dur="5.85">from Afghanistan down into Kuwait in to</text>
  <text start="775.769" dur="4.981">depose to get ready to mount their</text>
  <text start="778.17" dur="6.779">offensive and they&amp;#39;re just getting ready</text>
  <text start="780.75" dur="6.51">and soon we will see this happen now we</text>
  <text start="784.949" dur="5.76">see the United States in the UK they are</text>
  <text start="787.26" dur="4.889">having a joint cyber cell exercise the</text>
  <text start="790.709" dur="3.12">United States and unite and the United</text>
  <text start="792.149" dur="3.781">Kingdom are working on establishing a</text>
  <text start="793.829" dur="4.76">joint cyber cell that will help to</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="6.81">countries improve cooperation on</text>
  <text start="798.589" dur="6.61">cybersecurity hmm very interesting the</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="3.46">joint exercise will be on the financial</text>
  <text start="805.199" dur="3.171">sector</text>
  <text start="806.2" dur="4.57">so they want to see what are the</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="6.33">weaknesses what we have to protect but</text>
  <text start="810.77" dur="6.36">is that really what they&amp;#39;re doing now we</text>
  <text start="814.7" dur="4.5">understand they have already implemented</text>
  <text start="817.13" dur="4.68">kill switches on the stock exchange bats</text>
  <text start="819.2" dur="4.47">and Nasdaq systems so when the markets</text>
  <text start="821.81" dur="4.92">tarps starts to fall they can kill it</text>
  <text start="823.67" dur="7.35">and stop it whenever they want we also</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="7.44">see that when a cyber attack actually</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="7.26">hits the FDIC does not cover this</text>
  <text start="834.17" dur="7.05">whatsoever so if you lose money during</text>
  <text start="838.28" dur="6.45">this time period the FDIC is not going</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="5.73">to come to your come to your aid because</text>
  <text start="844.73" dur="4.05">this is not part of that insurance they</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="3.63">have separate insurance that will deal</text>
  <text start="848.78" dur="4.38">with this but we&amp;#39;ll have to see if they</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="4.46">actually will cover the losses and we</text>
  <text start="853.16" dur="3.57">know when these cyber attacks hit</text>
  <text start="855.04" dur="3.64">basically what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="856.73" dur="4.26">shut down everything and they have the</text>
  <text start="858.68" dur="4.47">belly on the bail and documents to go</text>
  <text start="860.99" dur="4.44">into the bank to bail out the documents</text>
  <text start="863.15" dur="4.2">to bit to bail out the banks I should</text>
  <text start="865.43" dur="5.61">say and we can see right now the joint</text>
  <text start="867.35" dur="8.13">exercises in the financial sector will</text>
  <text start="871.04" dur="7.53">help the UK and the United States deal</text>
  <text start="875.48" dur="5.04">with whatever is coming and I talked</text>
  <text start="878.57" dur="4.11">about this in my other reports back in</text>
  <text start="880.52" dur="4.92">2003 when I was in Manhattan and we had</text>
  <text start="882.68" dur="6.09">that blackout I do believe this was a</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="6.15">test to see if they could bring down the</text>
  <text start="888.77" dur="5.19">power grid and they were successful in</text>
  <text start="891.59" dur="4.68">doing so just like in the World Trade</text>
  <text start="893.96" dur="4.83">Center when they had the bombing</text>
  <text start="896.27" dur="5.43">underneath the World Trade Center towers</text>
  <text start="898.79" dur="5.22">that was a test to see how things would</text>
  <text start="901.7" dur="5.34">go and what they could do and we can see</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="6.06">they do this quite a bit and we know for</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="5.55">a fact that when this attack hits it</text>
  <text start="910.07" dur="5.61">will be from the inside it will be from</text>
  <text start="912.59" dur="6.51">the government&amp;#39;s because as we know they</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="6.27">push their agenda and they use false</text>
  <text start="919.1" dur="4.53">flag events to get the people to do what</text>
  <text start="921.95" dur="4.59">they want to do we already see a cyber</text>
  <text start="923.63" dur="5.9">attack on the New York Post and the</text>
  <text start="926.54" dur="5.07">united press international UPI and</text>
  <text start="929.53" dur="4.63">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="931.61" dur="5.05">this is all going on during the time</text>
  <text start="934.16" dur="6.099">period when they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="936.66" dur="6.659">spa or that rewritten version of sista</text>
  <text start="940.259" dur="4.62">past and all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re ramping</text>
  <text start="943.319" dur="5.101">up these cyber attacks but the message</text>
  <text start="944.879" dur="7.591">is very interesting where the message</text>
  <text start="948.42" dur="5.64">was world war three is the cleared by</text>
  <text start="952.47" dur="4.679">the Pope China and the United States</text>
  <text start="954.06" dur="6.589">engaged in a serious military battle why</text>
  <text start="957.149" dur="7.201">would the hackers put that message on</text>
  <text start="960.649" dur="7.12">the the feeds just like when the Syrian</text>
  <text start="964.35" dur="6.21">electronic army put on a lot of the</text>
  <text start="967.769" dur="6.781">corporate media&amp;#39;s which they hacked they</text>
  <text start="970.56" dur="6.48">put China dropped the dollar they</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="4.139">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that this is very</text>
  <text start="977.04" dur="4.26">interesting to me and we know the Syrian</text>
  <text start="978.689" dur="4.471">electronic army is a fictitious hacking</text>
  <text start="981.3" dur="5.459">group which is made up probably most</text>
  <text start="983.16" dur="6.179">likely by the CIA Mossad mi6 to convince</text>
  <text start="986.759" dur="4.291">us that Syria is hacking the United</text>
  <text start="989.339" dur="3.271">States but on these Twitter feeds they</text>
  <text start="991.05" dur="3.99">were filled with reports of China</text>
  <text start="992.61" dur="6.029">condemning President Obama&amp;#39;s pivot to</text>
  <text start="995.04" dur="6.18">Asia before firing on and damaging of</text>
  <text start="998.639" dur="4.56">the USS George Washington in American</text>
  <text start="1001.22" dur="3.96">aircraft aircraft carrier based in the</text>
  <text start="1003.199" dur="3.591">Pacific the feeds also stated that the</text>
  <text start="1005.18" dur="6.509">u.s. was involved in active combat</text>

  <text start="1013.97" dur="5.52">Washington damaged US Navy now engaged</text>
  <text start="1017" dur="4.8">in active combat against Chinese vessels</text>
  <text start="1019.49" dur="5.37">in the South China Sea and these were</text>
  <text start="1021.8" dur="4.98">the readings from the tweets so we can</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="3.78">see this is a very interesting message</text>
  <text start="1026.78" dur="4.379">that they&amp;#39;re throwing at us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1028.64" dur="4.86">trying to tell us that yes war is coming</text>
  <text start="1031.159" dur="5.55">and we know it is we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="6.059">this for a very long time and we could</text>
  <text start="1036.709" dur="6.12">see because of all these false flag</text>
  <text start="1039.559" dur="5.01">events they&amp;#39;re putting troops all over</text>
  <text start="1042.829" dur="4.051">the place in each one of the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.569" dur="4.921">Spain France and now Belgium they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.88" dur="4.26">putting about 300 soldiers and they will</text>
  <text start="1049.49" dur="4.74">be deployed in the capital Brussels and</text>
  <text start="1051.14" dur="4.47">they will stay there and we can see a</text>
  <text start="1054.23" dur="4.92">lot of the countries are doing this the</text>
  <text start="1055.61" dur="7.29">UK is doing it everyone is getting ready</text>
  <text start="1059.15" dur="7.68">they&amp;#39;re putting their troops on high</text>
  <text start="1062.9" dur="6.749">alert getting prepared for the collapse</text>
  <text start="1066.83" dur="3.63">of the entire system in the meantime</text>
  <text start="1069.649" dur="2.701">there</text>
  <text start="1070.46" dur="2.94">course trying to take away more and more</text>
  <text start="1072.35" dur="3.6">of your rights because they need to</text>
  <text start="1073.4" dur="4.95">understand who is a threat they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="1075.95" dur="5.64">telling us that there&amp;#39;s up to 20 sleeper</text>

  <text start="1081.59" dur="5.61">ready to strike in European countries</text>
  <text start="1084.68" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re already telling us that their</text>
  <text start="1087.2" dur="4.62">sleeper cells here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1089.06" dur="6.09">now I talked about this many many many</text>
  <text start="1091.82" dur="4.77">reports back when we talked about lone</text>
  <text start="1095.15" dur="4.67">wolf groups and I actually had a picture</text>
  <text start="1096.59" dur="6.51">of a wolf wearing an eye patch and an</text>
  <text start="1099.82" dur="5.2">ak-47 now we understand these people</text>
  <text start="1103.1" dur="3.98">have already been pre-positioned this is</text>
  <text start="1105.02" dur="5.76">not terrorists these are government</text>

  <text start="1112.49" dur="4.71">false flag event this is what is coming</text>
  <text start="1115.31" dur="2.94">and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="1117.2" dur="3.6">prepared but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1118.25" dur="4.35">about all this terrorism and we know</text>
  <text start="1120.8" dur="4.08">that all their methods to protect us</text>
  <text start="1122.6" dur="4.05">actually does not work because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1124.88" dur="3.72">not really put into place to protect us</text>
  <text start="1126.65" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re really put in a place to scare</text>
  <text start="1128.6" dur="7.59">us to spy on us but the real terrorism</text>
  <text start="1133.49" dur="6.27">facts might be a little stunning too</text>
  <text start="1136.19" dur="5.1">many of the people out there Daniel</text>

  <text start="1154.27" dur="4.69">despite the horror there have been</text>
