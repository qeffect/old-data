  <text start="95.719" dur="6.371">going against the global system just</text>
  <text start="99.719" dur="5.76">like Trump did in the very beginning and</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="7.55">now we see Boris Johnson doing the same</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="8.911">thing now what did Boris Johnson just do</text>

  <text start="114.39" dur="7.53">attending the Swiss World Economic Forum</text>
  <text start="117.17" dur="6.64">including himself now why did he do this</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="5.43">well remember this is an annual</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="8.33">gathering of the global elite so he</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="8.37">banned everyone from the Davos summit</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="7.6">what has Trump done in the past he has</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="7.86">not gone to these type of summits he</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="8.04">didn&amp;#39;t sign on to the Paris climate</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="8.19">Accord he did away with their trade</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="5.8">deals Boris Johnson is doing the same</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="7.24">thing</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="7.38">why because they know it&amp;#39;s time to end</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="6.18">this system why do you think the people</text>
  <text start="160.96" dur="7.38">in the UK are voting to separate</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="7.17">themselves from the EU this is a failed</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="6.99">experiment by the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="172.36" dur="6.38">were using the EU to show everyone how</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="6.66">great it was going to be to have one</text>
  <text start="178.74" dur="5.98">centralized currency this is what they</text>
  <text start="181.99" dur="6.6">wanted to do to the world but their plan</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="6.96">was to control every country bring in</text>
  <text start="188.59" dur="8.01">the TPP you would have courts above</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="7.62">governments all of that has failed the</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="5.58">Patriots are now shutting it all down</text>
  <text start="199.3" dur="7.02">and once other countries start to</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="6.72">realize that the UK is better off they</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="4.74">have better trade deals we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="4.05">see other countries say you know</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="4.7">something it&amp;#39;s time to separate</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="5.1">ourselves and you&amp;#39;re going to see the EU</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="3.39">completely disintegrate right in front</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="5.07">of our eyes</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="6.97">now remember Trump of the Patriots their</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="4.68">entire plan is to run this system into</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="4.29">the ground this is a central bank system</text>
  <text start="227.8" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t get confused Trump is not out</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="4.38">there trying to repair the central bank</text>
  <text start="232.36" dur="6.12">he&amp;#39;s not trying to make it better than</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="5.55">it was before his entire mission is to</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="3.45">run this thing into the ground and</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing how do</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="6.93">you do this you keep piling on more and</text>
  <text start="245.11" dur="5.79">more debt until the system breaks now</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="3.87">yes in the past we&amp;#39;ve had other</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="4.08">presidents pile on debt Obama right</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="4.97">before him piled on a lot of debt but</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="6.17">their plan was not to destroy the system</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="7.6">their plan was the pile on the debt</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="8.65">bring us into an event probably with</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="9.13">Hillary Clinton if she won and have the</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="6.5">system restarted later on</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="5.97">remember there was going to be an event</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="6.36">a war to cover up the entire world</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="6.16">economic collapse this is what they use</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="6.599">to cover up what their system does to</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="5.28">every single economy around the world it</text>
  <text start="289.259" dur="5.671">destroys it and in the end their system</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="6.81">destroys itself and they need something</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="5.88">to cover it up that plan has failed so</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="4.59">what is Trump doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="5.82">continually using all their weapons</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="8.1">against them and at the same time he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="6.629">building the transitional economy at the</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="4.65">same time so what does he have to do he</text>
  <text start="313.259" dur="4.081">has the central bank economy which he</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="3.959">has to make it look like it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="5.31">fantastically statistically of course</text>
  <text start="319.949" dur="5.15">and then he has the transitional economy</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="4.949">where he&amp;#39;s bringing back manufacturers</text>
  <text start="325.099" dur="5.741">creating new trade deals we had this</text>
  <text start="327.599" dur="4.5">before this is nothing new this is when</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="3.57">we went off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="332.099" dur="4.831">and we went on to a full Fiat system in</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="3.749">the 60s they were doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="1.53">thing Kissinger was out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="338.159" dur="2.701">East</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="3.709">setting up the deals with the Middle</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="4.91">Eastern countries you will accept</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="6.671">dollars only for the sale of oil and</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="5.95">when the time is right we&amp;#39;ll remove the</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="6.66">system from gold and we&amp;#39;ll be on a full</text>
  <text start="351.72" dur="7.74">fiat system because once the entire</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="6.599">world is on the Federal Reserve Note you</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="6.69">can then control each and every one of</text>
  <text start="362.099" dur="7.621">these countries the EU did it in the EU</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="5.34">with the ECB they made all the country</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="4.56">sign on saying it&amp;#39;s gonna be better than</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="4.56">sliced bread and it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="4.319">better for you we&amp;#39;ll be able to control</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="5.25">everything and it will make it a lot</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="4.771">easier you&amp;#39;ll see the economy grow now</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="5.429">in the beginning stages that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="5.57">always happens the system grows because</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;re creating a lot of fiat currency</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="6.34">you&amp;#39;re loaning currency countries are</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="4.71">borrowing that currency and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="4.859">feels great same thing when the Federal</text>
  <text start="397.409" dur="5.01">Reserve came off the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="400.139" dur="6">went on to a fiat system everyone felt</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="5.081">great but as the system approaches its</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="3.281">end life</text>
  <text start="407.5" dur="4.67">that&amp;#39;s when everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="409.42" dur="7.53">apart and that&amp;#39;s where we are right now</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="7.9">so Trump he is now pushing this system</text>
  <text start="416.95" dur="6.75">to the very edge which means he needs</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="6.24">rates cuts he needs stimulus and he</text>
  <text start="423.7" dur="5.4">needs that drug to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="4.59">and you could see it&amp;#39;s having effect he</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="3.39">tweeted out the following the stock</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="4.89">market hit another record high yesterday</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="5.82">number 133 in less than three years as</text>
  <text start="435.79" dur="4.89">your all-time favorite president and the</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.32">radical left do-nothing Democrats want</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="2.67">to impeach me don&amp;#39;t worry I have done</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="3.72">nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="443.35" dur="4.92">actually they have and he&amp;#39;s right about</text>
  <text start="446.35" dur="4.02">that we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in the</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="6.24">next report but when you look you can</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="7.1">see us manufacturing it is rebounded you</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="6.84">see the housing market is improving</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="5.85">people have jobs now are these the</text>
  <text start="461.35" dur="5.52">high-paying jobs that we would all like</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="7.11">no but what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s going to all</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="6.57">those people in the lower middle class</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="6.54">below the middle class he&amp;#39;s getting all</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="6.72">these individuals jobs to get them off</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="6.19">the programs that the government puts</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="5.49">out there like food stamps what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="5.16">doing he&amp;#39;s getting he&amp;#39;s reducing the</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="6.09">expenses of government this has to be</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="5.67">done for the transition and Trump is</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="4.71">going to continually hit the fed over</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="4.83">and over and over until he gets what he</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="4.32">wants I do believe this is why he had</text>
  <text start="498.82" dur="4.53">the meeting with Powell in the White</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="4.74">House to explain you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="6.96">doing what I want now did he say that</text>

  <text start="510.31" dur="6.69">message to let him know that we need</text>
  <text start="513.46" dur="7.29">more rate cuts we need more stimulus we</text>
  <text start="517" dur="7.01">need to push this economy so it looks</text>
  <text start="520.75" dur="5.76">like no other economy in the world and</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="6.22">this is exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="7.32">right on cue Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="5.78">tweeted would be so great if the Fed</text>
  <text start="533.83" dur="4.65">with further lower interest rates and</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="3.82">quantitative ease the dollar is very</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="1.96">strong against other currencies and</text>

  <text start="552.47" dur="5.28">Federal Reserve and they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="554.33" dur="6.33">idea that the Fed is no longer going to</text>
