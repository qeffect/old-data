  <text start="229.75" dur="4.47">countries they would love to start</text>
  <text start="232.269" dur="6.961">spreading the debt throughout the</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="7.71">country&amp;#39;s now Cuba they were one of the</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="7.14">founding members of the IMF until it</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="8.16">quit in 1964 well we all know what</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="7.83">happened back then but the end the IMF</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="8.01">right now they would love to get back</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="7.14">into Cuba and to put the country into</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="6.45">debt to spread more debt now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="6.72">hoping that Cuba will make a formal</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="6.78">request for membership into the IMF they</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="6.72">haven&amp;#39;t done this yet but the IMF is</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="8.459">looking to approach them in joining up</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="7.259">with the IMF and remember without doing</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="4.231">this because the product of the central</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="4.641">bank is debt that&amp;#39;s all they have is</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="4.74">dead put the countries into debt and</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="4.72">robbed the country of the natural</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="4.56">resources sell them off for pennies on</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="5.03">the dollar that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="293.32" dur="6.17">Greece in Cyprus in France</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="5.16">in Portugal all these countries are in</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="4.8">debt some are a little bit further into</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.03">debt than others and it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="304.29" dur="6.54">as it spreads all throughout the private</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="6.3">western central bank countries now here</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="4.35">in the United States we realize and we</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="4.53">discuss this over the weekend that the</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="5.25">American people they are tapped out at</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="2.7">this point we understand the government</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="1.98">is trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="3.33">unemployment is a four point nine</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="4.38">percent but we realize that this number</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="4.41">is completely manipulated massage and</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s not the real number for</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="5.61">unemployment real unemployment depending</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="5.94">on which source you go to is anywhere</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="5.94">from 25 to 30 percent because you</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="4.5">remember those people who are being laid</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="5.73">off right now who can&amp;#39;t find work who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="6.18">been looking for for weeks sending out</text>
  <text start="346.17" dur="5.46">resumes those people are counted anyone</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.5">beyond that they don&amp;#39;t count them</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="5.07">anymore they feel oh they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="5.19">interested in getting a job and many</text>
  <text start="356.7" dur="4.74">people are finding it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="4.11">find that same high-paying job so they</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="5.37">have to take on one two three part-time</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="7.98">jobs but what&amp;#39;s very interesting and we</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="6.39">talked about the corporate income tax to</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="5.19">the government where that is telling us</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="5.28">the story that unemployment is not where</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="3.75">it the government says it is well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.48" dur="3.93">starting to see that the federal income</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="4.23">and employment tax withholdings the</text>
  <text start="382.41" dur="5.88">broadest and most timely read on the</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="9.57">health of the job market it has been</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="8.85">sinking very quickly the IRS and</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="5.64">treasury data shows refunds tracking two</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="6.51">to three percent below last year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.27" dur="7.17">levels so we have the corporate taxes</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="6.09">for the employees those are dropping and</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="5.88">the refunds they&amp;#39;re dropping two to</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="5.1">three percent this is not good news for</text>
  <text start="412.32" dur="5.52">companies that focus on low end</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="6.45">consumers who depend on their tax</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="5.51">returns to go spend them in retail so</text>
  <text start="421.29" dur="4.38">this is a major problem remember Walmart</text>
  <text start="423.35" dur="3.46">where they&amp;#39;re saying oh we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="1.98">waiting for the tax season because</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="2.49">they&amp;#39;re going to come in with their</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="2.519">refunds and they&amp;#39;re going to spend a lot</text>
  <text start="429.3" dur="3.54">more</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="6.21">the people never showed up and sales in</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="5.34">walmart dropped revenue in walmart</text>
  <text start="436.379" dur="4.44">dropped and we&amp;#39;re seeing this throughout</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="5.97">all these different stores where retail</text>
  <text start="440.819" dur="7.38">is contracting and what we see right now</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="8.299">is that the growth rate of individual</text>
  <text start="448.199" dur="9.08">tax receipts is showing signs of a major</text>
  <text start="452.449" dur="9.4">slowdown now this goes back to 2015 and</text>
  <text start="457.279" dur="7.211">this tells us that something is going on</text>
  <text start="461.849" dur="5.16">well we kind of know what&amp;#39;s going on we</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="6.829">know that people aren&amp;#39;t employed we know</text>
  <text start="467.009" dur="6.84">people are just making ends meet and</text>
  <text start="471.319" dur="5.291">what we see right now is the types of</text>
  <text start="473.849" dur="6.69">jobs the US economy has been creating</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="8.1">over the last year our lower paying then</text>
  <text start="480.539" dur="9.391">average lower marginal income lead to</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="7.769">lower tax refunds and eventually this</text>
  <text start="489.93" dur="5.969">trend finds its way into the DAX into</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="6.21">the tax data this also tells us that the</text>
  <text start="495.899" dur="8.341">true pace of job growth has been slowing</text>
  <text start="498.689" dur="9.15">and it also tells us that people cannot</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="9.06">find jobs you need a job to get a refund</text>
  <text start="507.839" dur="7.401">and we see at this point from all the</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.07">other data that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="5.77">where we see credit cards in the</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="5.43">trillions of dollars where people have</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="8.009">spent more on their credit cards in 2015</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="9.14">then in 2009-2010 and 2011 combined this</text>
  <text start="529.019" dur="6.361">tells us that people are depending on</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="5.32">their credit cards because remember when</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="5.76">you lose that job and you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="538.26" dur="5.009">unemployment or your unemployment runs</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="4.29">out and you can get a part-time job or</text>
  <text start="543.269" dur="5.731">you have two part-time jobs which</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="6.51">doesn&amp;#39;t equal the full-time salary you</text>
  <text start="549" dur="5.519">depend on your credit cards to make it</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="3.329">by because in your head and what the</text>
  <text start="554.519" dur="2.31">corporate media and the government</text>
  <text start="555.269" dur="3.211">continually tells us is that</text>
  <text start="556.829" dur="2.911">unemployment at four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="2.549">don&amp;#39;t worry you&amp;#39;ll be getting a job and</text>
  <text start="559.74" dur="4.14">those people that are putting out</text>
  <text start="561.029" dur="5.611">resumes are saying where are the jobs</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="4.83">so all these pieces are starting to fit</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="5.43">together right now and it&amp;#39;s showing us</text>
  <text start="568.71" dur="5.13">that this economy is completely fake</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="4.95">phony and false it is a complete</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="5.85">illusion now today we see the stock</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="5.52">market it finished up a little bit in</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="5.31">the green but if we go back a couple of</text>
  <text start="582.54" dur="5.82">weeks or if we go back to January of</text>
  <text start="585" dur="5.58">2016 we see the market started off in a</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="4.11">downward trajectory and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.58" dur="3.36">bouncing around on top we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="2.55">before back in two thousand eight before</text>
  <text start="593.94" dur="5.01">the whole thing came crashing down</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="9">actually in 1929 and 2001 it is the same</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="8.12">exact scenario and we also see at this</text>
  <text start="604.02" dur="8.93">point that for a couple days in a row</text>
  <text start="607.07" dur="10.09">gold has been pushed down quite a bit</text>
  <text start="612.95" dur="6.52">this tells us something because gold was</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="6.93">inching up it reached a certain point</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="6.57">and the central bankers those elite they</text>
  <text start="624.09" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want gold moving up so they need</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="5.37">to continually push it down but if you</text>
  <text start="628.53" dur="6.03">notice they can&amp;#39;t push it down to the</text>
  <text start="631.41" dur="4.38">levels where it once was so today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="634.56" dur="4.83">still over the twelve hundred dollar</text>
  <text start="635.79" dur="5.73">mark and most likely gold will start</text>
  <text start="639.39" dur="3.57">shooting up once again and I&amp;#39;ll make it</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="5.25">more and more difficult to push down</text>
  <text start="642.96" dur="5.82">this is a sign where its showing us that</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re losing control now if we reach</text>
  <text start="648.78" dur="7.31">1300 and or 1300 plus and they can only</text>
  <text start="653.28" dur="5.34">push it down to 1300 we are on our way</text>
  <text start="656.09" dur="5.62">where they are completely losing control</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="5.7">and gold is trying to break out and push</text>
  <text start="661.71" dur="5.97">out and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="664.32" dur="6.69">physical gold demand is very strong in</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="4.74">emerging markets not very strong here in</text>
  <text start="671.01" dur="3.51">the United States except those people</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="3.9">that are awake rest of the people like</text>
  <text start="674.52" dur="6.27">gold why would I want that I have paper</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="8.37">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that consumers in other</text>
  <text start="680.79" dur="7.68">countries they are just getting physical</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="5.85">gold hand over fist I just want it</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="7.76">because what&amp;#39;s happening is their</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="5.69">currencies in the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="696.79" dur="5.83">have fallen sharply in the last 12 to 18</text>
  <text start="700.04" dur="4.5">months against the US dollar prompting</text>
  <text start="702.62" dur="8.88">consumers in these markets to buy</text>
  <text start="704.54" dur="9.63">physical gold and once gold starts</text>
  <text start="711.5" dur="4.77">shooting up here people will not be able</text>
  <text start="714.17" dur="4.62">to get it this should give you a signal</text>
  <text start="716.27" dur="5.22">and if you&amp;#39;re not still sure wait a</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="4.98">couple weeks see where gold goes if we</text>
  <text start="721.49" dur="6.42">make it over 1300 and they can only push</text>
  <text start="723.77" dur="7.05">it down to 12 90 or right at 1300 we can</text>
  <text start="727.91" dur="5.94">see we&amp;#39;re on our way and personally I</text>
  <text start="730.82" dur="7.47">would not wait any time past this i mean</text>

  <text start="804.05" dur="7.5">for Obamacare and guess what they did it</text>
  <text start="808.339" dur="5.101">very quietly on Friday because they</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="4.98">didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.44" dur="6.66">really going on with Obamacare Obamacare</text>
  <text start="816.53" dur="6.3">is a complete disaster enrollments right</text>

  <text start="822.83" dur="6.05">million in the last half of 2015 there</text>
  <text start="826.49" dur="3.51">were a large decline in exchange Romans</text>
  <text start="828.88" dur="3.58">final</text>
  <text start="830" dur="4.74">members were downgraded and we see</text>
  <text start="832.46" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s happening here is at the end of</text>
  <text start="834.74" dur="5.16">the open enrollment on februari 15 2015</text>
  <text start="836.96" dur="5.37">11 point 6 7 million people had selected</text>

  <text start="843.8" dur="6.09">million people were enrolled in the plan</text>
  <text start="846.26" dur="6.3">twenty-five percent declined why because</text>
  <text start="849.89" dur="5.07">they saw how much it was and they</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="4.86">decided you know what we just can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="854.96" dur="4.86">for it a lot of the exchanges almost</text>
  <text start="857.42" dur="8.16">half of them have gone out of business</text>
  <text start="859.82" dur="8.34">and a lot of people say that the health</text>

  <text start="875" dur="4.32">no it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to pay all this</text>
  <text start="877.67" dur="3.69">money and then pay to go to the doctor</text>
  <text start="879.32" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;d rather just pay the penalty or</text>
  <text start="881.36" dur="3.24">maybe some people aren&amp;#39;t even paying the</text>
  <text start="882.8" dur="5.22">penalty they just rather pay for the</text>
  <text start="884.6" dur="6.57">doctor&amp;#39;s visit that&amp;#39;s it the other thing</text>

  <text start="891.17" dur="6.96">were removed from the entire health care</text>
  <text start="894.95" dur="6.75">system because there was no way to</text>
