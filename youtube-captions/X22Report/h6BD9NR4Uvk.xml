  <text start="196.93" dur="5.97">understands they&amp;#39;re pushing him and we</text>
  <text start="200.739" dur="7.231">can see that NATO and the United States</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="9.96">they are continually moving military</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="7.079">assets all around this area and we see</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="3.87">that the Pentagon has deployed to mq-1</text>
  <text start="215.049" dur="4.05">predator long-range unmanned</text>

  <text start="225.73" dur="5.099">training mission or it&amp;#39;s a drill they</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="6.36">always seem to leave the troops and the</text>
  <text start="230.829" dur="10.111">equipment in that area it happens every</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="7.5">single time and we know that the United</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="2.97">States government central bankers will</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="4.289">not stop until they get a war started</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.53">and the United States is not ready for a</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="5.071">war whatsoever first of all the armed</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="7.44">forces are basically thinned out around</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="8.63">the globe in Africa Middle East Eastern</text>
  <text start="255.88" dur="7.71">Europe the equipment most of it is</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="6.22">obsolete some of it that&amp;#39;s brand new</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="6.54">doesn&amp;#39;t even work I mean we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="7.01">information that the radar systems that</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="6.78">are based in Greenland are from the</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="6.339">1950s Ashton Carter is saying that they</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="5.46">need to modernize this equipment because</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="5.871">when we go to war they can&amp;#39;t detect any</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="7.53">missiles coming in that direction so if</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="6.22">Russia while we&amp;#39;re at reward fires a</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.61">ballistic missile there&amp;#39;s no detection</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="8.7">whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="7.82">is not a war with Yemen Iraq Libya this</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="8.13">is war with an advanced actor that has</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="7.69">nuclear weapons this is not going to end</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="5.25">well and we can see they&amp;#39;re pushing very</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="6.71">hard for war you will see the push come</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="5.64">harder when this entire system collapses</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="4.24">we see the arleigh burke-class</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="4.5">guided-missile destroyer will take part</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="5.76">in the sea breeze 2015 international</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="6.42">naval drill in Ukraine the u.s. Donald</text>
  <text start="327.73" dur="5.79">cook is armed with two Aegis ballistic</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="5.49">missile defense system launchers with up</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="4.62">to 56 nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise</text>
  <text start="336.01" dur="5.73">missiles and also carries a crew of</text>
  <text start="338.14" dur="7.59">about 337 and this drill is going to run</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="6.27">through September 12 and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="5.67">this drill with NATO of course to</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="6.3">provoke Russia this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="5.64">right now it&amp;#39;s all about provoking</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="6.36">provoking China and we&amp;#39;re already at war</text>
  <text start="357.04" dur="8.06">with China in Africa and now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="360.67" dur="7.22">the explosion another one in China I</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="5.38">won&amp;#39;t be surprised if we see another</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="6.22">explosion someplace else to retaliate</text>
  <text start="370.48" dur="7.38">from the explosion in China because in</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="7.2">the tangent area that explosion was in a</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="5.82">port city getting word that it was next</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.05">to a supercomputer that handled the</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="7.14">economy marketing and things like that</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="7.68">and we understand if they destroy the</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="4.71">economy there they can blame it all on</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="5.28">China and then we had an explosion in</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="6.03">Japan so I&amp;#39;m expecting something else to</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="5.91">occur and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see if</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="4.89">this does happen but we&amp;#39;re already at</text>
  <text start="404.23" dur="6.27">war because wherever Russia and China is</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="7.14">the u.s. is there fighting them on the</text>
  <text start="410.5" dur="5.49">other side now we understand there is</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="4.59">war all throughout the Middle East right</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="3.39">now and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="3.27">on because the people in these countries</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="4.44">are rising up they don&amp;#39;t want the pub</text>
  <text start="421.45" dur="4.74">government in there and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="5.52">the central bank in their country so in</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="6.81">Yemen Libya Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="5.85">Syria all of this is happening we have a</text>
  <text start="433" dur="6.169">couple of Africa nations that this is</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="7.05">also happening in Nigeria Sudan and</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="5.711">others and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="4.53">people from all these worn torn</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="3.63">countries that can&amp;#39;t take the fighting</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.06">anymore they&amp;#39;re leaving their countries</text>
  <text start="448.51" dur="6.51">and they&amp;#39;re moving throughout Europe and</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="5.92">we&amp;#39;re starting to see chaos on the</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="6.24">borders with a lot of refugees who are</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="7.08">fleeing these areas this is what you see</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="6.45">when we&amp;#39;re in a world war where people</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="5.88">are trying to move away from the war and</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s no place to go and we are</text>
  <text start="470.71" dur="5.22">already seeing this I mean waves of</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="4.59">migrants are hitting the EU borders from</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="6.66">Greece Italy and hungry fleeing tensions</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="7.77">in Afghanistan Iran and Syria and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="8.07">just going to get worse we see Greece</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="8.04">stopped a ship that was loaded with</text>
  <text start="490.66" dur="8.04">weapons and it came from Turkey and it</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="7.019">was heaven heading towards Libya so I</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="6.54">wonder where all these weapons and</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="5.131">explosives who they were for most likely</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="4.02">the Islamic state the small group that</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="7.079">was there and most likely the government</text>
  <text start="509.26" dur="10.32">the puppet government of Libya to fight</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="10.561">and try to get back the country we see</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="8.699">that Russia has brought in their russian</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="6.57">jets into syria and right now russia is</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="6.151">saying yet these reports are completely</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="4.89">false we are not flying our jets around</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="4.02">and bombing the Islamic state we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="5.73">setting up a base we brought some of our</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="7.86">military assets but we are not attacking</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="6.179">the Islamic state as of yet but this</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re not going to I</text>
  <text start="547.779" dur="7.651">think Putin has just moved his chest</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="7.11">piece and said check or checkmate to the</text>
  <text start="555.43" dur="5.34">coalition forces and says okay your move</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="4.5">what are you going to do because he</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="1.98">understands the Islamic state is the</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="1.2">proxy</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="3.54">army for the United States government</text>
  <text start="563.47" dur="5.79">central bankers I mean he realizes</text>
  <text start="566.29" dur="5.16">what&amp;#39;s going on and he&amp;#39;s preparing right</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="7.16">now to back Assad this is why all this</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="7.11">hardware is coming in now the Dutch</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re saying that they might have to</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="5.01">bring in ground troops into Syria to</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="4.2">find out why there&amp;#39;s refugee problem is</text>
  <text start="583.57" dur="5.18">getting out of hand well no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="6.77">going in there to set up the safe zone</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="8.22">they&amp;#39;re going in there to battle Assad</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="8.29">we see the call for Australia for the</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="6.34">Dutch to come in and help out Plus</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="7.95">everyone else because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="7.02">ready to go after Assad the goal is</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="4.5">still the same the plan is still the</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="5.67">same they might try different tactics</text>
  <text start="613" dur="5.13">but they will not let up they do believe</text>
  <text start="616" dur="5.55">in their heads that if they get into</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="5.85">Syria this system will be propped up and</text>
  <text start="621.55" dur="3.51">everything will be fine they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="4.05">to put the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="5.97">resources set up a central bank build</text>
  <text start="628.03" dur="5.19">the oil pipeline and if Iran doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="631.03" dur="4.65">cooperate they&amp;#39;ll just go into Iran and</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.02">keep the dollar on their oil this is</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="2.64">their thinking right now and eventually</text>
  <text start="637.24" dur="3.06">what they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll go back into</text>
  <text start="638.32" dur="3.81">those other countries where the people</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="6.12">are throwing out the puppet governments</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="5.85">and we understand that eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="4.41">going to happen is this whole system is</text>
  <text start="647.98" dur="5.28">going to break down they will not be</text>
  <text start="650.83" dur="5.96">able to keep this continually ongoing we</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="8.94">see it&amp;#39;s crumbling apart right now and</text>
  <text start="656.79" dur="6.88">they will resort to a false flag I mean</text>
  <text start="662.2" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s no other way to look at this at</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="7.53">this point and we&amp;#39;re getting reports now</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="11.9">that Homeland Security they are drafting</text>
  <text start="671.2" dur="10.05">right now plans for a cyber Pearl Harbor</text>
  <text start="678.18" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ve heard warnings about this going</text>
  <text start="681.25" dur="6.089">back a ways of a cyber Pearl Harbor</text>
  <text start="683.25" dur="7.66">where someone will hacker or I mean they</text>
  <text start="687.339" dur="5.731">will hack into the power grid and it</text>
  <text start="690.91" dur="4.08">will bring down the power for a couple</text>
  <text start="693.07" dur="4.98">of weeks</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="6.539">and as I started reporting this the</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="5.849">threat increases each year and they</text>
  <text start="701.529" dur="4.56">continually use cyber attacks on</text>
  <text start="703.899" dur="4.44">different companies to show that look</text>
  <text start="706.089" dur="6.721">how phone will be vulnerable we are at</text>
  <text start="708.339" dur="6.601">any moment we can have an attack last</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="3.63">year the NSA director Michael Rogers</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="4.13">told the House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="716.44" dur="7.91">that cybersecurity was a big concern and</text>
  <text start="719.07" dur="9.73">they&amp;#39;re worried about rogue nations or</text>
  <text start="724.35" dur="10.41">some type of group shutting down the</text>
  <text start="728.8" dur="9">electric hitting the info infrastructure</text>
  <text start="734.76" dur="5.56">now it could be the power it can be the</text>
  <text start="737.8" dur="6.17">power in water it could be the power and</text>
  <text start="740.32" dur="8.97">gas water it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because</text>
  <text start="743.97" dur="7.36">those people their focus is on the</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="4.41">electrical grid because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="751.33" dur="4.91">everything is driven by electric and</text>
  <text start="753.7" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s where the hackers are going to go</text>
  <text start="756.24" dur="5.26">so the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="5.61">identified 16 critical infrastructures</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="4.95">that support the US economy they know</text>
  <text start="764.35" dur="6.51">what they are they knew this a while</text>
