  <text start="68.81" dur="5.76">Cabal destroying records let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="72.68" dur="4.92">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="6.12">geopolitical news now as we know Mueller</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="5.19">is still probing into Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="80.69" dur="5.49">and he&amp;#39;s been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="82.79" dur="7.62">while and so far hasn&amp;#39;t found that much</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="7.65">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="90.41" dur="5.91">Mueller investigative team is looking</text>
  <text start="93.83" dur="4.429">into Tony Podesta and his lobbying firm</text>
  <text start="96.32" dur="4.32">the Podesta group and they&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="5.521">under federal investigation by the FBI</text>
  <text start="100.64" dur="5.46">the Special Counsel Robert Mueller who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.78" dur="4.33">looking at this saying okay what has</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="3.84">happened here and remember the firm</text>
  <text start="108.11" dur="4.649">co-founded by Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign</text>
  <text start="109.94" dur="6.27">manager John Podesta was subpoenaed in</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="5.551">late August and right now we understand</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="3.689">that the Podesta group also earned about</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="3.33">a hundred eighty thousand lobbying for</text>
  <text start="119.899" dur="3.481">the Russian owned mining company uranium</text>
  <text start="121.64" dur="3.24">one during the same period that the</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="3.719">Clinton Foundation were receiving</text>
  <text start="124.88" dur="5.61">millions from the same exact group</text>
  <text start="127.099" dur="7.081">Robert Mueller at this time is looking</text>
  <text start="130.49" dur="6.51">into this now the question is why all of</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="6.41">a sudden is he looking into this is he</text>
  <text start="137" dur="6.06">really looking into this or is the cabal</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="4.259">doing cleanup because remember Robert</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="4.5">Mueller has connections to Clinton</text>
  <text start="144.849" dur="5.86">donated to Clinton most of the people on</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="7.95">his team at part of the Clinton team and</text>
  <text start="150.709" dur="7.021">we see right now that at this point the</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="3.839">Cabal they&amp;#39;re in a tough spot</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="3.06">now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="3.031">they think they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="2.76">still running the show well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="3.51">running parts of the show but not</text>
  <text start="163.55" dur="4.019">everything that looks like their power</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="3.9">is shrinking look at the Middle East</text>
  <text start="167.569" dur="3.571">right now they&amp;#39;re having a huge amount</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="2.88">of trouble now I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="3.69">are out there saying well we&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="3.87">forces to Afghanistan something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.83" dur="3.239">happening in Syria we&amp;#39;re expecting you</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="3">know hundreds of thousands of troops</text>
  <text start="178.069" dur="4.231">going in there and that of course never</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.02">happened what we see in Syria is that</text>
  <text start="182.3" dur="3.09">the Islamic state the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re almost finished the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="185.39" dur="5.37">people who had the referendum that</text>
  <text start="187.52" dur="5.42">going nowhere and pretty soon the United</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="5.49">States is going to be asked to leave</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="6.52">Syria Iraq and the rest of the countries</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="6.6">so is Mueller in there telling everyone</text>
  <text start="199.46" dur="6">that they are investigating all of this</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="7.29">are they really cleaning up certain</text>
  <text start="205.46" dur="7.53">records is this a mop-up operation now</text>
  <text start="210.14" dur="5.42">when you lose power and you understand</text>
  <text start="212.99" dur="6.51">that you&amp;#39;re losing power what happens</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="6.16">you need to clean up all documentation</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.8">of what has happened in the past you</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="4.86">have to destroy the evidence I mean we</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.68">have the emails we have the connection</text>
  <text start="226.58" dur="5.31">to the Podesta group we have the deal</text>
  <text start="228.98" dur="5.04">that Obama and Clinton made with Russia</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="4.8">with the uranium deal they made a lot of</text>
  <text start="234.02" dur="5.64">money off of this so when things start</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="5.79">to go south you need to start to hide</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="4.59">and destroy the information who is in</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="4.47">the inside right now</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="4.92">that is able to do this with absolutely</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="3.18">no problem because of course he can come</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="3.45">out and say this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="5.01">investigating and they can take certain</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="4.679">documentation and destroy it and it</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="5.79">looks like this might be what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="5.791">happening right now now out in Catalonia</text>
  <text start="260.93" dur="4.68">we can see that things are really</text>
  <text start="263.09" dur="5.79">heating up right now Madrid gave</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="5.76">Catalonia an ultimatum and the Catalan</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="4.05">Parliament said listen we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="271.37" dur="4.71">to follow this we see that you enacted</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.83">the article 155 and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.08" dur="4.02">gonna have to take action at this point</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="3.69">and the people are not sitting back</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re not saying oh we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="5.25">go along with this they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="282.89" dur="7.68">we want independence we had a referendum</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="5.88">it was grassroots free and open and this</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="3.72">is what we want to do now of course the</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="3.839">European Commission said it supports</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="3.51">Madrid&amp;#39;s decision to invoke these</text>
  <text start="296.419" dur="2.941">special constitutional powers to</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.71">dissolve the government of Catalonia and</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="6.39">force a new election because the</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="7.32">European Commission the United States</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="6.06">those central banking systems they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="3.6">want this to break apart because it</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="5.01">would be a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.53">for this Spanish economy and they know</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="3.03">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.36">keep everything together we see out in</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="4.65">the Philippines</text>
  <text start="321.32" dur="7.17">Duterte has done it he has destroyed the</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="6.72">Islamic state and he has won which means</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="4.95">the Cabal has just lost more ground</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="5.22">remembered their dirty right now he is</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="5.25">now shifting and pivoting towards Russia</text>
  <text start="336.44" dur="4.76">he&amp;#39;s receiving weapons we have Russian</text>
  <text start="338.69" dur="5.76">ships docking in the Philippines and</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="5.71">right now President duterte has already</text>
  <text start="344.45" dur="4.86">accomplished more in just in just over</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="4.8">one year in office than most of his</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.58">predecessors had done in full</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="5.49">presidential terms and this is just</text>
  <text start="354.89" dur="4.98">amazing the Philippine economy continues</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="4.23">to grow safety and prosperity are</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="6.72">rapidly becoming the primary themes of</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="7.35">the dirty Error and he is making huge</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="5.82">gains and the people love him there and</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="6.66">he&amp;#39;s doing what he says he&amp;#39;s following</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="4.91">everything he says with action which we</text>
  <text start="375.44" dur="5.34">need here in the United States we need</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="5.35">action at this point now we see Rex</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="3.54">Tillerson the new Secretary of State he</text>
  <text start="382.67" dur="3.27">visited he made the secret visit to</text>
  <text start="384.32" dur="4.02">Afghanistan now we know that there are</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="4.83">more troops going into Afghanistan but I</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="4.41">think this is a little different than</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="4.98">when Obama was sending troops in there</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="6.15">or when Bush was sending troops into</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="6">there this time I think the troops are</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="5.61">being sent in for a purpose of going</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="6.27">after these paid mercenary troops just</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="5.25">like out in Syria and the reason why I</text>
  <text start="408.02" dur="4.41">say this is because Tillerson says</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="7.83">something very very interesting he said</text>
  <text start="412.43" dur="8.1">that the Taliban can now be included in</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="6.09">the government talks or even included in</text>
  <text start="420.53" dur="7.83">the government in Afghanistan now this</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="7.44">is a huge 180-degree turn then what was</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="4.8">being said before when the Taliban was</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="3.6">considered a terrorist which terrorist</text>
  <text start="433.16" dur="3.54">organization which they still are but</text>
  <text start="434.72" dur="4.02">now they can be included in the</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="6.84">government in Afghanistan or in the</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="8.34">talks of peace and government and things</text>
  <text start="443.54" dur="6.42">like that this is a huge turning point</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="6.18">at this time and what this means is is</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="5.16">that something else is going on in</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="4.409">Afghanistan we know that Russia and</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="4.32">China are there they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="4.321">agenda in Russia and trying to have</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="4.77">peace there and we can see that with</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="3.69">Tillerson with trump and i believe</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re playing good cop bad cop right</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="3.69">now and I know everyone thinking you</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="3.6">know everything else is happening which</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="3.06">is the opposite of what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="3.93">on because I think things are happening</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="3.75">behind the scenes that we are really</text>
  <text start="474.86" dur="3.15">seeing because the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="3.75">out there just talking about war with</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="4.74">North Korea troops going out to</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="3.93">Afghanistan it&amp;#39;s business as usual which</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="3.33">I think the opposite is happening</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="4.23">because if it is business as usual then</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="4.47">we would have seen a hundred twenty</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="4.35">thousand troops or whatever going into</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="5.16">Syria the Islamic state would have</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="5.22">expanded inside of Syria we see the</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="4.16">opposite happening there we see the</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="6.479">opposite happening now in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="7.09">where all of a sudden now the Taliban</text>
  <text start="504.139" dur="6.291">they may sit at the negotiation table if</text>
  <text start="506.96" dur="6.269">they break off their ties with Terrace</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="4.63">cease their armed struggle and affirm</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="5.821">their respect for the Afghan</text>
  <text start="515.06" dur="6.419">Constitution so they can sit there they</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="4.56">can negotiate they can work with the new</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="5.701">government if they separate themselves</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.37">from the terrorist groups now of course</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="3.93">our were they really part of the</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="5.49">terrorist groups I don&amp;#39;t think so I</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="4.86">think this was played up over time and I</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="3.69">think at this point they&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="3.6">come out and say okay hey we&amp;#39;re not part</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="3.45">of this terrorist groups we&amp;#39;d like to be</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="4.56">included with the negotiations and this</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="4.77">is a huge change out in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="544.13" dur="4.14">where we&amp;#39;re gonna have two sides talking</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="4.05">to each other this is what China and</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="4.439">Russia have been trying to do for a very</text>
  <text start="550.43" dur="4.26">long time well you also see Tillerson</text>
  <text start="552.709" dur="5.551">well he made a stop in Iraq now remember</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="7.769">he was out there telling the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="6.42">government to remove the errata the Iran</text>
  <text start="562.459" dur="4.831">militias because they&amp;#39;re designated as</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="3.42">terrorists now I think he did this on</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="3.33">purpose</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="5.91">and the reason for this is he came out</text>
  <text start="570.62" dur="5.76">and said listen yes Iran their militias</text>
  <text start="574.01" dur="4.56">their Armed Forces they are terrorists</text>
  <text start="576.38" dur="4.079">you should remove them the reason why I</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="4.32">think he went out and said this in</text>
  <text start="580.459" dur="5.641">public is because he wanted the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="582.89" dur="6.34">government to speak up and say that the</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="6.49">US has no right to tell another</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="3.92">what to do and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="592.59" dur="3.87">happened</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="5.02">embodies office responded sharply no</text>
  <text start="596.46" dur="4.98">party has the right to interfere in</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="3.75">Iraqi matters and they&amp;#39;re absolutely</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="3.09">right</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="5.79">the United States government can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="604.53" dur="5.82">another government what to do if Iraq</text>
  <text start="607.71" dur="6.57">wants to keep the Iranian militias in</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="6.66">their country they can do this and the</text>
  <text start="614.28" dur="4.98">United States can&amp;#39;t tell him can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="617.01" dur="2.91">anything and I think he did this on</text>
  <text start="619.26" dur="2.34">purpose</text>
  <text start="619.92" dur="4.98">to show the world that the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="6.66">government is deciding to do this that</text>
  <text start="624.9" dur="4.64">the United States has no control in this</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="3.69">area anymore</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="5.23">we see for the first time in 26 years</text>
  <text start="631.95" dur="6.51">the US has put nuclear bombers on</text>
  <text start="634.77" dur="6.81">24-hour alert and these are the b-52</text>
  <text start="638.46" dur="5.88">bombers and this status has not been</text>
  <text start="641.58" dur="4.92">seen since the Cold War ended in 1991</text>
  <text start="644.34" dur="4.17">now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean we&amp;#39;re going to war</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="3.84">it just means that they put it on high</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="4.08">alert because they think something is</text>
  <text start="650.34" dur="5.07">going to happen there&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="4.26">type of an event now there might be one</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="3.03">maybe they&amp;#39;re getting word that yes the</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="3.93">Cabal is going to try to do something</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="5.19">this is why they&amp;#39;re having the Bombers</text>
  <text start="660.78" dur="6.06">on alert and ready to go or it might be</text>
  <text start="663.63" dur="7.53">a ploy right now to keep the corporate</text>

  <text start="692.16" dur="4.82">anymore with all of this and we can see</text>
  <text start="694.47" dur="5.04">out in Syria I mean the percentage of</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="5.74">land that the Islamic state owns or</text>

  <text start="709.71" dur="3.72">gonna say listen there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>

  <text start="722.28" dur="1.8">you to leave</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="4.26">the only reason the United States said</text>
  <text start="724.08" dur="5.94">they were in Syria was to help fight</text>
  <text start="727.05" dur="5">terrorism and if terrorism is completely</text>
  <text start="730.02" dur="6">eradicated guess what</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="6.76">game over we see right now the US</text>
  <text start="736.02" dur="6.06">government has issued a warning about an</text>
  <text start="738.81" dur="5.1">ongoing cyber attack targeting critical</text>
  <text start="742.08" dur="4.01">national infrastructure saying some</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="5.13">networks and at least one power</text>
  <text start="746.09" dur="5.62">generator have been compromised</text>
  <text start="749.04" dur="4.23">now this report was issued by the US</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="3.78">Department of Homeland Security and the</text>
  <text start="753.27" dur="5.36">Federal Bureau of Investigation and</text>
  <text start="755.49" dur="5.64">Akane&amp;#39;s indicators of compromised and</text>
  <text start="758.63" dur="6.19">technical details on the tactics</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="6.72">techniques and procedures these actors</text>
  <text start="764.82" dur="6.39">used now once again they&amp;#39;re not naming</text>
  <text start="767.85" dur="6.33">names they also indicate the dragonfly</text>
  <text start="771.21" dur="4.35">hacking group was also involved and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="774.18" dur="3.6">sure that this is going to be pointed</text>
  <text start="775.56" dur="3.99">towards North Korea Russia and many</text>
  <text start="777.78" dur="4.32">others and what it looks like to me is</text>
  <text start="779.55" dur="4.83">that they&amp;#39;re building this up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="4.95">putting out these reports they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="784.38" dur="6.69">that North Korea is actually doing all</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="6.54">these things and the threat indicator</text>
  <text start="791.07" dur="4.32">has just gone up and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="3.69">very nervous about all this now remember</text>
  <text start="795.39" dur="3.51">the Pentagon also put out that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.28" dur="4.2">very worried about Wall Street with the</text>
  <text start="798.9" dur="4.83">stock market where this could you know</text>
  <text start="801.48" dur="4.17">this could be hid and the stock market</text>
  <text start="803.73" dur="4.07">could come down so we&amp;#39;re getting these</text>
  <text start="805.65" dur="4.56">stories from all different departments</text>
  <text start="807.8" dur="5.62">telling us that something is headed our</text>
  <text start="810.21" dur="7.95">way why are they telling us all of this</text>
  <text start="813.42" dur="6.75">now because once again this economic</text>
  <text start="818.16" dur="4.92">system that we are in which was created</text>
  <text start="820.17" dur="6">by the central banking system only lasts</text>
  <text start="823.08" dur="4.14">40 to 45 years maybe they can push it a</text>
  <text start="826.17" dur="2.91">little bit further like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="4.62">saying but eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="829.08" dur="6">their system falls apart because you</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="9.21">can&amp;#39;t continually create currency and</text>
  <text start="835.08" dur="8.43">spread debt forever it doesn&amp;#39;t work I</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t care if you have a printing press</text>
  <text start="843.51" dur="5.82">it makes no difference because what</text>
  <text start="846.45" dur="5.67">happens is the people who are supporting</text>
  <text start="849.33" dur="5.64">this debt they can&amp;#39;t support it anymore</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="4.42">the tax revenue that comes in can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="854.97" dur="3.01">support it anymore</text>
  <text start="856.54" dur="4.29">when people start losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="857.98" dur="6">because of austerity because there are</text>
  <text start="860.83" dur="4.65">no jobs the tax revenues go down and the</text>
  <text start="863.98" dur="4.11">debt can&amp;#39;t be supported so you have to</text>
  <text start="865.48" dur="5.22">take on more debt it&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="868.09" dur="4.47">cannot be sustained over a long period</text>
  <text start="870.7" dur="4.56">of time and they know this this is why</text>
  <text start="872.56" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve been prepping for quite a while</text>
  <text start="875.26" dur="5.88">to move everything to a brand new system</text>
  <text start="878.44" dur="6.03">and this is what they&amp;#39;re ready to do all</text>
  <text start="881.14" dur="4.86">they need is some type of an event it</text>
  <text start="884.47" dur="4.23">looks like they&amp;#39;re building up to this</text>
  <text start="886" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re preparing for this and we can</text>
  <text start="888.7" dur="6.27">see that it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time</text>
  <text start="890.62" dur="6.36">before this event hits because if they</text>
  <text start="894.97" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t get the event off the ground guess</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="5.01">what everyone will point their fingers</text>
  <text start="899.56" dur="5.37">at the central banking system because</text>
  <text start="901.99" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re in control of the economies of</text>
  <text start="904.93" dur="7.74">the world if Greece goes down if Spain</text>
  <text start="909.07" dur="7.14">goes down if UK goes down if Canada goes</text>
  <text start="912.67" dur="7.74">down if United States goes down who do</text>
  <text start="916.21" dur="7.71">you blame you blame the Fed the IMF the</text>
  <text start="920.41" dur="6.24">ECB because they&amp;#39;re the ones who were in</text>
  <text start="923.92" dur="6.57">control of all of this and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.65" dur="6.63">want to be blamed why because the</text>
  <text start="930.49" dur="5.31">central banking individuals they want to</text>
  <text start="933.28" dur="4.92">restart the entire system and start this</text>
  <text start="935.8" dur="4.56">whole thing all over again remember this</text>
  <text start="938.2" dur="5.43">will lead all the way up to the biz so</text>
  <text start="940.36" dur="4.71">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now of</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="2.64">course the biz is out there saying that</text>

  <text start="953.53" dur="4.41">might enter a global financial crisis</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="3.66">the IMF is putting out a report because</text>
  <text start="957.94" dur="3.3">these are the high-level central bankers</text>
  <text start="959.53" dur="3.66">these low-level central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.24" dur="4.68">gonna be destroyed in the process but</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="4.86">the high-level central banking systems</text>
  <text start="965.92" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re gonna continue on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="968.05" dur="5.46">already prepared and ready to move to a</text>
  <text start="971.53" dur="6.45">different location they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="973.51" dur="5.97">people they have no allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="977.98" dur="2.01">country or group they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="979.48" dur="3.96">that stuff</text>
  <text start="979.99" dur="6.15">all they care about is their debt model</text>
  <text start="983.44" dur="5.31">and how they have to restart it reset</text>
  <text start="986.14" dur="4.17">the entire system because they know once</text>
