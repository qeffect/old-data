  <text start="124.89" dur="3.21">of cryptocurrency</text>

  <text start="165.06" dur="5.16">regulate the market and provide an even</text>
  <text start="167.549" dur="4.741">playing field for Bitcoin exchanges now</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="3.45">we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of crypto</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="4.44">currencies out there I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="7.74">like 750 or so and this reminds me of</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="7.89">the dot-com era when there were a huge</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="4.71">number of dot-com websites that were</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="2.74">just popping up all over the place and I</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="5.55">remember one there</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="8.37">very very well it was a pet type of</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="6.28">website where they sold dog food and did</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="4.68">you know investors were just piling in</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="5.25">they were spending a lot of money on</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="4.83">this website and they had a lot of</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="4.14">venture capitalists pouring money into</text>
  <text start="205.24" dur="4.53">it and the thing they didn&amp;#39;t realize was</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="5.1">that dogs were very heavy and the</text>
  <text start="209.77" dur="6.33">shipping costs they were expensive and</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="4.71">that company completely failed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="4.14">going to see a lot of these</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="6.78">cryptocurrencies completely fail and</text>
  <text start="220.24" dur="6.69">there will be those that managed to rise</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="6.75">to the top and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="8.04">banks are most worried about now there</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="8.22">was a central banker symposium and the</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="6.21">Bundesbank was there and there was this</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.53">whole form called frontiers in central</text>
  <text start="241.18" dur="6.42">banking past present and future</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="5.91">and within this it contains a battle</text>
  <text start="247.6" dur="4.38">plan and you&amp;#39;re saying yourself well</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="6.59">what is this battle plan this battle</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="7.95">plan is to control the crypto market or</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="6.88">maybe destroy the crypto market because</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="5.7">the question amongst the central bankers</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.85">is what happens if we can make them all</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="6.599">fail then no one will be looking at the</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="7.02">crypto market at all which tells me that</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="5.911">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="4.47">about the crypto market they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="6.779">worried because it takes control away</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="7.47">from them and again if the crypto market</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="4.921">grows it&amp;#39;s decentralized there&amp;#39;s no one</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.47">central bank that controls everything</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="4.47">you get rid of fractional reserve</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="6.3">lending you don&amp;#39;t even need banks at all</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="6.39">if this does happen well their days are</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="4.74">numbered they know this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="4.11">looking at this situation saying what</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="4.86">happens if we can bring down the crypto</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="6.419">market and maybe create our own now</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="7.83">today money the currency that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="6.841">using it is digital but the cryptos add</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="5.14">another layer where it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="6.01">and it&amp;#39;s throughout the world</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.76">on different systems where it does many</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="4.649">many different checks and we can see</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="5.28">that the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="5.881">nervous about this technology now they</text>
  <text start="332" dur="5.009">created something their own called</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="4.38">ripple and it looks like they might be</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="5.551">trying to create their own where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="5.13">going to be using this instead of the</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="6.24">currency that we&amp;#39;re using today</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="7.04">and what came out of the symposium and</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="4.799">this is coming from dr. Jens Weidmann</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="4.15">president of the Deutsche Bundesbank</text>
  <text start="353.599" dur="2.311">and chairman of the board of directors</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="3.75">of the Bank for International</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="4.92">Settlements gave a speech outlining some</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="4.079">ideas on how to best address the</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.22">challenges that cryptocurrencies pose to</text>
  <text start="363.139" dur="5.941">central bank&amp;#39;s policy intervention may</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="5.64">be required not to address a crisis but</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="4.61">to address technology which really means</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="4.44">they need to address this crisis</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="3.97">digitalization has the potential to</text>
  <text start="376.13" dur="5.3">provide financial benefits to the</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="7.259">economy with risk however of</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="5.979">disintermediating central banks as such</text>
  <text start="384.919" dur="3.93">the ability of central banks to conduct</text>
  <text start="387.409" dur="3.861">monetary policy diminishes</text>
  <text start="388.849" dur="5.221">proportionally to the increase of</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="5.679">digitalization so what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="394.07" dur="5.219">here is they&amp;#39;re nervous and afraid about</text>
  <text start="396.949" dur="4.921">this and if they&amp;#39;re nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="5.641">about this this is something that we</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="4.769">should all look at because it tells us</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="4.829">that this is something outside of their</text>
  <text start="406.639" dur="5.34">control now I remember when Trump was</text>
  <text start="409.759" dur="4.621">first being inaugurated and he was</text>
  <text start="411.979" dur="3.361">campaigning and the first couple of</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="2.43">weeks he said he was going to be</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="4.62">bringing back all these jobs</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="5.82">manufacturing jobs and he was basically</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="4.26">applauding himself and people were</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="3.18">saying wow look at all this and back</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="4.979">then I said these are just announcements</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="5.97">it sounds great in the newspapers sounds</text>
  <text start="429.199" dur="5.671">great online sounds great on his Twitter</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="5.759">feed but in reality these corporations</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="5.039">are not going to do this in this economy</text>
  <text start="437.539" dur="5.31">it makes no business sense for them to</text>
  <text start="439.909" dur="4.921">do this now Ford they said they were</text>
  <text start="442.849" dur="4.081">going to scrap their Mexico plan and</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="5.07">they were going to invest in Michigan</text>
  <text start="446.93" dur="4.83">and it looks like well they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="3.569">to be doing this they&amp;#39;re not even going</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="2.58">to be building in Mexico they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="453.469" dur="3.571">straight to</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="5.19">China now the company&amp;#39;s new CEO Jim</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="4.77">Hackett he says he&amp;#39;s going to relocate</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="4.35">the company&amp;#39;s focus production to China</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="4.169">but don&amp;#39;t worry if not going to affect</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="4.86">the jobs in the United States when have</text>
  <text start="465.979" dur="6.091">we heard this before it always affects</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="6.63">the jobs in the United States and the</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="5.67">reason for this is because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="3.75">cost-effective to be here in the United</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="3.57">States with all the regulations and</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="5.34">everything else because labor is much</text>
  <text start="481.31" dur="5.76">much cheaper in other areas what needs</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="4.89">to be done is we need to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="5.37">system that were in where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.35" dur="5.22">destroying everything that we are</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.59">looking at in the United States all</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="4.68">these regulations the central banks</text>
  <text start="497.03" dur="6.51">everything everything they&amp;#39;ve done has</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="6.75">destroyed America and now it is time to</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="4.89">get rid of them and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="506" dur="5.25">destroyed the manufacturing area it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.65">destroyed States and people&amp;#39;s lives I</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="3.69">mean in Illinois we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="3.63">before they&amp;#39;re in crisis mode right now</text>
  <text start="514.94" dur="4.529">and they&amp;#39;re saying this is not a false</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="4.53">alarm right now the state can no longer</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="5.191">function without a responsible and</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="6.3">complete budget and if they don&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="6.54">their fiscal house in order it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="527.54" dur="5.25">to be too late and basically what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="4.68">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re reaching</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="5.94">that point where the state can no longer</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="4.8">function and this is not going to be the</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="5.58">only state it&amp;#39;s going to have a ripple</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="4.59">effect across other states and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="3.81">not going to be able to function</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="7.13">basically the system is breaking down</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="7.26">right now and if we go back in time and</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="5.35">maybe three three and a half years ago</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="5.16">when we started talking about housing</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="5.88">how things are starting to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="6.6">we pointed certain things out how the</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="5.399">housing market was pumped up by pumping</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="4.62">up the bubbles with investment firms</text>
  <text start="569.029" dur="5.971">hedge funds and others to purchase the</text>
  <text start="571.76" dur="6.54">homes and hold on to them rent them if</text>
  <text start="575" dur="5.459">they can keep housing off the market so</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="4.77">prices continually rise we even looked</text>
  <text start="580.459" dur="3.87">at the retail market where retail stores</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="2.61">were having a lot of trouble and back</text>
  <text start="584.329" dur="3.421">then people saying what&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="5.31">Amazon it&amp;#39;s because of online</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="5.01">sales and we&amp;#39;ve proven that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="590.99" dur="5.79">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="592.76" dur="6.57">the online market is only 8% of retail</text>
  <text start="596.78" dur="4.17">and what we were looking at and we saw a</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="4.01">couple of stores go out of business and</text>
  <text start="600.95" dur="5.58">a couple stores closed down and we</text>
  <text start="603.34" dur="5.02">looked deep deep deep into what was</text>
  <text start="606.53" dur="4.11">happening in retail and here we are</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="5.91">today where it is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="610.64" dur="6.24">the entire system is breaking down now</text>
  <text start="614.27" dur="3.99">the housing market is breaking down now</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s very interesting I look around</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="4.92">the country and I see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="621.26" dur="4.26">putting their homes up for sale because</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="5.07">this is what happens at the end of a</text>
  <text start="625.52" dur="5.67">bubble cycle people think this is the</text>
  <text start="628.25" dur="5.49">best time to sell their homes so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="631.19" dur="4.47">going to see a lot of people put their</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="4.95">houses up for sale you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="4.73">for sale for sale for sale all the way</text>
  <text start="638.69" dur="4.08">down the street we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="640.39" dur="4.69">because they&amp;#39;re trying to get out and</text>
  <text start="642.77" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re trying to get the full market</text>
  <text start="645.08" dur="4.95">price for their home and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.21" dur="5.73">happening is the traffic is drying up at</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="6.54">this time but we still see a little bump</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="6.66">in existing home sales very small 1.1</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="5.73">percent and what we&amp;#39;ve seen over time is</text>
  <text start="659.6" dur="4.68">that housing has really not gone</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="3.81">anywhere it&amp;#39;s gone up it&amp;#39;s gone way down</text>
  <text start="664.28" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s gone up a little bit and we have to</text>
  <text start="666.11" dur="5.58">remember why because hedge funds</text>
  <text start="668.9" dur="5.61">investment companies they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="671.69" dur="5.58">buying new home construction they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="674.51" dur="6.78">there purchasing existing homes and</text>

  <text start="717.68" dur="3.86">in some cases it looks like it&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="725.74" dur="7.08">tried to stop this and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="729.339" dur="5.641">is that China&amp;#39;s bond yield curve well it</text>
  <text start="732.82" dur="5.16">remains inverted and this is the longest</text>
  <text start="734.98" dur="5.13">in history this is the tenth day in a</text>

  <text start="740.11" dur="4.5">authorities they&amp;#39;ve reached their max</text>
  <text start="741.639" dur="5.01">pain point and what they tried to do is</text>
  <text start="744.61" dur="4.469">they try to buy one point two six</text>

  <text start="752.44" dur="5.69">happening and it really didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="756.399" dur="5.221">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="758.13" dur="6.459">yields are tumbling the rescue attempt</text>
  <text start="761.62" dur="6.57">did not work there the curve remains</text>
  <text start="764.589" dur="6.601">inverted and this is a disastrous</text>
  <text start="768.19" dur="5.79">scenario right now and where we are</text>
  <text start="771.19" dur="4.079">headed we are headed into a collapsing</text>
  <text start="773.98" dur="4.169">area now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="775.269" dur="5.671">all this this collapse is going to occur</text>
  <text start="778.149" dur="4.831">in two stages the first stage now they</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="4.11">can&amp;#39;t blame everything on Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.98" dur="5.88">going to be completely impossible maybe</text>
  <text start="785.05" dur="7.229">in the fall maybe next year but he</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="6.479">didn&amp;#39;t put any type of economic policy</text>
  <text start="792.279" dur="6.271">in place right now he hasn&amp;#39;t really done</text>
  <text start="795.339" dur="4.921">anything yes he promised a lot of jobs a</text>
  <text start="798.55" dur="3.93">lot of manufacturing but what&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="800.26" dur="5.699">economic policy what to bring jobs back</text>
  <text start="802.48" dur="5.609">to the US that&amp;#39;s not really a policy he</text>
  <text start="805.959" dur="5.06">hasn&amp;#39;t really done anything what they</text>
  <text start="808.089" dur="5.701">can do is they can blame the first</text>
  <text start="811.019" dur="5.231">portion of the collapse on Trump and</text>
  <text start="813.79" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see signs that</text>
  <text start="816.25" dur="4.019">as we seen a little bit of this in the</text>
  <text start="818.38" dur="5.209">corporate media and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="820.269" dur="7.471">see that they&amp;#39;re making these strange</text>
  <text start="823.589" dur="6.94">connections in what Trump has been doing</text>
  <text start="827.74" dur="5.969">with immigration and other things now</text>
  <text start="830.529" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re blaming Trump for the slumping</text>
  <text start="833.709" dur="4.651">gasoline demand because illegal</text>
  <text start="836.589" dur="4.381">immigrants they&amp;#39;re afraid to leave their</text>
  <text start="838.36" dur="5.279">homes so they&amp;#39;re not driving anywhere</text>
  <text start="840.97" dur="6.049">and they&amp;#39;re saying this is the major</text>
  <text start="843.639" dur="6.601">problem now this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="847.019" dur="5.111">ridiculous and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="850.24" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re trying to come up with some way</text>
  <text start="852.13" dur="5.1">somehow to say</text>
  <text start="853.84" dur="6.9">that yes it is because of Trump and this</text>
  <text start="857.23" dur="6.12">is the major problem now the demand for</text>
  <text start="860.74" dur="5.55">gas is because a lot less people are</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="5.55">working a lot less people are traveling</text>
  <text start="866.29" dur="5.19">a lot less people have automobiles</text>
  <text start="868.9" dur="3.87">because they can&amp;#39;t afford them and from</text>
  <text start="871.48" dur="3.9">everything that&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="872.77" dur="5.73">economy you&amp;#39;re going to see less demand</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="4.65">for fuel especially if people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="878.5" dur="4.2">going to the brick-and-mortar stores to</text>
  <text start="880.03" dur="4.68">go shopping which we are now seeing and</text>
  <text start="882.7" dur="4.29">if a lot people a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="4.08">getting laid off they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="886.99" dur="4.26">work if a lot more people are working</text>
  <text start="888.79" dur="4.71">from home let&amp;#39;s say because the office</text>
  <text start="891.25" dur="4.71">says ok we&amp;#39;ll pay you less to work from</text>
  <text start="893.5" dur="4.35">home they&amp;#39;re not using their cars so</text>
  <text start="895.96" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s not because of the illegal</text>
  <text start="897.85" dur="2.85">immigrants but they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="899.02" dur="3.59">this connection and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="900.7" dur="6.75">make the case of why this is happening</text>
  <text start="902.61" dur="6.4">now oil right now is collapsing and we</text>
  <text start="907.45" dur="4.29">know that Saudi Arabia has been pumping</text>
  <text start="909.01" dur="6.48">out a lot of oil right now and the oil</text>
  <text start="911.74" dur="6.63">collapse well it&amp;#39;s about to trigger a</text>
  <text start="915.49" dur="4.92">crisis in junk bonds and oil has been</text>
  <text start="918.37" dur="4.35">going straight down for weeks now right</text>
  <text start="920.41" dur="6.87">now it&amp;#39;s below 43 dollars a barrel down</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="7.11">16% from levels a month ago so what you</text>
  <text start="927.28" dur="5.37">might ask oil experiences similar drops</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="5.82">all the time why is this important this</text>
  <text start="932.65" dur="5.94">is important because the high yield or</text>
  <text start="935.65" dur="6.3">junk bond market is closely associated</text>
  <text start="938.59" dur="5.49">with the oil prices and if oil continues</text>
  <text start="941.95" dur="4.62">to collapse we&amp;#39;re going to start seeing</text>
  <text start="944.08" dur="5.55">some serious contagion risks in the</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="5.16">high-yield credit and you know what</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="5.97">asset class tracks high-yield credit or</text>
  <text start="951.73" dur="7.26">junk bonds stocks and every time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="955.6" dur="7.08">seen oil drop like this it signals a</text>
  <text start="958.99" dur="6.63">recession now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="5.76">economic indicators pointing to a</text>
  <text start="965.62" dur="4.77">recession we&amp;#39;re already in a recession</text>
  <text start="968.44" dur="3.96">and I&amp;#39;m already saying that we are in</text>
  <text start="970.39" dur="4.14">this recession we&amp;#39;re in this deep</text>
  <text start="972.4" dur="3.6">recession because a lot of the economic</text>
  <text start="974.53" dur="4.41">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="976" dur="6.29">are a lot worse than they were in 2008</text>
  <text start="978.94" dur="6.99">we are getting very very close to that</text>
  <text start="982.29" dur="4.96">scenario where the central bank is going</text>
  <text start="985.93" dur="3">to pull the plug</text>
  <text start="987.25" dur="3.06">and of course they&amp;#39;re going to make it</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="2.85">look like they have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="990.31" dur="3.03">the collapse of course because they want</text>
  <text start="991.78" dur="2.91">to control the narrative and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="993.34" dur="2.88">going to point the finger someplace else</text>
  <text start="994.69" dur="4.44">and this is why I&amp;#39;ve been saying that</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="5.22">this is going to be a two stage type of</text>
  <text start="999.13" dur="3.9">collapse if they have their way now</text>
  <text start="1001.44" dur="5.73">remember there&amp;#39;s many different plans</text>
  <text start="1003.03" dur="5.97">being pushed out there we have the plan</text>
  <text start="1007.17" dur="4.44">by the central bank the plan by Trump</text>
  <text start="1009" dur="5.94">and everyone is trying to get their</text>
  <text start="1011.61" dur="6.72">narrative and hold on to their narrative</text>
  <text start="1014.94" dur="5.88">as the system comes down and the central</text>
  <text start="1018.33" dur="4.11">bank right now it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1020.82" dur="5.369">prepared along with the deep state it</text>
  <text start="1022.44" dur="8.97">looks like they&amp;#39;re preparing to collapse</text>
  <text start="1026.189" dur="6.301">the economy and bring us to a war and of</text>
  <text start="1031.41" dur="3.08">course this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1032.49" dur="4.17">planning all along this is nothing new</text>
  <text start="1034.49" dur="4.9">we&amp;#39;ve been discussing this for a very</text>
  <text start="1036.66" dur="5.31">long time and it looks like all this</text>
  <text start="1039.39" dur="4.92">Russian collusion and all this Russians</text>
  <text start="1041.97" dur="3.479">hacking the election system well we can</text>
  <text start="1044.31" dur="2.639">see that&amp;#39;s all going down the drain</text>
  <text start="1045.449" dur="1.921">right now there&amp;#39;s no case for this</text>
  <text start="1046.949" dur="5.161">anymore</text>
  <text start="1047.37" dur="7.02">so they have no choice but to go full</text>
  <text start="1052.11" dur="5.01">steam ahead go full steam ahead with</text>
  <text start="1054.39" dur="4.65">everything and this is what we see</text>
  <text start="1057.12" dur="6.15">happening right now this is why we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1059.04" dur="8.16">this period of time of complete chaos</text>
  <text start="1063.27" dur="6.63">and it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re building this up and</text>
  <text start="1067.2" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going fast forward with their</text>
  <text start="1069.9" dur="3.63">plan and this is why I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="1071.94" dur="4.26">everyone needs to be ready for this</text>
  <text start="1073.53" dur="4.98">because when it hit it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="1076.2" dur="4.35">very hard it&amp;#39;s not going to be oh look</text>
