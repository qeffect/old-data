  <text start="49.25" dur="5.64">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the x</text>
  <text start="52.58" dur="4.62">22 report my name is Dave and sep assaut</text>
  <text start="54.89" dur="5.01">dhone thousand 201 B and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.2" dur="4.95">februari 10th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="59.9" dur="4.91">the episode is the deep state is now</text>
  <text start="62.15" dur="5.64">formulating a plan for that next event</text>
  <text start="64.81" dur="6.34">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="67.79" dur="7.5">political energy of political news now</text>
  <text start="71.15" dur="6.96">since Obama took office in 2008 we have</text>
  <text start="75.29" dur="7.23">seen a record number of Americans</text>
  <text start="78.11" dur="6.539">renounce their US citizenship the number</text>
  <text start="82.52" dur="6.51">of published expatriates for the fourth</text>
  <text start="84.649" dur="9.72">quarter of 2016 was 2365 bringing the</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="9.18">total number 4 2016 to 5411 setting a</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="7.86">new all-time quarterly and annual record</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="6.72">by comparison the number of expatriates</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="5.821">4 2016 reflects a twenty-six percent</text>
  <text start="104.93" dur="6.9">increase over 2015 and a fifty-eight</text>
  <text start="108.05" dur="6.24">percent increase over 2014 and we can</text>
  <text start="111.83" dur="6.12">see right now that when we look at this</text>
  <text start="114.29" dur="9.03">it really started to shoot up in the</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="9.9">years of 2014 2015 and 2016 and again</text>
  <text start="123.32" dur="8.85">this was before Trump took office this</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="6.84">was when Obama was president now DHS is</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="4.77">out there and they are reporting that</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="4.68">the wall that Trump wants to build is</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="4.26">going to cost about 22 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s going to take about 3.5 years to</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="7.379">build and the fences and walls are going</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="6.78">to be covering about 1,250 miles and at</text>
  <text start="148.579" dur="5.22">this point in time I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="5.25">necessary to build a physical wall</text>
  <text start="153.799" dur="7.53">there&amp;#39;s a lot of electronic devices we</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="6.69">have border patrols and if they just do</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="4.38">their job instead of letting the</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="5.25">illegals in as they jump over the border</text>
  <text start="165.709" dur="5.611">if they just send them back guess what</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="5.43">with all the electronic surveillance</text>
  <text start="171.32" dur="6.27">with the drones and everything else it</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="6.15">is possible to patrol the area I mean</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="5.57">technology is fantastic today so this</text>
  <text start="180.44" dur="7.14">wall might be overkill at this point</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="10.3">we see the Ninth Circuit ruling welp</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="10.26">they decided to not let Trump enact his</text>
  <text start="193.46" dur="6.84">ban there were a three-judge panel that</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="5.13">heard the case Judge William C can be</text>
  <text start="200.3" dur="5.61">jr. he was a jimmy carter appointing</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="5.61">richard r clifton a george w bush</text>
  <text start="205.91" dur="5.28">appointee and michelle Friedland a</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="4.08">Barack Obama appointing now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="5.1">interesting about all this is they</text>
  <text start="212.66" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t even cite the section that Trump</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="4.59">was promoting out or his lawyers were</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="6.15">pointing out where the president has the</text>
  <text start="220.88" dur="7.65">right to stop aliens coming into this</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="6.15">country and Judge Andrew Napolitano was</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="4.89">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="230.63" dur="5.82">statute specifically says the President</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="5.16">on his own by Proclamation meaning he</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t have to consult with anybody</text>
  <text start="238.58" dur="6.36">else to make the decision the decision</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="6.78">to ban is not reviewable judges are</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="6.33">incapable of second-guessing the</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="5.91">President on it for that reason he may</text>
  <text start="251.27" dur="3.72">be thinking that he might take this to</text>
  <text start="253.34" dur="5.16">the Supreme Court which will invalidate</text>
  <text start="254.99" dur="6.12">this but he is saying that the Ninth</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="5.31">Circuit ruling is intellectually</text>
  <text start="261.11" dur="5.25">dishonest and they&amp;#39;re really not looking</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="5.43">at the law right now and by the way the</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="7.23">Ninth Circuit ruling this court this is</text>
  <text start="269.24" dur="8.79">the most overruled court by the Supreme</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="6.81">Court and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="5.55">most likely politically based we know</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="4.77">that there&amp;#39;s powers that are behind the</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="4.8">curtain the deeps 8 the elite the</text>
  <text start="285.17" dur="7.23">central banks and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.7">pushing their agenda forward and this is</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="6.15">exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="5.85">since they have ruled on this the US</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="3.87">State Department has more than doubled</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="5.34">the refugee inflow from seventh</text>
  <text start="302.42" dur="7.35">error-prone countries since robart</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="8.25">decided to block Trump&amp;#39;s immigration</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="5.07">reform and since februari third 1100</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="2.82">refugees have entered the united states</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="1.889">with seventy-seven percent arriving from</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="2.849">the sev</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="5.011">tarapur own countries now we have to</text>
  <text start="319.189" dur="4.47">remember why do we have this problem why</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="2.759">do they pick those countries well this</text>
  <text start="323.659" dur="3.09">is where the United States government</text>
  <text start="324.499" dur="4.5">central bankers went into these</text>
  <text start="326.749" dur="4.021">countries and had regime change and they</text>
  <text start="328.999" dur="5.88">have been in a state of constant more</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="7.109">ever since now the White House is out</text>
  <text start="334.879" dur="7.021">there and they are investigating leaks</text>
  <text start="337.879" dur="7.021">in the White House because there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="6.15">of leaked information coming out and we</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="5.009">can see that there are Obama leftovers</text>
  <text start="348.05" dur="4.38">that are in there that are leaking</text>
  <text start="349.909" dur="4.35">everything that Trump does and feeding</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="4.319">it to the corporate media and right now</text>
  <text start="354.259" dur="4.671">there&amp;#39;s an investigation going on to</text>
  <text start="356.749" dur="4.741">find out who these individuals are and</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="4.9">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="8.039">breaching a lot of the protocols and</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="7.35">laws around leaking information now I</text>
  <text start="369.529" dur="3.63">think what Trump is doing at this point</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="4.62">he knows that there&amp;#39;s leaks and I think</text>
  <text start="373.159" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s purposely letting some of the</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="4.589">executive orders you know leak out and</text>
  <text start="378.319" dur="4.5">never go forward with them like these</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="5.52">draft executive orders other leaks where</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="6.481">he&amp;#39;s having conversations with different</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="4.921">leaders people here what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="4.049">then they tell it right to the corporate</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.889">media and they spin it any way they want</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="4.891">and we can see this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="395.719" dur="6.45">happening because the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="6.78">part of the elite system where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="5.28">going to go after everything the Trump</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="4.379">administration does remember Trump is</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="3.541">really not part of democratic republican</text>
  <text start="409.399" dur="4.55">he&amp;#39;s kind of standing out there on his</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="7.579">own and both of them are coming for him</text>
  <text start="413.949" dur="8.5">with the central bank and the elite now</text>
  <text start="418.569" dur="5.62">we see that there&amp;#39;s a leet briefing</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="4.11">document from political operator David</text>
  <text start="424.189" dur="5.91">Brock&amp;#39;s media matters which is funded by</text>
  <text start="426.559" dur="6.84">George Soros he&amp;#39;s a backer and it looks</text>
  <text start="430.099" dur="6.63">like they have been conspiring with</text>
  <text start="433.399" dur="5.42">Facebook and Google to censor the</text>
  <text start="436.729" dur="5.701">alternative media coming up with ways to</text>
  <text start="438.819" dur="7.481">completely sensor the other media that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="7.8">out there because this way if they can</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="5.37">censor the alternative media it makes it</text>
  <text start="450.23" dur="3.84">to control the flow of information and</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve said this in the past going back</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="4.56">many many many reports before Trump was</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="5.13">even elected where this was their goal</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="8.51">they had the control of creating</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="8.49">currency they had control of the</text>
  <text start="467.14" dur="5.98">corporate media what they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="469.88" dur="6.03">control of was the alternative media on</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="5.79">the internet and they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="5.04">control the alternative media for a very</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="3.96">long time because the alternative media</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="4.83">it is growing and growing and growing</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="4.2">and they don&amp;#39;t like this and what</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now and they</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="3.69">started off with fake news which really</text>
  <text start="488.93" dur="3.45">didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere because it turned out</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="4.71">that a lot of the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="5.46">spinning fake news they&amp;#39;re trying to use</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="3.54">whatever they possibly can to stop the</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="2.94">alternative media and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="499.01" dur="4.44">difficult because they want to be in</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="5.13">control of the propaganda and we can see</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="4.71">right now this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="5.43">push this is why they&amp;#39;re teaming up with</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="6.27">Facebook and Google and all the other</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="6.96">social media outlets to try to control</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.91">what is being said on these platforms</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="3.57">and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re coming up with</text>
  <text start="520.34" dur="4.38">these algorithms and everything else so</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="5.19">what Brock is really trying to do from</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="5.37">media matters he&amp;#39;s attempting to create</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="5.78">a more effective propaganda model if he</text>
  <text start="530.09" dur="5.88">can censor the alternative media and</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="6.4">this is really what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="6.72">now we know George Soros has claws in</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="6.21">many NGOs Media Matters and many groups</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="5.52">that have been creating riots around the</text>
  <text start="545.45" dur="4.68">country and what is it happened right</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="4.02">now is that thousands of American</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="5.13">citizens well they&amp;#39;re demanding that the</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="5.88">White House issue and in an</text>
  <text start="555.26" dur="5.61">international arrest warrant for George</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="4.77">Soros and this is a new petition that</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="4.86">has already gathered about 6,000 plus</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="5.07">signatures and they&amp;#39;re trying to reach</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="4.05">100,000 signatures and this is what they</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="5.7">want to do this is what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="569.78" dur="6">that George Soros has done one</text>
  <text start="573.65" dur="4.35">financially supports open sedition in</text>
  <text start="575.78" dur="3.63">major American cities resulting in</text>
  <text start="578" dur="4.44">millions of dollars of property damage</text>
  <text start="579.41" dur="4.71">as well as loss of life attempts to</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="3.66">manipulate democratic elections by</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="5.18">dating millions of dollars to his</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="5.4">preferred candidates seeks to curtail</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="5.26">American sovereignty in his own words</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="5.25">the main obstacle to a stable and just</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="4.83">world order is the United States</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="5.04">changing attitude and policies of the</text>
  <text start="599.39" dur="5.09">United States remains my top priority</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="5.1">than before is a currency manipulator</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="4.51">Soros initiated a British financial</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="3.99">crisis by dumping 10 billion sterling</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="4.74">forcing the devaluation of the currency</text>
  <text start="610.88" dur="4.89">and gaining a billion dollar profit and</text>
  <text start="613.73" dur="5.1">we can see that this goes even further</text>
  <text start="615.77" dur="5.46">than that Soros funds a lot of the NGOs</text>
  <text start="618.83" dur="5.52">that are around the world which pushes</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="5.549">regime change in many countries so he</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="3.929">destabilizes the entire world he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.779" dur="4.921">looking for that one world government</text>
  <text start="628.279" dur="7.051">and this is his dream and he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="7.079">pushing it all along now we see out in</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="7.41">California the Air Force they tested a</text>
  <text start="638.779" dur="7.381">minute man ICBM and they launched it</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="5.64">from Los Angeles the missile blasted off</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="6">at eleven thirty nine p.m. pacific time</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="7.17">on wednesday from Vandenberg Air Force</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="6.36">Base and the Air Force says the missile</text>
  <text start="655.55" dur="6.78">carried test re-entry vehicles that</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="6.17">headed for a target 4,200 miles away and</text>
  <text start="662.33" dur="5.3">this was shot into the Pacific Ocean</text>
  <text start="664.69" dur="7.53">towards the Marshall Islands which</text>
  <text start="667.63" dur="7.09">looking at it is going towards China and</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="5.2">it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="674.72" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ve done this before where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="4.68">sending a message to trying to look what</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="5.94">we can do we can fire this missile yes</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="7.34">it can reach you and this is all about</text>
  <text start="685.37" dur="6.36">provoking China we saw this happen I</text>
  <text start="689.44" dur="5.769">think was last year or the year before</text>
  <text start="691.73" dur="6.45">where they tested one and we can see</text>
  <text start="695.209" dur="5.421">that the elite the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="698.18" dur="5.58">want this war they need a distraction</text>
  <text start="700.63" dur="6.16">Trump is not going to be enough yes they</text>
  <text start="703.76" dur="5.37">can initially blame it on him but what I</text>
  <text start="706.79" dur="4.68">think is going to happen is that Trump</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="5.16">since he&amp;#39;s in the White House now he has</text>
  <text start="711.47" dur="4.65">access to many many documents and if</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="3.06">they start blaming him on the collapse</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="3.57">and things too rapidly</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="6.09">are falling apart we can see already</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="6.24">they have put in impeachment papers he</text>
  <text start="723.44" dur="4.47">might just spill the beans on all these</text>
  <text start="725.93" dur="3.72">individuals now if he does this this</text>
  <text start="727.91" dur="4.41">would be the largest truth bomb that</text>

  <text start="760.28" dur="4.02">whatever they possibly can to get it</text>
  <text start="761.96" dur="5.22">started because we see out in the South</text>

  <text start="767.18" dur="6.89">declaration after world war two that yes</text>

  <text start="778.7" dur="7.5">US aircraft they fly very very close to</text>
  <text start="782.09" dur="6.27">this area to the south china sea and we</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="5.64">see there&amp;#39;s a report of a close</text>

  <text start="797.24" dur="5.28">the US military planes frequently carry</text>
  <text start="800.15" dur="5.37">out reconnaissance in Chinese coastal</text>

  <text start="820.67" dur="5.76">States is flying the plane very close to</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="5.16">china just like the United States was</text>
  <text start="826.43" dur="4.38">playing flying the planes very close to</text>
  <text start="828.68" dur="5.55">Russia and every time they fly very</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="7.32">close they send up the jet planes they</text>
  <text start="834.23" dur="6.86">inspect and yes this is what they want</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="5.76">to happen this is called provoking</text>
  <text start="841.09" dur="4.93">having China fly close to the planes and</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="4.2">then what happens is the u.s. comes out</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="3.87">and says oh this is unsafe look how</text>
  <text start="848.09" dur="2.999">close I got to us but remember the</text>
  <text start="849.89" dur="5.73">United States is</text>
  <text start="851.089" dur="6.591">flying their planes in their airspace if</text>
  <text start="855.62" dur="6.06">you imagine a China or Russia was flying</text>
  <text start="857.68" dur="7.839">their airplanes off the coast of Florida</text>
  <text start="861.68" dur="6.449">or the off the coast of California what</text>
  <text start="865.519" dur="6.48">would the United States do they would</text>
  <text start="868.129" dur="5.4">send up planes to intercept well this is</text>
  <text start="871.999" dur="3.541">exactly what these countries are doing</text>
  <text start="873.529" dur="4.86">but what&amp;#39;s happening now is the</text>
  <text start="875.54" dur="5.19">corporate media comes out and they</text>
  <text start="878.389" dur="5.101">broadcast this out there to make it seem</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="5.519">like these countries are provoking the</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="4.469">United States this is how it works but</text>
  <text start="886.249" dur="4.31">what&amp;#39;s really happening is the United</text>
  <text start="887.959" dur="5.79">States is flying very close to make sure</text>
  <text start="890.559" dur="7.871">these countries do something so it looks</text>
  <text start="893.749" dur="7.291">that way we see out in Libya Russia and</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="4.98">general ha start they are making deals</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="5.37">right now and it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="6.779">joining up and they had a meeting in</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="6.229">Tobruk and it looks like the UN back</text>
  <text start="910.189" dur="5.31">government well their days are numbered</text>
  <text start="912.639" dur="5.5">because it looks like Russia will be</text>
  <text start="915.499" dur="5.851">supporting general half tar and it looks</text>
  <text start="918.139" dur="5.19">like he&amp;#39;ll be receiving the weapons</text>
  <text start="921.35" dur="5.37">he&amp;#39;ll be receiving what he needs and</text>
  <text start="923.329" dur="6.031">he&amp;#39;s getting the backing and the UN back</text>
  <text start="926.72" dur="5.039">government of national Accord well again</text>
  <text start="929.36" dur="4.079">this was a shell of a government put</text>
  <text start="931.759" dur="4.351">together by the United States the</text>
  <text start="933.439" dur="5.421">coalition forces the UN and the people</text>
  <text start="936.11" dur="6.75">they had no say in this they were</text>
  <text start="938.86" dur="6.459">expected to accept this government which</text>
  <text start="942.86" dur="6.419">is not how democracy works the people</text>
  <text start="945.319" dur="7.07">say who they want they&amp;#39;re not given what</text>
  <text start="949.279" dur="7.56">other governments think they should have</text>
  <text start="952.389" dur="9.581">now russia says that what happened in</text>
  <text start="956.839" dur="8.451">Syria with the turkey incident well it</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="7.469">was a mistake but turkey did give them</text>
  <text start="965.29" dur="6.159">the coordinates of where to bomb and it</text>
  <text start="969.439" dur="3.84">looks like turkey might have messed up</text>
  <text start="971.449" dur="4.56">and when they gave them the coordinates</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="4.321">now turkey they heard the explanation</text>
  <text start="976.009" dur="3.81">from Russia they looked at the</text>
  <text start="977.6" dur="4.469">information and turkey says yes this is</text>
  <text start="979.819" dur="4.591">what happened in this situation and</text>
  <text start="982.069" dur="3.001">we&amp;#39;re very saddened that you know people</text>
  <text start="984.41" dur="5.1">had</text>
  <text start="985.07" dur="6.57">I from this ridiculous mistake we see</text>
  <text start="989.51" dur="7.02">that the war on the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="991.64" dur="6.9">cost the u.s. 11 billion dollars and as</text>
  <text start="996.53" dur="4.38">of January 27 to us and coalition</text>
  <text start="998.54" dur="7.38">warplanes had flown a hundred and</text>
  <text start="1000.91" dur="8.78">thirty-six thousand sorties and they had</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="6.78">17 thousand seven hundred strikes and</text>
  <text start="1009.69" dur="6.82">during this period the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1012.7" dur="8.82">expanded their territory the only reason</text>
  <text start="1016.51" dur="8.64">the Islamic state reduced its territory</text>
  <text start="1021.52" dur="7.11">was because of Russia Russia stepped in</text>
  <text start="1025.15" dur="6.33">and was actually bombing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1028.63" dur="4.949">state and we could see Assad is out</text>
  <text start="1031.48" dur="5.4">there saying that the United States</text>
  <text start="1033.579" dur="5.161">conducts cosmetic military campaign</text>
  <text start="1036.88" dur="6.329">against the Islamic state and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.74" dur="6.99">exactly what it was they were pretending</text>
  <text start="1043.209" dur="3.781">to hit the Islamic state when they were</text>
  <text start="1045.73" dur="3.47">really hitting the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1046.99" dur="5.43">helping the Islamic state by bombing</text>
  <text start="1049.2" dur="8.17">different areas so the Islamic state can</text>
  <text start="1052.42" dur="6.72">take it over Russia came in and the</text>
  <text start="1057.37" dur="4.47">Islamic state started losing ground when</text>
  <text start="1059.14" dur="5.22">they were actually hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1061.84" dur="4.92">state I mean the United States couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1064.36" dur="4.41">even hit the oil convoy they pretended</text>
  <text start="1066.76" dur="4.32">like it didn&amp;#39;t exist it until Russia</text>
  <text start="1068.77" dur="5.37">pointed out you can&amp;#39;t see this it&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="1071.08" dur="4.77">it goes right into Turkey we have drone</text>
  <text start="1074.14" dur="3.99">footage we have satellite imagery and</text>
  <text start="1075.85" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re going to bomb it now the United</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="3.21">States says oh yes we see a too and they</text>
  <text start="1080.17" dur="3">started bombing it but they drop</text>
  <text start="1081.34" dur="4.11">leaflets to let the drivers out the</text>
  <text start="1083.17" dur="3.69">Islamic state drivers out and warn them</text>
  <text start="1085.45" dur="4.44">ahead of time that they were going to</text>
  <text start="1086.86" dur="6.51">bomb where Russia said no we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1089.89" dur="5.49">taking them out so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="5.25">the United States government the</text>
  <text start="1095.38" dur="6.75">coalition forces they support the</text>
  <text start="1098.62" dur="5.73">terrorist groups now this entire story</text>
  <text start="1102.13" dur="5.43">about amnesty international with these</text>
  <text start="1104.35" dur="6.48">hangings and stuff this was a PSYOP that</text>
  <text start="1107.56" dur="7.85">was created to try to get Trump involved</text>
  <text start="1110.83" dur="6.99">in Syria to show that Assad and Russia</text>
  <text start="1115.41" dur="3.08">look what they&amp;#39;ve been doing in this</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="4.48">country</text>
  <text start="1118.49" dur="6.689">and again there&amp;#39;s no evidence there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1122.3" dur="5.97">nothing there and they&amp;#39;re trying this</text>
  <text start="1125.179" dur="5.191">plan to try to get Trump involved but we</text>
  <text start="1128.27" dur="4.14">can see the Trump he&amp;#39;s not falling for</text>
  <text start="1130.37" dur="4.86">it he&amp;#39;s not going with it he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1132.41" dur="5.46">want to get involved in Syria and we can</text>
  <text start="1135.23" dur="4.29">see right now that the elite well once</text>
  <text start="1137.87" dur="4.559">again they&amp;#39;re backed against the wall</text>
  <text start="1139.52" dur="7.83">now they tried many different things to</text>
  <text start="1142.429" dur="7.561">try to retake Syria and if you notice</text>
  <text start="1147.35" dur="5.85">they haven&amp;#39;t given up on their goal to</text>
  <text start="1149.99" dur="7.59">remove Assad now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1153.2" dur="7.32">is that Syria was hit with a nation</text>
  <text start="1157.58" dur="4.62">whine electricity blackout now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1160.52" dur="4.2">saying it&amp;#39;s a technical issue and</text>
  <text start="1162.2" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re looking into it but we know that</text>
  <text start="1164.72" dur="4.83">the United States goes in certain</text>
  <text start="1167.03" dur="4.95">factions in the United States they go</text>
  <text start="1169.55" dur="4.11">into these countries and they knock out</text>
  <text start="1171.98" dur="4.44">the electricity they knock out the water</text>
  <text start="1173.66" dur="6.06">they do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="1176.42" dur="6.03">make the people pay for not allowing a</text>
  <text start="1179.72" dur="5.64">regime change and it seems that the</text>
  <text start="1182.45" dur="4.38">power was cut and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1185.36" dur="2.79">bring it all back online now there</text>
  <text start="1186.83" dur="4.92">wasn&amp;#39;t that much on the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1188.15" dur="5.31">and engineers are working to fix the</text>
  <text start="1191.75" dur="4.74">problem but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1193.46" dur="5.7">is that the elite well they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
  <text start="1196.49" dur="4.14">against the wall they know that this</text>
  <text start="1199.16" dur="4.59">economy is coming down I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1200.63" dur="4.47">reporting on all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="1203.75" dur="4.08">and they&amp;#39;re just getting worse right now</text>
  <text start="1205.1" dur="5.1">I mean Trump is in office he realizes</text>
  <text start="1207.83" dur="4.68">that this economy is not going to last</text>
  <text start="1210.2" dur="3.75">much longer the central banks they</text>
  <text start="1212.51" dur="3.06">understand this is why they&amp;#39;re picking</text>
  <text start="1213.95" dur="4.109">up the narrative of saying Trump is</text>
  <text start="1215.57" dur="3.81">going to be responsible now Trump is not</text>
  <text start="1218.059" dur="2.971">going to be enough they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="1219.38" dur="4.38">him but they&amp;#39;re afraid of what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1221.03" dur="5.82">going to do they need a huge distraction</text>
  <text start="1223.76" dur="5.19">just like in 911 when the Pentagon the</text>
  <text start="1226.85" dur="3.81">day before well there was an</text>
  <text start="1228.95" dur="3">investigation going on about trillions</text>
  <text start="1230.66" dur="3.75">of dollars that were just you know</text>
  <text start="1231.95" dur="3.66">missing right after nine eleven that</text>
  <text start="1234.41" dur="3.33">completely disappeared no one ever</text>
  <text start="1235.61" dur="4.92">brought it up again and we know the</text>
  <text start="1237.74" dur="6.12">documents were destroyed and what they</text>
  <text start="1240.53" dur="6.029">need is this huge distraction because</text>
  <text start="1243.86" dur="5.24">this is a huge crisis this is a collapse</text>
  <text start="1246.559" dur="5.161">of the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="1249.1" dur="3.02">economies not just here in the United</text>
  <text start="1251.72" dur="3.94">State</text>
  <text start="1252.12" dur="7.53">in Europe and everywhere else and they</text>
  <text start="1255.66" dur="5.94">need a distraction big enough to take</text>
  <text start="1259.65" dur="5.25">everyone&amp;#39;s eyes off of what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1261.6" dur="6.33">doing throughout these years since</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="4.89">nineteen thirteen and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1267.93" dur="4.02">people to know and they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="1269.79" dur="4.23">because Trump is a loose cannon</text>
  <text start="1271.95" dur="3.57">basically he&amp;#39;s unpredictable they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1274.02" dur="4.62">know what he&amp;#39;s going to do he might</text>
  <text start="1275.52" dur="6.3">present this evidence showing what</text>
  <text start="1278.64" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve been doing all along and they</text>
  <text start="1281.82" dur="6.15">can&amp;#39;t have this happen this is why they</text>
  <text start="1284.82" dur="5.13">are formulating a new plan for an event</text>
  <text start="1287.97" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re not going to wait too much</text>
  <text start="1289.95" dur="5.78">longer we know that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="1293.31" dur="4.71">falling apart they&amp;#39;re picking up on</text>
  <text start="1295.73" dur="4.66">putting the blame on Trump for this</text>
  <text start="1298.02" dur="5.34">economy failing there&amp;#39;s a report already</text>
