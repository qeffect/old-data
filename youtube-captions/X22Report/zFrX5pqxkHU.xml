  <text start="110.3" dur="4.319">deteriorate and fall apart very very</text>
  <text start="112.16" dur="4.05">quickly and they need to explain away</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="4.471">why these things are starting to happen</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="4.23">if you go back a couple reports I talked</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="3.18">about how the corporate media is going</text>
  <text start="120.44" dur="4.289">to be out there telling you that the</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="5.7">economy is collapsing and they are</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="5.071">starting to push that narrative that the</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="3.54">economy well there might be a problem</text>
  <text start="129.8" dur="3.54">the Fed is out there saying well we</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="3.059">might have problems with the economy but</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="2.64">you know what let&amp;#39;s raise those rates</text>
  <text start="134.569" dur="3.601">into the week of the economy we&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="3.66">had and we see right now that there are</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="3.06">more and more economic indicators that</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="3.9">are out there we see commercial</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="4.62">bankruptcy filings from corporations to</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="5.16">sole proprietorships well they spiked</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="5.31">twenty eight percent in march from</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="5.07">februari this is the largest month a</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="5.159">month move in the data series of the</text>
  <text start="153.77" dur="5.1">american bankruptcy institute going all</text>

  <text start="158.87" dur="5.839">percent year-over-year and over the past</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="5.76">24 months they have soared yes</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="6.791">thirty-seven percent there at the</text>
  <text start="167.3" dur="7.11">highest level of any march since 2013</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="6.63">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="174.41" dur="6.36">things are rapidly breaking down since</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="4.73">the low point in September of 2015</text>
  <text start="180.77" dur="5.63">commercial bankruptcies have soared</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="7.24">sixty-five percent that is a huge</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="5.29">increase now of course in the beginning</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="5.25">there they were blaming this on you know</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="5.52">the oil bust the energy market then they</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="3.63">were blaming it on the weather they were</text>
  <text start="197.21" dur="3.78">blaming on retail because of the brick</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="3.96">and mortar they&amp;#39;re not doing well things</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="3.48">are declining because of the shift to</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="3.96">online sales but we know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="4.35">completely fake phony and false things</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="4.41">are rapidly falling apart because the</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="4.56">economy is falling apart it has nothing</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="4.47">to do with the weather it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="213.38" dur="5.01">do with the one tenth of the sales going</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.88">to online it has nothing to do with that</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="6.48">and in March consumer bankruptcy filings</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="6.69">rose four percent year over a year this</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="5.88">is the highest since mar 2015 now total</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="5.64">US bankruptcy filings by consumers and</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="5.61">businesses in march spiked forty percent</text>
  <text start="233.99" dur="4.95">from februari and rose four percent</text>
  <text start="236.36" dur="4.11">year-over-year again when we look at</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="4.29">this and we could see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="6.12">we see that things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="5.82">apart and the corporate media the said</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="4.59">they understand what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="4.11">and now they&amp;#39;re starting to come out</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="3.45">with little trinkets here and there that</text>
  <text start="253.16" dur="3.63">yes things might be falling apart</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="5.31">because they&amp;#39;re setting this up</text>
  <text start="256.79" dur="4.919">completely and these rising bankruptcies</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.95">well they&amp;#39;re a turning point in the</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="5.521">credit cycle this is not a positive mile</text>
  <text start="264.89" dur="4.44">marker for the economy this is showing</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="4.89">us that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="5.58">now the Fed is warning that the stocks</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="4.59">yeah they might be overvalued and we</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="3.75">might have some type of stock correction</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="3.66">and when we look back in the past we can</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="4.5">see there two things that normally</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="4.29">happen here that when the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="4.8">there and they make an announcement in</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="5.73">their minutes they normally make it to</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="5.01">either drive the markets way up where</text>
  <text start="290.39" dur="5.19">they make it to bring the economy down</text>
  <text start="292.97" dur="5.34">and when we look back in time we can see</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="4.92">at all the different points of where the</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="3.6">Fed has done this and every time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="3.66">done this we see the market move up a</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="4.56">little bit and then it crashes or the</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.74">market comes right down when they wanted</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="4.86">to come down and we&amp;#39;re seeing at this</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="5.38">point they have tried three times from</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="5.58">2014 2015 20 17</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="4.95">Yellen has warned about the stock market</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="5.68">she&amp;#39;s trying to push it up to the</text>
  <text start="319.23" dur="6.72">highest point ever this last warning and</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="6.42">the raising of interest rates this is a</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="4.439">signal that all of a sudden this is</text>
  <text start="329.01" dur="4.08">going to collapse if we go back to</text>
  <text start="330.389" dur="4.921">nineteen ninety-six we go back to 2000</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="5.01">we can see this was done the exact same</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="4.35">way where they did the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="338.1" dur="4.17">where they gave us the mornings and the</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="4.8">market came tumbling down if we go back</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="4.11">two thousand eight two thousand four</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="3.75">they were doing the same thing then and</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="4.14">we could see when they started to raise</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="4.68">the interest rates well the economy</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="3.69">started to slow down everything started</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="3.54">to fall apart they had to bring their</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="5.88">interest rates down and everything just</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="6.93">collapsed we see bank america well</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="6.389">they&amp;#39;re showing us that the commercial</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="6.3">bank loan creation year over year well</text>
  <text start="366.479" dur="4.861">it is completely falling apart what</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="4.2">happened in two thousand and two</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="5.91">thousand eight is happening right now</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="6.9">and we can see that loan creation has</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="5.91">dropped dramatically this is an awful</text>
  <text start="380.76" dur="4.95">situation because we saw it happen back</text>
  <text start="383.16" dur="4.71">in two thousand and the entire economy</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="4.53">fell apart we saw it happen back in two</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="5.1">thousand eight and the entire economy</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="5.97">fell apart they pump this up once again</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="5.55">they tried to push it as hard as they</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="5.82">possibly can but loan creation right now</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="6.3">is almost at its lowest point as where</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.4">it was back in two thousand eight now</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="5.61">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a complete and</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="5.37">utter breakdown remember everything is</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="4.65">connected here it&amp;#39;s not just all the</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.67">economy and forget about the rest of the</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="5.79">world it&amp;#39;s all connected the entire</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="6.12">system is intertwined I said this before</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="5.31">and one one thing breaks it spreads to</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="3.75">many other things and this is why</text>
  <text start="426.18" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re so worried about the economy</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="2.82">right now because they could see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="2.78">happening in the Middle East and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="5.04">been saying this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="6.01">when these countries when we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="3.6">point where they&amp;#39;re going to decide hey</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="2.61">you know something we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="3.09">use the US dollar anymore we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="441.45" dur="4.38">going to sell the oil using the US</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="4.35">dollar this is where things rapidly fall</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="4.26">apart and</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="5.07">said many many reports ago there is</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="4.44">going to be a point where the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="3.9">going to have a na when I say the u.s.</text>
  <text start="454.53" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bankers</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="4.799">the deep state the neocons they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="4.919">to have to make a move to retake control</text>
  <text start="461.009" dur="5.19">of everything and push their agenda</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="6">forward because if they don&amp;#39;t it just</text>
  <text start="466.199" dur="5.4">all falls apart and that&amp;#39;s that and this</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="6.66">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we are</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="8.401">seeing that point that point in time is</text>
  <text start="475.949" dur="6.481">happening right now you can see how</text>
  <text start="480" dur="4.53">urgent it is where they&amp;#39;re saying we</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="5.7">need to stop what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="5.52">Middle East why because it threatens the</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="3.99">petro dollar has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="4.44">freedom has nothing to do with democracy</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="4.26">has nothing to do with crossing red</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="4.709">lines it has nothing to do with national</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="6.15">security has nothing to do with any of</text>
  <text start="499.199" dur="6.03">these things it has to do with paper and</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="6.66">ink and propping the system up and</text>
  <text start="505.229" dur="6.93">keeping it where it is until they decide</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="5.339">to bring it down and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="5.341">at right now they&amp;#39;re trying to push this</text>
  <text start="514.529" dur="5.13">one last time to see if they can keep</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="5.25">this system going but the system is</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="6.331">doomed it is completely doomed and no</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="6.63">matter what they do this entire economy</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="5.67">is going to come crashing down and this</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="3.899">is why you need to be prepared this is</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="4.53">why you need to be ready for what is</text>
  <text start="533.279" dur="5.161">coming because what is coming is going</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="4.709">to be a complete crash of the system and</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.44">it will happen in a split second does</text>
  <text start="540.899" dur="3.271">this mean the Federal Reserve the United</text>

  <text start="633.45" dur="5.01">and this is where phase two comes in</text>
  <text start="635.79" dur="5.46">because most likely with phase two well</text>

  <text start="703.02" dur="4.35">things will be start to get crazy where</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="3.42">the banking system closes down</text>
  <text start="707.37" dur="5.1">everything just comes to a screeching</text>

  <text start="728.279" dur="5.161">to push as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="6.93">because they know that this is the end</text>
  <text start="733.44" dur="7.32">they have nothing left to put out there</text>
  <text start="736.92" dur="7.289">they need these events to make an excuse</text>

  <text start="744.209" dur="6.031">prepared you need to get prepared</text>
