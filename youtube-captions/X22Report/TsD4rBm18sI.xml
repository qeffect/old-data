  <text start="66.25" dur="3.78">of the market they know what&amp;#39;s coming</text>

  <text start="70.03" dur="4.38">financial news now as we know and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="73.03" dur="4.71">been reporting on this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="74.41" dur="6.93">retail it&amp;#39;s continually sliding</text>
  <text start="77.74" dur="5.79">declining imploding on itself and the</text>
  <text start="81.34" dur="4.02">corporate media the US government the</text>
  <text start="83.53" dur="3.9">Fed they&amp;#39;ve been out there saying that</text>

  <text start="87.43" dur="3.78">everything&amp;#39;s going to online but coming</text>
  <text start="90.22" dur="2.819">out of the corporate media right now</text>
  <text start="91.21" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re starting to real they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="93.039" dur="5.281">to realize that retail is not going to</text>
  <text start="95.41" dur="5.849">get any better anytime soon right now</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="5.43">they are saying that the stress in the</text>
  <text start="101.259" dur="4.761">retail sector that has triggered a</text>
  <text start="103.75" dur="6.57">string of bankruptcy this year is</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="6.76">unlikely to get much better in 2018</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="3.87">because they&amp;#39;re starting to realize and</text>
  <text start="112.78" dur="3.6">of course they&amp;#39;re building up to that</text>
  <text start="114.19" dur="4.47">the economy is getting a lot worse now</text>
  <text start="116.38" dur="4.95">we don&amp;#39;t know why this is happening we</text>
  <text start="118.66" dur="4.56">had this recovery and we could see what</text>
  <text start="121.33" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="123.22" dur="7.17">the sector is expected to again produce</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="6.3">the most defaults at up to seven billion</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="5.37">dollars resulting in a ten percent</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="5.76">default rate now during the Great</text>
  <text start="135.76" dur="4.589">Recession the default rate was much</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.4">higher than that it was something like</text>
  <text start="140.349" dur="7.47">17 percent or so and we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="143.8" dur="6.21">that area once again and what is</text>
  <text start="147.819" dur="4.92">happening here is that it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="5.13">everyone is going to online because all</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="6.151">these companies like Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="5.94">Sears JCPenney all the chain stores they</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="5.22">all have an online presence it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="6.42">nothing you know special to have your</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="5.25">catalog on the web that&amp;#39;s really what it</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="3.84">is I mean back in the day Sears used to</text>
  <text start="169.36" dur="3.959">distribute a catalog used to look</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="4.649">through it and you used to order today</text>
  <text start="173.319" dur="5.161">that catalog is now on the Internet</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="5.851">everyone has their catalog on the</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="4.77">internet amazon has their catalog on the</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="4.53">internet and they really they have a</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="5.16">couple of stores but they are mostly on</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="4.589">but they like to use Amazon because they</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="4.77">sell pretty much everything and what is</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="4.681">happening here is that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="3.9">explain why all of this is happening and</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="2.429">they&amp;#39;re trying to come up with some type</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="4.7">of an excuse</text>
  <text start="198.069" dur="6.901">the real problem is is that people today</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;ve never really recovered from the</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="3.9">2008 crisis now there are certain</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="3.81">individuals and this happens in every</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="4.949">crisis there are certain individuals</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="5.28">that are not affected whatsoever they</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="4.861">get through it no problem they keep</text>
  <text start="216.37" dur="3.72">their job they don&amp;#39;t really realize that</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="2.85">anything&amp;#39;s wrong maybe they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="3.72">getting you know the cost-of-living</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="4.38">raise that they really wanted but</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re able to keep their job other</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="3.659">people were able to keep their job up to</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="4.079">a certain point and maybe last year or</text>
  <text start="229.569" dur="3.301">the year before they got laid off and</text>
  <text start="231.459" dur="3.81">they started to realize that hey there</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="4.92">are no jobs out there or they went to</text>
  <text start="235.269" dur="4.47">find another job and the salary has</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="3.479">dropped quite a bit but they were still</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="4.771">able to get a job but they had to take a</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="6.271">lower salary and then there are those</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="5.25">that got hit very very hard those</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.069">individuals that lost everything lost</text>
  <text start="249.76" dur="4.83">their pension lost their homes couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="4.5">find another job if they did it was a</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="4.739">part-time job or a job that was paying a</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="3.5">lot lesson that we&amp;#39;re making and they</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="4.77">did whatever they possibly could to</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="5.231">survive during this period of time and a</text>
  <text start="264.099" dur="4.771">lot of people had to readjust and</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="4.74">basically change their lives where they</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="3.45">said okay we can&amp;#39;t own that house</text>
  <text start="270.58" dur="4.47">anymore we can&amp;#39;t own this type of car</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="6.15">anymore and they had to make tough</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="6.27">choices some people had to move some</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="5.28">people just left their homes and what is</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="4.529">happening right now is we&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="4.979">to the point where there&amp;#39;s another wave</text>
  <text start="285.849" dur="5.281">of this coming and it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="288.729" dur="4.141">very difficult on many many individuals</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="3.509">especially those who were not affected</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="3.39">the last time because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="294.639" dur="4.981">sitting in the same exact job and when</text>
  <text start="296.26" dur="5.159">layoffs come in once again and you know</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="3.96">this sweeps through many of these</text>
  <text start="301.419" dur="4.68">sectors many of the industries people</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="4.41">are going to be shocked and surprised</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="4.051">that wait a minute I was just laid off</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;m putting out my resume I can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="4.769">jobs now they&amp;#39;re looking at all these</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="3.6">different stores we know that Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="314.919" dur="4.261">they declared bankruptcy but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="5.79">saying and this is coming from Fitch</text>
  <text start="319.18" dur="7.08">Petsmart Belk and Taylor parent a Senate</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="5.82">retail group tailored Brands Inc they</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="5">are going to be having a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="6.06">problems coming up very very soon and</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="6.37">right now the retail sector accounts for</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="6.3">30% of the defaults that have taken</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="5.61">place in 2017 to date and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="3.84">that this is going to increase as we</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="3.24">approach 2018</text>
  <text start="344.77" dur="3.6">now the only reason this is going to</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="3.84">increase it&amp;#39;s not like all the sales are</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="3.08">moving over to Amazon because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="350.32" dur="4.29">seeing that at all</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="5.62">so the reason why this is increasing is</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="5.46">because the economy is ripping itself</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="4.77">apart it&amp;#39;s not because oh wait a minute</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="3.63">online is getting all the sales because</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.26">they would show that they would say hey</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="4.23">look we had the retail sales in the</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="3.24">brick-and-mortar business and it was</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="3.54">sales of you know whatever it was a</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="4.65">hundred billion dollars and now amazon</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="5.61">is now receiving a hundred billion</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="5.94">dollars more you&amp;#39;re not seeing that so</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="4.73">this whole idea that Amazon is stealing</text>
  <text start="379.93" dur="5.94">everything is really not true because</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="7.15">the online business is only 10% of the</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="6.33">total retail sales now we talked about</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="6.63">the market and how certain institutional</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="4.8">investors they know what is happening in</text>
  <text start="395.59" dur="3.92">the market they know when to get out of</text>
  <text start="397" dur="4.8">the market these are the insiders and</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="6.43">what we see and this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="7.35">Bank of America they compiled this fun</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="5.7">flow data and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="6.03">Michael Hartnett and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="411.64" dur="7.32">these institutional investors these</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="7.11">insiders well they&amp;#39;re starting to move</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="5.7">out of their stocks so stock holding</text>
  <text start="422.29" dur="5.04">rotation is accelerating right now and</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re seeing another 8.8 billion</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="5.64">allocated to equities more than all of</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="6.54">it from retail investors and another 5.8</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="6.15">billion going into bonds so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="5.1">saying is that there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="4.65">insider institutional investors they are</text>
  <text start="441.79" dur="5.34">getting out of stocks right now and</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="5.97">there is a really great chart that shows</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="4.65">this where you can see the institutional</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="3.49">investors they&amp;#39;ve been selling like</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="3.25">crazy</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.89">because they understand that the market</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.25">has hit all-time new highs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.92" dur="5.94">overvalued we see stories coming out of</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.04">Yahoo Finance coming out of Market Watch</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="6">coming out of many of these financial</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="5.97">type of websites magazines and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="5.34">all saying the same thing right now and</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="6.12">this is the propaganda that leads up to</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="5.1">the market coming down because once they</text>
  <text start="479.99" dur="4.32">start dropping these type of articles we</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="3.81">saw it back in 2008 where they started</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="3.6">to mention the market coming down</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="3.81">because they liked to be covered to say</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="3.48">hey listen we were on top of this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.92" dur="4.44">telling you exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="4.95">and remember the economy hasn&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re still running under the Obama</text>
  <text start="496.34" dur="5.64">recovery right now and we knew and the</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="3.9">Fed knew the government knew that this</text>
  <text start="501.98" dur="3.96">recovery was only going to last a</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="4.41">certain period of time and here we are</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="3.57">right now at the end stage of it because</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="3.57">the Federal Reserve there&amp;#39;s no place for</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="3.69">them to go they can try to unwind they</text>
  <text start="511.67" dur="3.18">can&amp;#39;t really raise rates they&amp;#39;ll bring</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.05">down the economy if they try raising it</text>
  <text start="514.85" dur="4.08">1 or 2 more times it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="3.57">complete disaster deutsche bank ordered</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="3.84">reported on that same length and if they</text>
  <text start="520.82" dur="3.72">move the rates up a little bit more it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.77" dur="3.33">going to be a total disaster we saw what</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="3.24">happened when they raised the rates with</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="5.28">the mortgage applications with</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="6.9">refinancing applications with housing it</text>
  <text start="531.38" dur="5.43">all fell apart so here we are right now</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="4.38">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see many different</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="4.17">signs a lot of indicators showing that</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="3.48">we are already in this recession it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="3.51">getting worse and I&amp;#39;m saying that we</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="4.98">were in this recessions this recession</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="5.1">going back to 2016 everything is in a</text>

  <text start="552.35" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re deflating in Australia we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="4.56">seeing in the UK we&amp;#39;re seeing it here in</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="3.99">the United States we&amp;#39;re seeing homes on</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="3.3">the market longer and longer and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="4.23">saying it&amp;#39;s happening in every single</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="6.06">place it doesn&amp;#39;t happen all in one place</text>
  <text start="565.64" dur="7.44">at the same exact time go back to 2006</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="6.66">2007 Miami down in the Florida area they</text>
  <text start="573.08" dur="4.26">were building like crazy it hit first in</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="3.96">the northeastern area actually hit first</text>
  <text start="577.34" dur="3.27">out in California the rest of the</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="2.07">country said I don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.61" dur="2.97">going on here I don&amp;#39;t know why these</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="3.93">people leaving their homes why building</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="2.14">has coming to a screeching halt because</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="1.51">we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="3.869">building like crazy here we have</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="4.44">contracts you know out the window and</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="3.69">then all of a sudden six to eight months</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="4.589">later everything came to a halt</text>
  <text start="593.279" dur="4.73">buildings were empty people backed out</text>
  <text start="596.009" dur="3.93">because a lot of it was speculation and</text>
  <text start="598.009" dur="3.58">everything started to fall apart so if</text>
  <text start="599.939" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re in that area where things are</text>
  <text start="601.589" dur="5.161">great right now it&amp;#39;s going to catch up</text>
  <text start="604.199" dur="3.81">to you slowly but surely and over the</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="2.79">period of time that we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="608.009" dur="4.231">about all this people have been writing</text>
