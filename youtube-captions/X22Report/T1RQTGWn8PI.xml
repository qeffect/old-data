  <text start="111.869" dur="4.081">interesting was in the message we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="3.75">talking about that a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="5.76">this report but first the EU is getting</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.47">frustrated with Boris Johnson Donald</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.019">Tusk the President of the European</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="6.03">Council tweeted out the following at</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="6.001">Boris Johnson what&amp;#39;s at stake is not</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="5.04">winning some stupid blame game at stake</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="3.75">is the future of Europe and the UK as</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="3.12">well as the security and interest of the</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="4.17">people you don&amp;#39;t want to deal you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="4.64">want an extension you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="5.67">revoke Quo Vadis</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="6.04">meaning where are you going well I think</text>
  <text start="145.32" dur="4.77">Boris Johnson knows exactly where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="4.71">going Merkel reportedly insisted that</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="4.83">the eu-27 would never agree to a brexit</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="4.35">deal that didn&amp;#39;t include a bank stop</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.209">arrangement that would keep Northern</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="7.019">Ireland in the Custom Union basically</text>
  <text start="160.129" dur="4.301">what they are saying is listen you do it</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="5.31">our way</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="7.77">or there is no way Johnson told German</text>
  <text start="169.079" dur="5.431">Chancellor Angela Merkel that a brexit</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="4.59">deal is essentially impossible if the EU</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="4.229">demands Northern Ireland should stay in</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="4.169">the Blanc&amp;#39;s custom Union now think about</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="6.06">what is happening here think about what</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="6.721">the EU has set up Boris Johnson is</text>
  <text start="184.799" dur="5.701">dealing with the EU the EU will only</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="5.19">agree to a deal that benefits them then</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="4.579">goes back to the UK and those</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="6.42">individuals the elite the establishment</text>
  <text start="195.079" dur="7.391">they don&amp;#39;t want a known deal brexit now</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="5.64">what is Boris Johnson one he wants a No</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="4.29">Deal brexit or a deal that is in the</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="4.83">best a job the people so he&amp;#39;s fighting</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="5.099">the EU on one side he turns around and</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="6.899">he&amp;#39;s fighting the elite on the other</text>
  <text start="211.859" dur="9.03">side but I believe the EU made a</text>
  <text start="216.659" dur="6.541">tactical error in their strategy the</text>
  <text start="220.889" dur="6.421">elite the establishment made a tactical</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="7.95">error in their strategy what appears to</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="7.889">be a chaotic strategy might not be</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.809">chaotic at all it might be that this is</text>
  <text start="235.199" dur="4.921">what Boris Johnson planned now everyone</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="3">thinks that he&amp;#39;s a fool he doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="4.949">what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="7.831">and it seems that the EU might have</text>
  <text start="245.069" dur="8.16">seriously misjudged what he is doing</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="7.789">right now think about this for a sec it</text>
  <text start="253.229" dur="8.901">was the UK who for the longest time</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="10.09">misjudged the EU now the EU is</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="6.64">misjudging the UK the final irony is</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="4.5">that by attempting to take a no deal off</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="5.579">the table remain errs the elite the</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="7.771">establishment just may have sealed their</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="6.53">fate this is most likely how this might</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="4.399">play out</text>
  <text start="280.879" dur="3.981">the EU does not agree to a deal well</text>
  <text start="283.339" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s a given</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.669">Johnson is dragged kicking and screaming</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="9.15">into an extension he wins the ensuing</text>
  <text start="291.529" dur="8.97">elections a No Deal brexit follows and I</text>
  <text start="296.629" dur="6.451">do believe that the EU the elite they</text>
  <text start="300.499" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t see this coming we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="4.229">how it plays out but it seems like this</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="5.28">is what Boris Johnson is trying to push</text>
  <text start="307.309" dur="5.28">right now now here in the US</text>
  <text start="310.069" dur="4.65">Trump signed trade deals with Japan</text>
  <text start="312.589" dur="4.741">South Korea Mexico and Canada the</text>
  <text start="314.719" dur="5.43">problem is that Congress needs to pass</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="5.489">the u.s. MCA Trump the team Trump</text>
  <text start="320.149" dur="4.38">tweeted out the following president at</text>
  <text start="322.819" dur="4.02">real Donald Trump is negotiating real</text>
  <text start="324.529" dur="5.25">trade deals for the American people he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.839" dur="4.95">made fair trade deals with Japan South</text>
  <text start="329.779" dur="5.521">Korea Mexico and Canada remember Mexico</text>
  <text start="331.789" dur="5.011">and Canada it&amp;#39;s the u.s. MCA no more</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="5.419">taking advantage of the United States</text>
  <text start="336.8" dur="7.609">Congress must also pass the u.s. MCA and</text>
  <text start="340.719" dur="6.85">Congress the do-nothing Congress has not</text>
  <text start="344.409" dur="4.18">so once again Congress is doing</text>
  <text start="347.569" dur="4.14">absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="348.589" dur="5.31">the reason Trump needs this complete is</text>
  <text start="351.709" dur="4.83">because the trade deals are needed for</text>
  <text start="353.899" dur="5.79">the transition once we leave the central</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="5.701">bank system just like the UK is leaving</text>
  <text start="359.689" dur="4.89">the EU system well the United States is</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="5.399">going to be leaving the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="364.579" dur="5.221">System we will no longer be dependent on</text>
  <text start="367.639" dur="5.07">the petro dollar the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="4.919">Note in countries around the world will</text>
  <text start="372.709" dur="3.901">no longer need to keep the Fed note in</text>
  <text start="374.719" dur="5.75">their reserves which means they will not</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="7.979">buy goods by trading in their Fed notes</text>
  <text start="380.469" dur="6.67">we will need equal trade this is why</text>
  <text start="384.589" dur="4.32">Trump is doing this plus trade had been</text>
  <text start="387.139" dur="3.99">lopsided for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a reason for that because the</text>
  <text start="391.129" dur="3.69">deep state the elite the establishment</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="2.701">the central makers they had a completely</text>
  <text start="394.819" dur="2.7">different plan they were moving</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="3.359">everything out of the United States</text>
  <text start="397.519" dur="5.1">because when everything started to go</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="5.91">south and crash and implode the United</text>
  <text start="402.619" dur="5.371">States was no longer to me the reserve</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="4.26">currency and the United States was going</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="5.82">to be brought down to a third world</text>
  <text start="409.579" dur="6.871">nation everything has changed</text>
  <text start="413.81" dur="3.93">Trump put the kibosh on all of that got</text>
  <text start="416.45" dur="4.41">rid of the globalist deals even</text>
  <text start="417.74" dur="4.79">mentioned that the globalists have no</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="4.68">future</text>
  <text start="422.53" dur="6.01">so when Trump was signing the trade deal</text>
  <text start="425.54" dur="6.45">with Japan team Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="5.97">something very interesting and said</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="5.34">watch president at real Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="434.51" dur="6">discuss signing to early outcomes from</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="5.16">trade negotiations with Japan number one</text>
  <text start="440.51" dur="4.02">will allow better access for</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="4.26">approximately 90 percent of u.s.</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="5.13">agricultural exports to Japan</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="5.88">Trump is helping the farmers now number</text>
  <text start="449.66" dur="5.04">two is very interesting now this has to</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="5.46">do with digital trade but they said</text>
  <text start="454.7" dur="6">something that&amp;#39;s very very interesting</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="5.12">and I believe this is a message to all</text>
  <text start="460.7" dur="6.87">the people that are paying attention</text>
  <text start="463.21" dur="8.95">sets gold standard rules for digital</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="7.95">trade and gold standard is in quotes now</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="8.16">let&amp;#39;s go back to post 2619 remember this</text>

  <text start="480.32" dur="7.26">have the gold and cue answered yes yes</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="4.56">we do now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="3.69">that there is gold in Fort Knox it</text>
  <text start="489.38" dur="6.36">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that&amp;#39;s where the gold is</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="9.12">located remember but we all believe is</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="10.05">that the Fed the deep state they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="7.83">moving gold offshore there are those</text>
  <text start="505.79" dur="6.33">individuals out there that believe the</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="7.11">Trump administration got this gold back</text>
  <text start="512.12" dur="6.06">and this is why q is saying yes we do</text>
  <text start="515.33" dur="8.639">have the gold and I don&amp;#39;t believe they</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="9.63">placed it in Fort Knox and under this it</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="8.011">says gold shall destroy the Fed so with</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="7.02">this tweet I do believe the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="6.63">saying we&amp;#39;re going back to some type of</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="8.67">sound money gold standard and in the end</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="6.75">it will destroy the Fed and everything</text>
  <text start="543.5" dur="3.51">is on track yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="3.87">how Jerome Pao</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="4.62">was out there saying that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="549.23" dur="4.29">completely independent they don&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="3.57">orders from the White House they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.52" dur="5.87">do what the White House wants or what</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="7.02">Trump wants this was being said on</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="5.65">purpose he was projecting out letting</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="6.63">everyone know their next decision wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="7.31">based on Trump and guess what they just</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="6.23">made a decision and they&amp;#39;re right on</text>
  <text start="572.35" dur="6.64">schedule</text>
  <text start="575.08" dur="7.33">fed chair Powell made a surprise</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="6.27">announcement today that the Fed was</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="8.52">resuming permanent open market</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="8.94">operations after a five-year hiatus what</text>
  <text start="590.93" dur="5.76">does that mean it means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="5.79">adding reserves to the system on a</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="6.56">permanent basis via permanent open</text>
  <text start="599.99" dur="7.91">market operations for example bond</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="8.14">purchases this is quantitative easing</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="5.32">the US has facing an avalanche of debt</text>
  <text start="611.39" dur="5.55">issuance with China and Japan barely</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="8.7">able to keep up someone needs to buy all</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="5.42">this debt the someone is the Fed here we</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="6.24">are</text>
  <text start="622.36" dur="9.09">remember 2010 2011 we&amp;#39;re right back to</text>
  <text start="628.16" dur="7.47">that point where the Fed has now started</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="7.96">stimulus once again and the debt is</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="5.33">going to be astronomical so think about</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="4.53">what is happening here</text>
  <text start="640.96" dur="6.19">Trump and the Patriots are forcing the</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="5.52">Fed to do everything they did back</text>
  <text start="647.15" dur="5.07">during the Obama administration but</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="4.71">Trump needs this to go a step further he</text>
  <text start="652.22" dur="4.74">needs the Federal Reserve to drive</text>
  <text start="654.17" dur="6.47">itself into the ground and off the cliff</text>
  <text start="656.96" dur="7.08">and this is exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="660.64" dur="8.13">he needs the central bank system to</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="7.86">destroy itself while at the same time</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="6.82">reversing everything that was done to</text>
  <text start="671.9" dur="5.08">this country the plan is right on</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="5.14">schedule</text>
  <text start="676.98" dur="6.84">the plan is working exactly the way we</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="8.12">fill up now think about this once Trump</text>
  <text start="683.82" dur="8.519">is elected in 2020 what comes next</text>
  <text start="688.85" dur="5.65">well if Trump is driving the Fed off the</text>
  <text start="692.339" dur="4.881">cliff and the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="7.459">state they&amp;#39;re talking about a recession</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="8.5">we know that this drug that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="701.959" dur="5.62">injected into the system will not last</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="7.049">forever Trump of the Patriots they know</text>
  <text start="707.579" dur="7.76">this it will not last forever but</text>
  <text start="712.769" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re not expecting it to last forever</text>
  <text start="715.339" dur="6.221">they want the system to calm down when</text>
  <text start="719.699" dur="3.561">they are ready and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="4.98">Patriots when they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="723.26" dur="6.15">this way they can control what is</text>
  <text start="726.54" dur="6.18">happening they don&amp;#39;t want the deep state</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="6.16">to push us into a recession because they</text>
  <text start="732.72" dur="5.489">don&amp;#39;t have control then once Trump is in</text>
  <text start="735.57" dur="5.94">the White House for a second term he is</text>
