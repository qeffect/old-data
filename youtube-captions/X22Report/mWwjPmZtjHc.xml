  <text start="68.89" dur="5.22">the White Rabbit let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.369" dur="4.411">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="74.11" dur="5.369">geopolitical news now over the past many</text>
  <text start="76.78" dur="4.74">years we talked about Obamacare and how</text>
  <text start="79.479" dur="4.351">this was completely unconstitutional we</text>
  <text start="81.52" dur="3.599">know a Supreme Court Justice Roberts he</text>
  <text start="83.83" dur="4.8">continually said it was unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="85.119" dur="5.31">in just one day he said it was</text>
  <text start="88.63" dur="3.21">constitutional and then like left the</text>
  <text start="90.429" dur="3.571">country for two weeks it looks like</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="5.22">maybe he was blackmailed or something</text>
  <text start="94" dur="5.1">into pushing Obamacare forward saying it</text>
  <text start="97.06" dur="4.86">was constitutional but it looks like</text>
  <text start="99.1" dur="5.34">right now in a letter to House Speaker</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="4.11">Ryan Attorney General Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="104.44" dur="3.289">affirmed that the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="106.03" dur="5.82">will no longer defend the</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="5.081">constitutionality of Obamacare session</text>
  <text start="111.85" dur="3.39">writes that the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="4.89">believes that the laws individual</text>
  <text start="115.24" dur="4.59">mandate the provision the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="5.759">upheld in 2012 has become</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="5.34">unconstitutional nota lis the three-page</text>
  <text start="123.459" dur="4.8">letter begins by saying that justice</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="5.27">opted its position with the approval of</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="4.651">the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="4.75">specifically sessions writes that the</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="4.82">mandate cannot be interpreted as a tax</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="5.129">because it will raise no revenue as</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="6.55">Congress has eliminated the monetary</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="7.021">penalty now we see right now that at</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="5.099">this point I think it&amp;#39;s next year you</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="4.02">will not be penalized if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="149.379" dur="4.651">select insurance or if you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="5.489">Obamacare the penalty has dropped to</text>
  <text start="154.03" dur="6.569">zero and if we really look at this this</text>
  <text start="156.849" dur="6.301">was a tax without representation I mean</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="3.811">this is the basis of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="1.589">the founding fathers what they fought</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="5.03">for</text>
  <text start="164.739" dur="8.991">and here our government was taxing us on</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="8.35">something they wanted to push at us and</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="7.81">forcing us to do something and if you</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="5.029">didn&amp;#39;t do it you were penalized and that</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="3.44">you would be taxed</text>
  <text start="182.819" dur="6.12">I mean this is just absolutely</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="6.539">ridiculous and this is why Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="188.939" dur="3.69">Justice Roberts over many many months</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="3.09">said this was completely</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="4.741">unconstitutional and all of a sudden he</text>
  <text start="194.609" dur="4.05">changed his mind and now we see that the</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="2.399">Department of Justice is out there</text>
  <text start="198.659" dur="3.181">saying yeah this is completely</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="4.92">unconstitutional it looks like it was</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="5.22">set up this way so they could say it was</text>
  <text start="204.689" dur="5.22">unconstitutional because they removed</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="6.239">the penalty saying that hey look</text>
  <text start="209.909" dur="5.521">it is now unconstitutional because the</text>
  <text start="213.299" dur="4.77">penalty can&amp;#39;t be interpreted as a tax</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="5.449">because we&amp;#39;re not collecting anything so</text>
  <text start="218.069" dur="5.28">right now it looks like Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="220.879" dur="6.73">completely dead in the water and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="6.271">time to remove it now the Department of</text>
  <text start="227.609" dur="4.681">Justice they&amp;#39;re gonna be releasing a</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="4.739">report on the Clinton email probe and</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re saying that this report is</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="6.63">coming out on June 14th which is Flag</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="6.679">Day and I would expect to see some type</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="5.851">of an event a distraction or something</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="6.97">depending on what this report says and</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="6.81">we know that this I G report on Clinton</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.851">the email probe was in its final review</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.399">and which has found among other things</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="5.28">that James Comey and only the finest</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.771">aura t but was insubordinate we finally</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="4.29">have the long way to drop date which is</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="3.81">June 14th and the Department of</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="3.18">Justice&amp;#39;s Inspector General Michael</text>

  <text start="271.139" dur="6">in a letter on Thursday that this office</text>
  <text start="275.849" dur="3.75">is planning to release the highly</text>

  <text start="284.34" dur="4.829">months leading up to the 2016 election</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="5.1">and it only gets better from there</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="5.34">because Horowitz also said that he will</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="7.169">testify before the Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="294.509" dur="6.391">on the 18th of June and I believe a lot</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="4.231">of people are gonna be watching that now</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="4.97">it all depends what comes out of all</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="5.429">this but this is going to include</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="5.409">certain things on Hillary Clinton the</text>
  <text start="308.699" dur="5.34">email and other things now are they</text>
  <text start="311.279" dur="3.301">going to release all of this maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="2.911">not</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="5.22">but the debate is going to go</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="4.29">back to the Clinton email server and I</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="3.96">think this is why Trump has been</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="5.58">tweeting out about a won Debbie</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="5.46">wasserman-schultz the server and he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="717.66" dur="5.22">and just keep that in the back of your</text>
  <text start="718.98" dur="6.48">mind so what was the pattern with wolf</text>
  <text start="722.88" dur="4.47">here an ongoing pattern stretching back</text>
  <text start="725.46" dur="4.68">years and years and years stretching</text>
  <text start="727.35" dur="4.86">back so far you have to wonder who was</text>

  <text start="753.96" dur="9.81">though wonder what was on the phone what</text>
  <text start="758.97" dur="8.64">was happening here and once again we see</text>
  <text start="763.77" dur="7.2">that these individuals it&amp;#39;s all</text>

  <text start="775.68" dur="5.13">been gone ongoing for quite a while</text>
  <text start="778.68" dur="6.42">and we&amp;#39;re gonna find out a lot more</text>

  <text start="785.1" dur="3.81">mean let&amp;#39;s follow the White Rabbit here</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re going deep down the rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="788.91" dur="5.61">once again and there&amp;#39;s so much now</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="4.35">Facebook is back in the news once again</text>
  <text start="794.52" dur="5.25">and we need to go back a little bit in</text>
  <text start="796.59" dur="4.89">time here remember two months ago before</text>
  <text start="799.77" dur="3.18">Facebook announced its planned to</text>
  <text start="801.48" dur="3.87">publish exclusive content from</text>
  <text start="802.95" dur="6.42">establishment media outlets Mark</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="7.05">Zuckerberg the CEO of Facebook assured</text>
  <text start="809.37" dur="6.6">Congress that the platform isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="812.4" dur="5.63">publisher Zuckerberg insisted that</text>
  <text start="815.97" dur="4.8">Facebook did not produce the content</text>
  <text start="818.03" dur="4.99">that populates the platform implying</text>
  <text start="820.77" dur="5.01">that it was therefore not subject to the</text>

  <text start="825.78" dur="4.98">including legal liability for their</text>

  <text start="830.76" dur="6.45">its programme of publishing exclusive</text>
  <text start="833.91" dur="5.25">news content from the corporate media I</text>
  <text start="837.21" dur="3.84">think it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little bit harder</text>
  <text start="839.16" dur="4.08">for the company to escape the charge</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="3.36">that it is no longer a neutral unbiased</text>
  <text start="843.24" dur="4.02">platform</text>
  <text start="844.41" dur="5.64">this could mean Facebook falls outside</text>
  <text start="847.26" dur="4.05">the bounds of section 230 of the</text>
  <text start="850.05" dur="3.66">Communications</text>

  <text start="864.51" dur="6.63">be a fundamental threat to its business</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="9.21">model so they&amp;#39;re gonna be in hot water</text>
  <text start="871.14" dur="7.32">if they pursue this Avenue of basically</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="4.71">going down this line and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="878.46" dur="5.61">be responsible because they will then</text>
  <text start="880.5" dur="6.06">become a news outlet which Zuckerberg is</text>
  <text start="884.07" dur="4.83">saying they&amp;#39;re not but they&amp;#39;re moving in</text>
  <text start="886.56" dur="5.25">that direction so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="4.83">wait to see how that turns out we also</text>
  <text start="891.81" dur="5.4">see that four million Facebook users</text>
  <text start="893.73" dur="6.27">might have unknowingly shared post with</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="4.35">the public days after the company was</text>
  <text start="900" dur="5.339">exposed for sharing dated with sixty</text>
  <text start="901.56" dur="5.58">major device developers contradicting</text>
  <text start="905.339" dur="4.801">testimony that Zuckerberg gave to</text>
  <text start="907.14" dur="5.91">Congress recode is reporting that the</text>
  <text start="910.14" dur="5.85">company has copped to another colossal</text>
  <text start="913.05" dur="4.71">blunder as many as fourteen million</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="4.2">Facebook users who believe they were</text>
  <text start="917.76" dur="4.65">posted items that only their friends or</text>
  <text start="920.19" dur="4.17">smaller groups could access and state</text>
  <text start="922.41" dur="5.37">met instead may have shared their</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="6.06">contact publicly and we can see that</text>
  <text start="927.78" dur="6.63">this is one gigantic disaster after</text>
  <text start="930.42" dur="6.87">another and Facebook knows exactly what</text>
  <text start="934.41" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re doing there&amp;#39;s no bugs they know</text>
  <text start="937.29" dur="2.97">that that they&amp;#39;re selling it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="938.55" dur="4.02">receiving money they know who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.26" dur="4.32">accessing their site they have all the</text>
  <text start="942.57" dur="4.95">logs they know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="944.58" dur="4.95">and this was business as usual it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="947.52" dur="4.02">always business as usual until these</text>
  <text start="949.53" dur="4.26">companies get caught once they get</text>
  <text start="951.54" dur="4.38">caught they say oh it was a bug we</text>
  <text start="953.79" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t know and they use many many</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="3.9">excuses but this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="957.57" dur="4.74">years and years and years I mean think</text>
  <text start="959.82" dur="4.83">about it they know when you put up a</text>
  <text start="962.31" dur="4.649">piece of music if it&amp;#39;s copyrighted or</text>
  <text start="964.65" dur="4.26">not you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="966.959" dur="4.591">tell if data&amp;#39;s being stolen from them of</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="4.17">course they can they know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.55" dur="4.86">going on and they&amp;#39;re selling most of</text>
  <text start="973.08" dur="5.82">this data now it looks like Putin and</text>
  <text start="976.41" dur="5.01">Trump Namie they might be trying to get</text>
  <text start="978.9" dur="5.79">together for a summit and it looked like</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="5.97">Putin was asking Austria to set up a</text>
  <text start="984.69" dur="4.26">summit with Trump in Vienna and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="987.39" dur="2.73">have to wait to see how this turns out</text>
  <text start="988.95" dur="3.39">of course the corporate media is gonna</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="5.22">bashed us like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow and</text>
  <text start="992.34" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that turns out we</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="5.52">also see the Pentagon right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.19" dur="5.19">debating about cutting US Special Forces</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="6.66">in Africa because what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="1003.38" dur="7.29">why do we have troops in Africa there is</text>
  <text start="1007.52" dur="5.94">no reason for it and it&amp;#39;s time to start</text>
  <text start="1010.67" dur="4.56">to reduce the number of troops now right</text>
  <text start="1013.46" dur="5.43">now we have about 1,200 Special Forces</text>
  <text start="1015.23" dur="5.46">in there we have other forces in Africa</text>
  <text start="1018.89" dur="3.72">and they want to start reducing the</text>
  <text start="1020.69" dur="3.21">number of forces there and I think</text>
  <text start="1022.61" dur="2.76">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen around the world</text>
  <text start="1023.9" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re gonna look at all these</text>
  <text start="1025.37" dur="4.199">situations and remember all these</text>
  <text start="1026.54" dur="6.69">situations they were created by the deep</text>
  <text start="1029.569" dur="4.531">state all these hotspots that we see</text>
  <text start="1033.23" dur="3.089">around the world</text>
  <text start="1034.1" dur="4.41">they had their paid mercenary armies</text>
  <text start="1036.319" dur="6.211">which was the Islamic state al Qaeda Al</text>
  <text start="1038.51" dur="6.9">Shabaab al nusra you name it they were</text>
  <text start="1042.53" dur="6.39">in these countries creating problems</text>
  <text start="1045.41" dur="5.46">once the problem was created the deep</text>
  <text start="1048.92" dur="3.63">state would say hey we can help out with</text>
  <text start="1050.87" dur="3.48">that you have terrorists we can send</text>
  <text start="1052.55" dur="4.11">troops to that area and basically the</text>
  <text start="1054.35" dur="4.62">troops would garrison the current</text>
  <text start="1056.66" dur="4.71">country and the deep state would then</text>
  <text start="1058.97" dur="3.81">have control over the country and they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1061.37" dur="3.18">say oh you need more equipment we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1062.78" dur="3.09">sell you more equipment and this is what</text>
  <text start="1064.55" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;ve done throughout the countries</text>
  <text start="1065.87" dur="4.59">and we know we know it&amp;#39;s been done in</text>
  <text start="1067.4" dur="7.59">the Middle East where they created a</text>
  <text start="1070.46" dur="7.14">problem there and the problem escalated</text>
  <text start="1074.99" dur="4.8">and then there was regime change and</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="4.47">then those people who didn&amp;#39;t like regime</text>
  <text start="1079.79" dur="5.37">change they wanted their governments</text>
  <text start="1082.07" dur="5.88">back so the the deep state passed laws</text>
  <text start="1085.16" dur="5.55">saying that they can go after al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1087.95" dur="4.02">anywhere and it wasn&amp;#39;t really al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1090.71" dur="4.29">they were going after because al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="5.79">is they&amp;#39;re paid mercenary army they were</text>
  <text start="1095" dur="4.95">going after all those individuals that</text>
  <text start="1097.76" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t like the puppet governments they</text>
  <text start="1099.95" dur="2.7">called them al Qaeda that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="1102.23" dur="2.76">worked</text>
  <text start="1102.65" dur="7.23">they used al Qaeda the terrorist to</text>
  <text start="1104.99" dur="8.1">remove the leaders once the leaders were</text>
  <text start="1109.88" dur="5.01">removed they called all those people who</text>
  <text start="1113.09" dur="4.38">were against the new puppet government</text>
  <text start="1114.89" dur="3.48">al Qaeda so they could use drone strikes</text>
  <text start="1117.47" dur="3.69">and base</text>
  <text start="1118.37" dur="4.95">they continue this war against the</text>
  <text start="1121.16" dur="4.23">people who didn&amp;#39;t want the u.s. in the</text>
  <text start="1123.32" dur="4.47">country this is how the deep state</text>
  <text start="1125.39" dur="4.65">worked I mean look at Syria that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1127.79" dur="4.5">perfect example they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="1130.04" dur="6.87">Islamic state al Qaeda al nusra to</text>
  <text start="1132.29" dur="6.87">remove Assad once Assad was removed they</text>
  <text start="1136.91" dur="4.5">would say okay al Qaeda is trying to</text>
  <text start="1139.16" dur="4.32">attack the puppet government then they</text>
  <text start="1141.41" dur="5.07">would use drone attacks against al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1143.48" dur="4.98">but it was it wouldn&amp;#39;t be al Qaeda it</text>
  <text start="1146.48" dur="3.75">would be the people that didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="1148.46" dur="3.99">puppet government they just switched it</text>
  <text start="1150.23" dur="4.77">around that&amp;#39;s all they did and they made</text>
  <text start="1152.45" dur="4.14">us believe that they were going after</text>
  <text start="1155" dur="3.6">terrorists they weren&amp;#39;t that they took</text>
  <text start="1156.59" dur="4.11">their paid mercenary army and they moved</text>
  <text start="1158.6" dur="3.92">him off to someplace else to do</text>
  <text start="1160.7" dur="4.71">something else in another country so</text>
  <text start="1162.52" dur="4.03">here we are today the Pentagon the</text>
  <text start="1165.41" dur="3.09">Patriots they&amp;#39;re looking around the</text>
  <text start="1166.55" dur="3.75">world saying mo what do we need all</text>
  <text start="1168.5" dur="4.38">these troops for why are we in Africa</text>
  <text start="1170.3" dur="5.24">well we were in Africa because the</text>
  <text start="1172.88" dur="6">Chinese were in Africa but right now</text>
  <text start="1175.54" dur="7.03">everything is changing China didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1178.88" dur="5.31">bring troops into Africa China was</text>
  <text start="1182.57" dur="4.89">dealing with many of the African nations</text>
  <text start="1184.19" dur="7.52">economically to set up for the one belt</text>
  <text start="1187.46" dur="7.14">one road and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1191.71" dur="5.53">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the u.s. to be in</text>
  <text start="1194.6" dur="5.28">all of these areas because all of these</text>
  <text start="1197.24" dur="5.189">areas were created by the deep state</text>
  <text start="1199.88" dur="4.41">they call them hotspots we need to go</text>
  <text start="1202.429" dur="4.351">into these areas and there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1204.29" dur="4.92">for it anymore so everything is changing</text>
  <text start="1206.78" dur="4.41">right now slowly but surely but we can</text>
  <text start="1209.21" dur="4.11">see right now the Patriots they do have</text>
  <text start="1211.19" dur="4.17">the control they are pointing fingers</text>
  <text start="1213.32" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re bringing out the indictments</text>
  <text start="1215.36" dur="3.87">these are year-long investigations and</text>
