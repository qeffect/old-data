  <text start="150.159" dur="6.121">much told the EU the European Union that</text>
  <text start="154.659" dur="4.431">we don&amp;#39;t want to have anything to do</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="6.36">with you guys and Iceland right now is</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="6.88">looking to turn itself into a hub for</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="6.87">business in the Arctic and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="5.159">trying to build up trade by doing this</text>
  <text start="169.51" dur="4.77">and Iceland became the first european</text>
  <text start="171.129" dur="6.151">country to sign a bilateral bilateral</text>
  <text start="174.28" dur="7.349">free trade agreement with China and we</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="7.319">can see that right now Iceland believes</text>
  <text start="181.629" dur="5.161">it&amp;#39;s very important to have a free trade</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="4.771">agreement with China Chinese are</text>
  <text start="186.79" dur="4.589">interested in Iceland and the Arctic and</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="5.19">naturally Iceland should utilize the</text>
  <text start="191.379" dur="5.131">interest and we can see that China and</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="6.679">Iceland and China and many other</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="7.86">countries are all making deals they are</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="7.06">going out to all these different nations</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="7.229">and they are making business deals to</text>
  <text start="208.299" dur="5.94">support what is about to happen and on</text>
  <text start="211.599" dur="6.121">the other hand we see the Empire of the</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="6.661">United States not making deals instead</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="6.299">they are making war they are using drone</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="6.199">strikes they are using military force to</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="5.911">keep the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="227.099" dur="6.07">currency and what else are they doing</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="6.149">well the u.s. is also spying on every</text>
  <text start="233.169" dur="6.57">single nation and you know we can just</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="6.541">see that we are headed towards the</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="6.571">endgame here and if we look at every</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="5.31">other type of civilization and towards</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="4.17">the end what do they normally end up</text>
  <text start="247.93" dur="4.98">doing printing a lot of money they</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="4.47">become desperate they start spying on</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="3.99">other countries they want to know what</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.56">everyone is doing they use military</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="5.91">force to keep what they have in power</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="5.55">and we are seeing this happen right now</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s unfolding in right in front of our</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="4.919">eyes and when we look back we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="4.56">to say holy it really was happening and</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="4.671">it is definitely happening and</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="5.3">throughout Europe and if</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="5.64">actually I mean if we look at Europe and</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="6.96">we go back to nineteen twenty-nine right</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="5.909">before that during the 20s Europe was</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="5.069">having a major problem during this</text>
  <text start="286.199" dur="5.101">period I mean we look at Germany we look</text>
  <text start="289.139" dur="5.4">at many of the European nations they</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="5.339">were in a recession / depression this is</text>
  <text start="294.539" dur="3.781">what we are seeing right now we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="3.691">seeing nations that have all they have</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="3.81">you know eight percent unemployment or</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="3.51">nine percent we&amp;#39;re looking at nations</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.409">there that has twenty percent</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="5.43">twenty-five percent thirty-one percent</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="5.371">the youth unemployment ranging anywhere</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="5.73">from forty all the way up to sixty-five</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="6.42">percent we are seeing a complete</text>
  <text start="315" dur="5.97">breakdown of the system right now and</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="5.13">this is why all the countries are taking</text>
  <text start="320.97" dur="4.949">on the white paper the FDIC Bank of</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="5.28">England white paper and implementing</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="5.161">them in their country to have balance if</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="5.7">things are okay and things are going</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="7.55">swell there&amp;#39;s no reason to have these</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="10.979">type of documents there is no reason to</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="8.56">to have the IMF out there where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="5.131">saying that they&amp;#39;re looking at eight ten</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="5.52">percent across the board savings account</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.07">tax which you know in the end will</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="4.38">always be a lot more because if we look</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="3.06">back at Cypress they told us you know</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="3.69">they were only going to take about eight</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="3.63">to ten percent of the people&amp;#39;s money and</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="3.9">they ended up taking forty seven percent</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="4.8">of the people&amp;#39;s money and they only said</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="3.75">and if we look back in Cyprus they said</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="3.9">you know capital controls will be only</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="5.7">about two weeks or so it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="371.01" dur="5.46">year now so we can tell and I&amp;#39;ve set</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="5.13">this over and over and over government</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="6.03">officials will always tell you the</text>
  <text start="379.26" dur="4.86">opposite of what is going on I mean we</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="3.479">see this in France they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="4.019">that everything is getting better what</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re on their way for a recovery we</text>
  <text start="388.139" dur="5.241">see this in Spain and yesterday I</text>
  <text start="389.729" dur="7.5">mentioned the mortgage the housing is</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="6.19">declining and collapsing and now what</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;re seeing in Spain we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.8">spat the Spanish sovereign bond spreads</text>
  <text start="402" dur="5.37">have collapsed this week to their lowest</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="5.37">in 30 months</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="4.29">and we can see that things are not going</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="6.27">well and the labor market situation is</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="7.44">still very poor we&amp;#39;re looking at 25 to</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="6.57">26 percent unemployment at this time and</text>
  <text start="419.1" dur="8.819">things are not getting better in Spain</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="8.88">and we&amp;#39;re also seeing that bad loans in</text>
  <text start="427.919" dur="6.421">Spain are actually on the rise they are</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="5.76">not falling they are rising so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="5.37">seeing many many situations and many</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="5.22">indicators that are showing us that</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="6.269">things are not going well here in the</text>
  <text start="442.44" dur="6.62">States we are saying that consumer</text>
  <text start="445.979" dur="5.821">confidence fell sharply in October as</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="5.74">consumers turn gloomier in their outlook</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="5.94">for the future and we can see this by</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="7.589">retail sales I mean consumer attitudes</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="8.61">drop from 270 one-point-two percent they</text>
  <text start="462.389" dur="6.9">were expecting 75 but now they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="466.35" dur="8.069">that it&amp;#39;s only 71 we are seeing mainly</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="9.451">many major corporations laying off the</text>
  <text start="474.419" dur="7.47">latest one and I would say maybe six</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="5.76">reports ago maybe a week or two weeks</text>
  <text start="481.889" dur="3.96">ago I reported that Reuters was laying</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="2.76">off and they would be laying off for</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="4.591">what like five to seven hundred people</text>
  <text start="487.26" dur="8.43">well guess what now it&amp;#39;s up to 4,500</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="7.949">people into 2014 so we are seeing</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="4.65">layoffs all over the place we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="498.389" dur="3.481">them in Wells Fargo Citibank Bank of</text>

  <text start="501.87" dur="5.729">layoffs we&amp;#39;re seeing in Reuters and if</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="5.521">we go back in time we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>

  <text start="573.96" dur="4.23">layoffs and you know when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="3.99">talking about oh the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="4.86">coming down this these numbers are</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="6.95">completely manipulated most of the jobs</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="8.25">that are being acquired right now are</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="6.67">part-time positions people who are</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="6.03">getting laid off from these full-time</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="6.24">corporate positions need to go out now</text>
  <text start="597.33" dur="6.96">and find one or two or three part-time</text>
  <text start="600.03" dur="6.81">positions and they cannot even make what</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="4.35">they were making before and we can see</text>
  <text start="606.84" dur="4.86">this because if they&amp;#39;re and I mentioned</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="5.73">this yesterday if their numbers are true</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="7.53">and unemployment has continually come</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="6.42">down back in 2011 back in 2012 and here</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="5.37">we are in 2013 now the unemployment</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="5.7">slower than it was back then right we</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="3.57">would think that retail sales were</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="5.07">getting better and I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="628.17" dur="6.78">yesterday but why are retail sales worse</text>
  <text start="631.56" dur="5.49">now than they were when unemployment was</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="6.51">higher back in twenty twelve and twenty</text>
  <text start="637.05" dur="6.36">eleven it makes no sense whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="641.46" dur="4.25">they we understand that they count</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="4.65">part-time jobs but guess what a</text>
  <text start="645.71" dur="4.48">part-time job is not the same as a</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="4.83">full-time job you do not make the same</text>
  <text start="650.19" dur="4.47">amount of money so yes someone might be</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="4.23">employed but instead of bringing in</text>
  <text start="654.66" dur="4.95">60,000 they&amp;#39;re bringing in 30,000 and</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="5.04">guess what they are not spending their</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="5.22">money like they did on retail and this</text>
  <text start="662.16" dur="6.93">is why we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of numbers in</text>

  <text start="822.509" dur="4.97">for the retail industry it just does not</text>
  <text start="825.089" dur="6.12">look good and again it goes hand in hand</text>

  <text start="831.209" dur="6.75">full-time jobs these people do not have</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="7.219">disposable income to go out and purchase</text>

  <text start="855.6" dur="7.709">stores closed after the holiday season</text>

  <text start="863.309" dur="8.101">the u.s. government bailed out General</text>
  <text start="866.579" dur="7.67">Motors and Chrysler and right now they</text>

  <text start="885.809" dur="5.19">even make their sales quota here in the</text>
  <text start="888.569" dur="5.64">states and again you have to think why</text>
  <text start="890.999" dur="5.46">can&amp;#39;t they do this because the American</text>
  <text start="894.209" dur="4.891">people are tapped out most of the</text>

  <text start="905.939" dur="5.01">not making the income day you step they</text>
  <text start="908.339" dur="4.71">used to be making and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="910.949" dur="3.6">seeing this and this is why they had to</text>
  <text start="913.049" dur="2.49">say hold it we need to start doing</text>

  <text start="925.109" dur="4.89">see all around and everything and if we</text>
  <text start="928.139" dur="3.9">just take a look and we look around the</text>
  <text start="929.999" dur="4.83">world and we look within our country and</text>
  <text start="932.039" dur="6.12">in our places I know where I am if I go</text>
  <text start="934.829" dur="6.281">to a plaza of stores I see many many</text>
  <text start="938.159" dur="8.471">empty spaces and let me just tell you</text>
  <text start="941.11" dur="8.82">back in the early you know 2005-6 this</text>
  <text start="946.63" dur="6.93">was all filled up with stores the I</text>

  <text start="962.11" dur="7.409">more of this okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="967.48" dur="5.46">if we look around the United States and</text>
  <text start="969.519" dur="6.121">we look at the cities that are right on</text>
  <text start="972.94" dur="5.61">the edge of collapse and we look at the</text>
  <text start="975.64" dur="6.06">amount of cash that they have on hand we</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="6.06">will see that if something would to</text>
  <text start="981.7" dur="4.59">occur they would not be able to pay</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="3.87">their bills and if we look at South</text>
  <text start="986.29" dur="5.37">Carolina they have zero days with cash</text>
  <text start="988.48" dur="6.12">on hand we look at Pomona California 0</text>

  <text start="1064.98" dur="6.329">well the less the population a city has</text>
  <text start="1068.669" dur="5.461">the less property tax the less income</text>
  <text start="1071.309" dur="3.731">the less sales tax to be collected so</text>
  <text start="1074.13" dur="3.04">again</text>

  <text start="2131.18" dur="4.41">all been located they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="2133.1" dur="5.85">dismantled and destroyed and what has</text>
  <text start="2135.59" dur="5.58">happened is rebels just conducted a new</text>
  <text start="2138.95" dur="4.619">chemical weapons attack</text>
  <text start="2141.17" dur="6.21">near the Turkish border and people have</text>
  <text start="2143.569" dur="6.961">seen a toxic yellow smoke that followed</text>
  <text start="2147.38" dur="5.729">an explosion and this chemical attack</text>
  <text start="2150.53" dur="5.49">came from the paid mercenaries and the</text>
  <text start="2153.109" dur="6.45">rebels at this time so this just shows</text>
  <text start="2156.02" dur="6.779">you they do have chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="2159.559" dur="5.881">because Assad right now he&amp;#39;s not even in</text>
  <text start="2162.799" dur="5.731">charge of his chemical weapons or his um</text>
  <text start="2165.44" dur="6.389">his areas these are all under control of</text>
  <text start="2168.53" dur="6.299">the UN at this time and we can see that</text>
  <text start="2171.829" dur="6.27">this whole August false flag was just</text>
  <text start="2174.829" dur="6.871">that a false flag event to get the war</text>
  <text start="2178.099" dur="6.781">started in Syria and right now we are</text>
  <text start="2181.7" dur="7.83">seeing claims that the Syrian electronic</text>
  <text start="2184.88" dur="8.64">army hacked into Obama&amp;#39;s Twitter account</text>
  <text start="2189.53" dur="6.779">Facebook account and started changing</text>
  <text start="2193.52" dur="6.27">things around and all the links that a</text>
  <text start="2196.309" dur="5.431">Barack Obama account in in the Twitter</text>
  <text start="2199.79" dur="4.11">and on Facebook were redirected to a</text>
  <text start="2201.74" dur="6.03">video showing the truth about Syria</text>
  <text start="2203.9" dur="5.969">again from any type of cyber attack it</text>
  <text start="2207.77" dur="4.44">is very very difficult to find out who</text>
  <text start="2209.869" dur="4.141">actually did this and it seems like</text>
  <text start="2212.21" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re building up the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="2214.01" dur="5.25">the Syrian electronic army has</text>
  <text start="2216.38" dur="6.36">technology now that can do much more</text>
  <text start="2219.26" dur="5.64">damage than they originally thought and</text>
  <text start="2222.74" dur="5.339">they&amp;#39;re continually you know pumping up</text>
  <text start="2224.9" dur="6.98">this propaganda and here we see again</text>
  <text start="2228.079" dur="6.121">that the Nasdaq had another glitch</text>
  <text start="2231.88" dur="5.89">something is definitely happening and</text>
  <text start="2234.2" dur="5.94">the system was pretty much down and it</text>
  <text start="2237.77" dur="4.38">was not working and they resumed trading</text>
  <text start="2240.14" dur="3.62">again but we&amp;#39;re seeing many of these</text>
  <text start="2242.15" dur="4.98">glitches and we&amp;#39;ve seen these glitches</text>
  <text start="2243.76" dur="6.099">throughout the internet on many various</text>
  <text start="2247.13" dur="5.16">sites and from all over the place and</text>
  <text start="2249.859" dur="5.51">Israel now is saying that they were just</text>
  <text start="2252.29" dur="6.809">hit by a Chinese very sophisticated</text>
  <text start="2255.369" dur="5.861">cyber attack Israel has determined that</text>
  <text start="2259.099" dur="4.74">China contributed to a major cyber type</text>
  <text start="2261.23" dur="4.71">of targeted defense industry again you</text>
  <text start="2263.839" dur="5.641">cannot tell exactly where a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2265.94" dur="6.27">occurs because professional and very</text>
  <text start="2269.48" dur="5.309">sophisticated hackers bounce it off many</text>
  <text start="2272.21" dur="4.349">different servers and all you can see</text>
  <text start="2274.789" dur="4.621">the last server they bounce it off of</text>
  <text start="2276.559" dur="8.071">and again they&amp;#39;re building up the</text>
  <text start="2279.41" dur="6.72">propaganda to China right now and this</text>
  <text start="2284.63" dur="3.119">is why the u.s. is building up the</text>
  <text start="2286.13" dur="4.02">propaganda Israel&amp;#39;s building up the</text>
  <text start="2287.749" dur="5.52">propaganda and Israel&amp;#39;s also coming out</text>
  <text start="2290.15" dur="6.029">and saying that they reported a major</text>
  <text start="2293.269" dur="5.4">cyber threat from Iran official said</text>
  <text start="2296.179" dur="4.77">Iran has directed Hamas and Hezbollah to</text>
  <text start="2298.669" dur="5.58">target Israelis infrastructure including</text>
  <text start="2300.949" dur="6.27">water power and train networks and you</text>
  <text start="2304.249" dur="5.37">might even see something occur and this</text>
  <text start="2307.219" dur="4.14">could be some type of false flag because</text>
  <text start="2309.619" dur="4.74">they would consider this an act of war</text>
  <text start="2311.359" dur="6.36">and this would give Israel the ability</text>
  <text start="2314.359" dur="5.73">to attack Iran because you know the</text>
  <text start="2317.719" dur="4.47">central bankers US government Israel</text>
  <text start="2320.089" dur="4.74">Saudi Arabia all want to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="2322.189" dur="4.62">and Syria and replace the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2324.829" dur="3.571">and put the puppet governments in there</text>
  <text start="2326.809" dur="5.78">and put the US dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="2328.4" dur="7.159">currency to keep the system propped up</text>
  <text start="2332.589" dur="8.65">now we do understand come this friday</text>
  <text start="2335.559" dur="7.99">the food stamp program EBT is going to</text>
  <text start="2341.239" dur="6.12">be reduced for many many people and</text>
  <text start="2343.549" dur="7.29">people are very worried about riots in</text>
  <text start="2347.359" dur="7.23">the area and the nationwide cut is</text>
  <text start="2350.839" dur="6.63">equivalent to about 16 meals a month for</text>
  <text start="2354.589" dur="5.46">a family of three and if you look across</text>
  <text start="2357.469" dur="5.37">the world riots always begin typically</text>
  <text start="2360.049" dur="8.341">the same way when people kind of can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2362.839" dur="9.6">afford to eat and the fact is that doing</text>
  <text start="2368.39" dur="8.909">this a family will go an entire week</text>
  <text start="2372.439" dur="6.66">without food each month and i know from</text>
  <text start="2377.299" dur="5.19">reports and from what people have told</text>
  <text start="2379.099" dur="6.96">me is that the EBT the food stamp money</text>
  <text start="2382.489" dur="5.28">only lasts them about three weeks into</text>
  <text start="2386.059" dur="4.05">the month or sometimes two weeks so</text>
  <text start="2387.769" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="2390.109" dur="6.09">are going hungry that are going to be</text>
  <text start="2392.539" dur="7.08">very angry and we could see major major</text>
  <text start="2396.199" dur="6.33">riots and we have to think that the</text>
  <text start="2399.619" dur="6.3">government is giving billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="2402.529" dur="6.251">to Saudi Arabia billions of dollars to</text>
  <text start="2405.919" dur="5.911">Israel billions of dollars in the m</text>
  <text start="2408.78" dur="6.81">and billions of dollars in all the other</text>
  <text start="2411.83" dur="7.66">Pakistan and Turkey but they cut here in</text>
  <text start="2415.59" dur="6">the US the food stamp program it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="2419.49" dur="5.97">I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the senators</text>
  <text start="2421.59" dur="6.54">representatives the president cut any of</text>
  <text start="2425.46" dur="5.97">their salaries I didn&amp;#39;t see any of them</text>
  <text start="2428.13" dur="6.81">go on to Obamacare I didn&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="2431.43" dur="8.48">them make any sacrifices whatsoever I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2434.94" dur="9.33">sorry a strong leader of the people</text>
  <text start="2439.91" dur="7.75">always sacrifices first to show that you</text>
  <text start="2444.27" dur="6.81">know what I am with you i will take the</text>
  <text start="2447.66" dur="5.88">cut I don&amp;#39;t need my 500,000 my two</text>
  <text start="2451.08" dur="4.29">hundred thousand dollar salary plus all</text>
  <text start="2453.54" dur="6.06">my investment income which I&amp;#39;m making</text>
  <text start="2455.37" dur="6.84">1.2 million i will decrease I will</text>
  <text start="2459.6" dur="4.8">sacrifice for the people and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2462.21" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m here but you can see from the</text>
  <text start="2464.4" dur="5.94">leaders they do not do this and this</text>
  <text start="2467.61" dur="5.37">brings up another point they love their</text>
  <text start="2470.34" dur="6.93">power they do not want to give it up so</text>
  <text start="2472.98" dur="8.28">what is happening they have DHS right</text>
  <text start="2477.27" dur="8.85">now and we can understand why DHS has</text>
  <text start="2481.26" dur="6.93">been created and for years DHS has been</text>
  <text start="2486.12" dur="3.81">simulating the collapse of the US</text>
  <text start="2488.19" dur="5.97">financial system they have been</text>
  <text start="2489.93" dur="5.88">preparing for internal riots they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2494.16" dur="5.73">been training for this they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="2495.81" dur="6.48">simulations for this and they have</text>
  <text start="2499.89" dur="4.92">concluded that any breakdown which</text>
  <text start="2502.29" dur="4.5">leaves people without money food or</text>
  <text start="2504.81" dur="4.47">access to government support will lead</text>
  <text start="2506.79" dur="5.46">to widespread violence looting and riots</text>
  <text start="2509.28" dur="5.46">on the streets of America the control</text>
  <text start="2512.25" dur="5.28">grid has put into place to handle what</text>
  <text start="2514.74" dur="5.34">they know is coming and they spend</text>
  <text start="2517.53" dur="7.29">billions of dollars on food guns</text>
  <text start="2520.08" dur="6.42">ammunition armored tanks to control the</text>
  <text start="2524.82" dur="5.31">population and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="2526.5" dur="5.43">government looks like they want some</text>
  <text start="2530.13" dur="4.17">type of writing they tried to do this</text>
  <text start="2531.93" dur="5.25">with the Trayvon Martin by building a</text>
  <text start="2534.3" dur="6.27">race riot type of scenario but that</text>
  <text start="2537.18" dur="5.07">never really happened but they pushed it</text>
  <text start="2540.57" dur="3.99">as far as they could</text>
  <text start="2542.25" dur="6.6">and now here we are with people that are</text>
  <text start="2544.56" dur="5.94">going to go hungry and you can see why</text>
  <text start="2548.85" dur="3.63">they want this to happen because it</text>
  <text start="2550.5" dur="4.08">would be a lot easier for the Obama</text>
  <text start="2552.48" dur="5.34">administration to declare martial</text>
  <text start="2554.58" dur="5.55">martial law and to take power into his</text>
  <text start="2557.82" dur="4.71">own hands instead of dealing with</text>
  <text start="2560.13" dur="6.35">Congress and dealing with other people</text>
  <text start="2562.53" dur="6.45">and just lock down the entire country</text>
