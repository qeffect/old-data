  <text start="93.95" dur="5.16">the Fed and getting the people to</text>
  <text start="96.61" dur="6.31">realize that when the Fed raises the</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="6.63">rates things start to fall apart then we</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="5.55">had the Fed appear on 60 minutes telling</text>

  <text start="108.47" dur="6.84">employment rate and keeping the banks</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="5.76">stable and keeping prices stable and of</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="6.81">course this appeared on a mainstream</text>
  <text start="117.65" dur="6.18">media outlet station on a show and it</text>
  <text start="122.12" dur="5.19">was broadcasted to millions and millions</text>
  <text start="123.83" dur="6.539">of people and again when things go south</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="4.77">this could be replayed over and over and</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="5.34">over saying that they are responsible</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="5.519">for this Trump has been showing the</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="4.071">world through these statistical</text>
  <text start="137.599" dur="5.22">information that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="6.58">absolutely fantastically and we know</text>
  <text start="142.819" dur="7.2">from the real numbers that the economy</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="6.69">never got any better since Obama</text>
  <text start="150.019" dur="4.741">actually was deteriorating since we came</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="3.659">off the goal to actually if you go back</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="5.009">even further as soon as the central bank</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="4.831">took control we knew the economy was not</text>
  <text start="159.769" dur="4.261">going to do well at all this was back in</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="4.74">1913 now we were on</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="5.91">some type of gold standard during the</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="5.7">period of 1913 all the way up to the 70s</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="3.75">but we came off the gold standard in the</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.8">70s which allowed the central banks to</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="8.19">create currency like crazy and since</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="7.5">that time well the entire system started</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="5.55">to implode you didn&amp;#39;t notice it in the</text>
  <text start="184.28" dur="6.3">beginning but you notice it now so Trump</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="5.55">has to educate the American public what</text>
  <text start="190.58" dur="4.29">the Federal Reserve really is and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="3.69">be getting into that in just a moment</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="4.2">but when we start to look at these</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="5.01">numbers here and we start to look at the</text>
  <text start="199.07" dur="4.68">reports on how the economy is actually</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="4.02">doing I&amp;#39;m not talking about Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="5.4">unemployment numbers the stock market</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="5.88">GDP numbers these numbers are for all</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="4.5">those people who are sleeping it&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="4.739">the mainstream media it&amp;#39;s for the</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="5.79">central bank so none of these outfits</text>
  <text start="216.319" dur="6.031">can question what he&amp;#39;s doing because</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s using their weapon against them but</text>
  <text start="222.35" dur="4.109">if you go beyond this and you start to</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.649">really look at what&amp;#39;s going on you can</text>
  <text start="226.459" dur="6.03">see the central bank was not a benefit</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="5.521">to the American people if you look at</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="4.651">the Millennial Generation they are</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="5.13">deeper in debt than any other generation</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="4.59">has come before them and coming out of</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="4.59">the New York Federal Reserve if you</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="6.36">notice they always keep tabs the central</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="5.67">bank&amp;#39;s on debt they&amp;#39;ve revealed in a</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="7.019">report that Millennials have now racked</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="7.529">up over 1 trillion dollars of debt now</text>
  <text start="255.109" dur="5.671">this is a troubling amount of debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="7.441">an increase of over 22% in just five</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="7.77">years and like we said before it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="265.4" dur="6.3">than any other generation in history so</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="5.25">how did it get this bad is it because of</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="2.7">credit cards well that&amp;#39;s part of it but</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="2.88">not really</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="4.47">many of the Millennials who are out</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.13">there don&amp;#39;t have the high paying jobs a</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="6.09">lot of them have cut back on what they</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="7.95">can spend and a lot of them don&amp;#39;t own a</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="7.8">house so why are they so in debt well</text>
  <text start="289.76" dur="7.27">it&amp;#39;s student loans the student loan debt</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="7.81">is incredibly high the latest</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="6.18">loan debt statistics for 2019 show how</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="4.34">serious the student loan debt crisis has</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.86">become for borrowers across all</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="5.38">demographics and age groups there are</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="4.92">more than 44 million borrowers who</text>
  <text start="310.29" dur="5.91">collectively owe 1.5 trillion in student</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="5.91">loan debt in the US alone student loan</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="6">debt is now the second highest consumer</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="5.91">debt category behind only two mortgages</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="5.88">and higher them both credit cards and</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="6.09">auto loans and you cannot default on the</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="5.69">student loan you have to pay it back</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="6.18">well you can default there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="333.77" dur="5.35">circumstances but for the most part you</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="4.44">really can&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;ll always hold you to</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="5.01">it and if you try to default without</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="4.05">having a really good reason and they</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="5.7">have a list of all the different reasons</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="7.95">you can&amp;#39;t get a loan anywhere else your</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="6.39">credit is kind of shot so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="4.62">seeing right now is that generation</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="5.67">after generation has just gotten worse</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="6.8">and worse and worse and Trump what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="5.58">doing right now he is reversing</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="4.81">everything the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep</text>
  <text start="367.47" dur="5.16">state have been doing for a very long</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="5.31">time putting our country further and</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.08">further into debt now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="5.52">are out there saying well he&amp;#39;s racking</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="7.23">up a lot of debt - yes he&amp;#39;s using the</text>

  <text start="387.23" dur="6.46">bring back everything that they pushed</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="5.61">away think about it for a second how</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.76">would you do it if you know that the</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="5.28">system is going to implode you know that</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="4.53">this system will cannot last that much</text>
