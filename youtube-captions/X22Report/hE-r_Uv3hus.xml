  <text start="100.46" dur="7.17">amazing now an interesting story where</text>
  <text start="104.51" dur="7.98">the Pope blasts global financial system</text>
  <text start="107.63" dur="6.42">as cult of money and basically Pope</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="3.78">Francis has denounced the global</text>

  <text start="121.36" dur="9.61">sizing the poor and turning humans into</text>
  <text start="124.96" dur="10.21">expendable consumer goods and basically</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="5.849">we should go on this and investigate</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="3.75">these central bankers I mean this</text>
  <text start="136.819" dur="3.87">central bankers tell us that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="3.569">a government agency they&amp;#39;re not part of</text>
  <text start="140.689" dur="3.481">any government they are privately held</text>
  <text start="142.489" dur="4.22">corporation so maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="6.899">maybe we should need a we should issue a</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="7.241">a warrant and go in and seize their</text>
  <text start="151.069" dur="5.881">records and see what type of business</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="5.78">they&amp;#39;re doing just like with any other</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="5.28">company who is holding them accountable</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="4.989">nobody so if they&amp;#39;re just a corporation</text>
  <text start="162.23" dur="6.119">let&amp;#39;s go in there and see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.719" dur="5.55">doing why are they above the law they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.349" dur="6.84">just a corporation let&amp;#39;s go in and take</text>
  <text start="170.269" dur="8.881">a look now in I think this was in zero</text>
  <text start="175.189" dur="7.92">heads the gold demand is definitely</text>
  <text start="179.15" dur="6">different between physical and ETF and</text>
  <text start="183.109" dur="6.21">you can definitely see the difference</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="9.03">there is a chart on my site where paper</text>
  <text start="189.319" dur="7.37">demand is in the 1st quarter of 2013 is</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="6.509">down like a negative hundred and fifteen</text>
  <text start="196.689" dur="8.741">150 tons and physical demand in tons is</text>
  <text start="200.689" dur="8.16">almost close to let&amp;#39;s say about 380 tons</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="7.259">so it looks like the physical and the</text>
  <text start="208.849" dur="5.85">paper markets are separating and you can</text>
  <text start="212.689" dur="4.44">see this in the graph of this is the</text>
  <text start="214.699" dur="9.051">first time where they&amp;#39;re both going the</text>
  <text start="217.129" dur="10.26">opposite direction now moving on Israel</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="6.519">hints at new strikes warning Syria not</text>
  <text start="227.389" dur="4.74">to hit back now we know that the</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="4.14">government&amp;#39;s central bankers need to</text>
  <text start="232.129" dur="6.54">start the wars and Israel&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="234.409" dur="6.091">anything and everything to get Syria to</text>
  <text start="238.669" dur="4.081">strike back they&amp;#39;re going to continually</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="4.349">provoke provoke provoke until they do</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="4.769">something where they can say oh my god</text>
  <text start="244.849" dur="4.89">they attacked us it&amp;#39;s an all-out war and</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="4.291">basically that&amp;#39;s what this is for and</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="5.131">this also goes back to Senate resolution</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="5.549">number 65 that if Israel is in a war</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="5.099">with Iran the United States will go in</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="4.5">and help and join the war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.969" dur="4.831">basically what that is and we on the war</text>
  <text start="261.859" dur="4.381">front you can see the g japan&amp;#39;s prime</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="4.799">minister warns of possible military</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.47">response to chinese subs and it looks</text>
  <text start="269.599" dur="4.531">like that is</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="6.15">heating up and also Russian Pacific</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="4.83">Fleet warships enter Mediterranean for</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="4.55">the first time in decades and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="4.74">going to park in Cyprus so it looks like</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="4.39">the United States is there with their</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="4.95">fleet Russia is there with their fleet</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="5.43">and this is no coincidence this is not</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="5.61">just like hey how you doing we are there</text>
  <text start="291.23" dur="7.2">for one reason only and they are there</text>

  <text start="298.43" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s going to be happening and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="5.64">just getting prepared that is the only</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.92">reason why we have all our ships over</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="4.05">there not all of them but most of our</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="6.06">ships over there and running these</text>

  <text start="463.31" dur="7.97">prosecution the proposed bill states so</text>
  <text start="466.64" dur="8.07">basically they are looking to confiscate</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="7.18">the guns and there are some reasons I</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="6.39">mean some facts that this is all they</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="4.41">want to do nothing else has nothing to</text>

  <text start="485" dur="7.14">know is they&amp;#39;ve been basically mandated</text>
  <text start="488" dur="7.169">to get the guns now another interesting</text>
  <text start="492.14" dur="5.46">article and this is the US military</text>
  <text start="495.169" dur="4.891">power grab goes into effect bent</text>

  <text start="500.06" dur="8.15">authority over civil disturbances and</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="10.75">basically what this goes on to say is</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="8.74">basically making some few subtle changes</text>
  <text start="513.71" dur="4.889">to a regulation in the u.s. code title</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="4.019">defense support of civilian law</text>

  <text start="530.48" dur="6.24">allowed to go in you say it also says</text>
  <text start="535.19" dur="3.43">the most objectionable aspects of the</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="4.15">regulatory change is the inclusion of</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="4.41">vague language that permits the military</text>
  <text start="540.87" dur="4.83">intervention in the event of a civil</text>
  <text start="543.03" dur="4.59">disturbances according to the rule so</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="4.41">basically they can just go in and</text>
  <text start="547.62" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re saying that they can take over</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="6.24">whenever they feel it&amp;#39;s necessary of</text>

  <text start="558.39" dur="4.44">but you know what is the definition of</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="7.85">that who declares that and basically</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="7.62">this is a very very telling type of law</text>
  <text start="568.13" dur="6.15">that gives them permission to do</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="9.42">something and it really shows that</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="8.74">martial law police state is definitely</text>
  <text start="579.87" dur="5.94">coming because not just with this but</text>

  <text start="792.62" dur="5.83">something else is coming now the Fed</text>
  <text start="796.14" dur="6.21">came out and remember what I always say</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="6.41">it&amp;#39;s always the opposite of what the</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="4.94">government or the Fed says</text>
  <text start="804.86" dur="6">and basically the Fed keeps on hinting</text>
  <text start="807.29" dur="6">that they&amp;#39;re going to stop QE and there</text>
  <text start="810.86" dur="4.86">is no way that they are going to be able</text>
  <text start="813.29" dur="4.32">to stop QE well there is one way when</text>
  <text start="815.72" dur="5.43">the economic collapse happens I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="5.85">believe only QA q e anymore and that you</text>
  <text start="821.15" dur="6.86">know they continually are hinting that</text>
  <text start="823.46" dur="7.68">the Fed may reduce QE in the summer and</text>
  <text start="828.01" dur="5.41">I don&amp;#39;t know if this is a misprint and</text>
  <text start="831.14" dur="4.56">it says this in the article that the</text>
  <text start="833.42" dur="6.63">unemployment employment wait won&amp;#39;t fall</text>
  <text start="835.7" dur="11.55">below 6.5 until mid 20 10 5 or do they</text>
  <text start="840.05" dur="13.53">mean 2015 but you know but you know they</text>
  <text start="847.25" dur="11.18">go on to say that that basically that QE</text>
  <text start="853.58" dur="4.85">wouldn&amp;#39;t mean tightening in policy I</text>
  <text start="858.52" dur="4.54">mean slowing of QE wouldn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="861.38" dur="4.34">tightening and policy so basically</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re just letting this out letting</text>
  <text start="865.72" dur="5.32">the investors know and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="869.03" dur="3.9">make it seem like everything is getting</text>
  <text start="871.04" dur="4.35">better and they&amp;#39;re going to be pulling</text>
  <text start="872.93" dur="6.32">this back and we have to remember to go</text>

  <text start="886.01" dur="6.15">subprime is contained everything that</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="5.07">they say is always the opposite so</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re going to continue QE or probably</text>
  <text start="894.5" dur="5.13">even ramp it up that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m figuring</text>
  <text start="898.37" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m getting out of this</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="7.47">because there is no way that they will</text>
  <text start="902.63" dur="6.56">be able to stop QE at all now if I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.1" dur="5.61">know if you got a chance to look at the</text>
  <text start="909.19" dur="4.9">john stossel illegal everything and he</text>
