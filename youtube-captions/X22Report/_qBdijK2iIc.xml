  <text start="174.58" dur="5.159">they started to decline at the same time</text>
  <text start="177.13" dur="4.68">this was back at the end of two thousand</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="4.591">six going into 2007 and</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="4.52">here we are once again where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="3.96">seeing the same exact pattern and</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="4.989">they&amp;#39;re starting to head in the same</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="6.33">exact direction and that is downward</text>
  <text start="191.319" dur="7.831">which tells us that we are headed</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="6.51">towards a another recession collapse</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="4.23">type of scenario now we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="5.07">many different indicators the Fed labor</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="5.79">market index is telling us that we are</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="5.49">in a recession we&amp;#39;re looking at retail</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="4.98">sales which shows us that the holiday</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="5.28">season was a complete bust we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="7.74">that Walmart they&amp;#39;re cutting hundreds of</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="6.09">jobs before the end of January and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="2.909">seeing that the limited is gonna be</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="3.149">laying off four thousand people I mean</text>
  <text start="224.799" dur="3">think about what&amp;#39;s happening now and</text>
  <text start="226.209" dur="3.901">think about the number of stores that</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="5.461">have closed and let&amp;#39;s go back a couple</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="7.14">of years where we&amp;#39;ve seen the holiday</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="5.759">season in the same way where we come out</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="3.81">of the holiday season Black Friday Cyber</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="3.931">Monday wasn&amp;#39;t that great and we come</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="3.81">into the new year and we see all these</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="4.77">store closings and all these layoffs I</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="6.69">mean we saw this in 2014 we saw it pick</text>
  <text start="247.72" dur="7.32">up in 2015 and here we are again in 2016</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="6.06">and you can&amp;#39;t really argue anymore that</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.4">the retail industry is doing well</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="4.859">because we&amp;#39;re seeing many individuals</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="4.53">being laid off many stores closing and</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="5.701">the online sales they&amp;#39;re not out there</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="6.81">saying online sales have completely</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="7.2">surged to new heights and all these</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="5.94">stores are going to online why wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="5.15">they do that no instead they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.77">completely bankrupt out of business</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="4.47">because you have to remember all these</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.46">stores they have an online presence</text>
  <text start="285" dur="7.3">people can purchase online from all of</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="7.14">these stores it&amp;#39;s not just one place but</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="7.35">we&amp;#39;re not seeing that what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="10.079">seeing is the destruction the the</text>
  <text start="299.65" dur="10.53">implosion of retail why why are we</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="7.801">seeing this because when people lose</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="5.21">their jobs when people get part-time</text>
  <text start="312.97" dur="5.36">jobs and they don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="315.39" dur="6.45">the money they&amp;#39;re not secure in their</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="6.09">livelihoods they don&amp;#39;t spend money this</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="6.3">is the biggest problem the central banks</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="6.6">have yes they can create money by</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="4.47">pushing a button yes they can give the</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="3.78">free money to the banks and tell them to</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="4.89">prop up the stock market yes they can</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.51">have the plunge protection team keep the</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="7.92">stock market up never let it come down</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="9.94">yes they can create currency and give</text>
  <text start="345.42" dur="6.93">the Japan then have the ECB do it they</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="5.46">can buy up corporate bonds they can buy</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="8.87">up Treasuries the one problem they have</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="10.35">is to convince people to spend their</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="7.96">currency especially when individuals are</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="7.23">losing jobs and people don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="6.45">confident in the economy and this is the</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="3.84">major problem because when the gasoline</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="2.73">prices came down they really thought</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="3.24">that people are going to take this extra</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="4.41">money and go out and spend like crazy it</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="4.89">didn&amp;#39;t happen they&amp;#39;re trying the</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="5.16">universal basic income in Finland where</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to give everyone currency</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="3.21">and they&amp;#39;re hoping that everyone&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="4.38">to take this and go spend it in the</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="5.37">economy well for those people who have</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="5.46">been living day to day not making enough</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="6.87">money barely getting by this extra money</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="5.4">is so they can just survive the extra</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="3.36">money is not going to make them feel</text>
  <text start="404.76" dur="3.39">confident that oh wow I have an extra</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="4.29">four hundred dollars let me go out and</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="4.86">spend this on a new TV on a new whatever</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="4.76">they&amp;#39;re not going to do it they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="6.03">to keep it because they understand and</text>
  <text start="415.79" dur="5.62">they realize they they&amp;#39;re not confident</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="5.79">in their situation they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="6">high paying job not like they used to</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="6.63">and this is something the central bank</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="6.42">is trying to figure out on how they can</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="5.09">get people to spend in the economy</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="5.55">because remember spending in retail</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="6.85">makes up what sixty seventy percent of</text>
  <text start="439.38" dur="5.04">GDP and it&amp;#39;s just not there the spending</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="3.18">that we&amp;#39;re seeing today that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="4.38">reporting on that&amp;#39;s in health insurance</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="5.339">that&amp;#39;s because of Obamacare that&amp;#39;s big</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="9.44">as a premiums continually rising it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="9.331">illusion we see host sale glove ll sales</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="5.26">they have disappointed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.65">sending inventory ratios back into</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="6.419">recession territory another indicator</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="7.65">that&amp;#39;s telling us that again we are in a</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="7.59">recession no November saw inventories</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="6.63">rise more than expected but sales they</text>
  <text start="477.509" dur="5.91">didn&amp;#39;t do too well and they were revised</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="6.419">lower this sent the inventories to sales</text>
  <text start="483.419" dur="6.541">ratio back up again which is now stuck</text>
  <text start="486.599" dur="7.981">in recessionary the recessionary area</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="6.75">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="494.58" dur="5.119">eight we&amp;#39;ve seen this back in two</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="8.85">thousand one and here we are again in</text>
  <text start="499.699" dur="10.451">the same area it&amp;#39;s telling us that we</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="9.06">are heading towards a recession now the</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="8.309">8i I be chief says listen the door is</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="5.94">still open for the u.s. to join and we</text>
  <text start="518.459" dur="4.38">know that the United States is one of</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="7.74">the only countries the debt actually</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="6.931">didn&amp;#39;t join in with the aiib is the</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="6.3">United States going to join right now</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="6.72">most likely not and what we&amp;#39;re seeing at</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="3.78">this point is the United States</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="7.77">government central bankers the central</text>
  <text start="538.38" dur="9.39">bank they are going to fight as hard as</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="5.55">they possibly can to keep this system</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="4.5">because they profit very well from it</text>
  <text start="549.81" dur="5.25">they can control other countries with it</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="8.1">and they don&amp;#39;t want to let any of this</text>
  <text start="555.06" dur="7.08">go and we can see right now that things</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="6.149">are rapidly deteriorating and falling</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="5.85">apart across the world and many people</text>
  <text start="566.519" dur="3.831">believe that well this can just can</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="5.07">continue on forever and ever and ever</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="6.52">well everyone always thought the same</text>
  <text start="573.06" dur="6.089">thing back in 2006-2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="4.19">everyone thought the same thing during</text>
  <text start="579.149" dur="3.461">the right before the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="5.63">remember</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="7.229">each period and each time we were coming</text>
  <text start="586.69" dur="6.12">off this incredible high where things</text>
  <text start="589.839" dur="9.571">were incredible everything was pushed up</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="8.19">the illusion was set and the central</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="5.51">bank and everyone made you feel like</text>
  <text start="601" dur="8.37">this can go on forever it will never end</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="7.75">but illusions always end one way or</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="7.07">another Ponzi schemes always end one way</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="6.72">or another they start out feeling good</text>
  <text start="616.44" dur="5.2">but eventually what happens is things</text>
  <text start="619.39" dur="4.86">rapidly deteriorate because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="621.64" dur="5.49">control everything they can control a</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="5.73">small aspect of what&amp;#39;s going on but they</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="5.639">can&amp;#39;t control everything like spending</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="5.7">very difficult to control that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.769" dur="5.76">going to try but it&amp;#39;s difficult to</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="5.61">control and what that tells you is that</text>
  <text start="638.529" dur="5.521">when people stop when people say you</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="5.489">know something I don&amp;#39;t feel confident I</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="5.909">don&amp;#39;t have the funds they stop buying</text>
  <text start="646.779" dur="6.441">real estate they don&amp;#39;t move into homes</text>
  <text start="649.959" dur="5.49">when the unuthul employment Rises and</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="4.63">you&amp;#39;re approaching twenty thirty forty</text>
  <text start="655.449" dur="5.461">percent well guess what the next</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="4.71">generation they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>

  <text start="668.35" dur="4.83">any of this and this is the part where</text>
  <text start="671.5" dur="3.36">the central banks are very nervous about</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="3.899">because they can&amp;#39;t control any of it and</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="4.08">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is as more</text>

  <text start="686.26" dur="5.21">all happening and why this is all</text>
  <text start="689.17" dur="4.95">happening is because we&amp;#39;re approaching a</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="6.88">complete and utter collapse of the</text>

  <text start="737.62" dur="7.06">they need to do this because once they</text>
  <text start="742.519" dur="6.271">bring it down they will point the finger</text>
  <text start="744.68" dur="7.339">they will have a villain and all the</text>
