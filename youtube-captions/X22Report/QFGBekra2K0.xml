  <text start="159.659" dur="5.011">watch what&amp;#39;s happening and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="161.219" dur="6.721">start to realize that they</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="5.25">have no hope and it&amp;#39;s all going to start</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="4.44">to happen for Trump and the Patriots the</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="4.319">deal will be made and all this talk</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="5.55">about recession and all this talk about</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="7.381">the trade war being the trigger point</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s all going to fall apart this is why</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="5.91">Trump has been out there pushing and</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="6.359">pointing the finger at the Fed he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="6.12">setting up the entire narrative so</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="6.511">everyone understands that it is the</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="7.22">central bank that is the problem now</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="8.1">chairman Powell he is saying that listen</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="7.149">we are going to start stimulus we know</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s going to happen in November he also</text>
  <text start="208.019" dur="4.981">said it is certainly possible that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="6">need to resume the organic growth of the</text>
  <text start="213" dur="4.98">balance sheet sooner than we thought so</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="4.29">what does that mean it means that</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re already doing it remember we</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="5.37">talked about how they were purchasing</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="6">bonds instead of unloading their balance</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="5.729">sheet right now we can see already</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re adding to it they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="5.22">expand the central bank&amp;#39;s balance sheet</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="7.11">through the outright purchases of US</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="7.231">Treasury securities to ensure stable</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="6.27">liquidity think about what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="8.22">here they&amp;#39;re doing exactly what Trump</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="8.31">wants and we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.19">since Trump has been pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.32">at the Fed and it started out very</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.859">slowly it started out where he said oh</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="5.25">the Fed should not raise the interest</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="5.311">rates they should stop raising them they</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="4.17">should hold them steady and then he went</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="3.3">on and say okay now that since they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="3.84">steady he should low they should lower</text>
  <text start="270.66" dur="4.29">the rates because look what other</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="4.62">countries are doing and they lowered it</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="3.779">by a quarter point Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.41">said listen we need to lowered her again</text>
  <text start="278.729" dur="4.771">and start stimulus and we can see every</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="5.25">time he comes out and he says something</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="5.61">they follow maybe a month maybe two</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="4.44">months maybe three months later remember</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.44">optics are very important it can&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="4.29">like Trump is bossing the Fed around</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="3.81">then the mainstream media would go crazy</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="2.31">the mainstream media would say hey look</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="2.76">the feds</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="4.23">independent we know from Judy Shelton</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="3.269">she&amp;#39;s already saying that maybe the Fed</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="5.73">in the White House they should work</text>
  <text start="303.389" dur="7.62">together this will happen later on but</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="9.27">what we see happening right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="311.009" dur="10.021">going to be using debt as his weapon the</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="6.569">Federal Reserve is going to take on more</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="5.13">debt they&amp;#39;re going to add to their</text>
  <text start="323.699" dur="5.641">balance sheet think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="6.6">happening here think about the world the</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="6">world is saturated with the central bank</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="6.779">debt and there are many countries out</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="7.71">there that how to implement austerity</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="7.201">and the central bank dictates to the</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="8.369">countries of what they need to do Trump</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="8.19">right now is going to be using debt to</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="5.641">push the central bank system over the</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="6.62">edge how would you destroy the central</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="8.34">bank well you would use their weapon</text>
  <text start="361.55" dur="7.36">against themselves think about how the</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="7.59">central bank system works as their</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="6.96">system moves forward and it comes to the</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="7.41">end stage of their system throughout</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="6.72">this time that is accumulated in every</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="3.989">single country q is showed us that</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s a sent a private western central</text>
  <text start="384.389" dur="3.931">bank system in almost every single one</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="3.929">of these countries then we have the IMF</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="3.569">then we have the ECB then we have the</text>
  <text start="390.449" dur="3.78">biz then we have the Ross trial banking</text>
  <text start="391.889" dur="7.5">system on top of all this but their</text>
  <text start="394.229" dur="9.141">entire product is debt and when the debt</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="8.821">load gets too heavy their entire scheme</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="6.97">starts to implode and they need a way</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="4.32">out this is why they look for a war an</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="4.35">event or something so this way it takes</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="5.43">all eyes off of what they&amp;#39;ve done to the</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="5.52">world and put it someplace else they</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t have that right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="5.55">telling the Federal Reserve that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="5.28">going to add more debt to the system</text>
  <text start="425.76" dur="4.93">you&amp;#39;re gonna take on more debt think</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="5.44">about this the world</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="5.46">has to do this how do you destroy them</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="6.27">if it&amp;#39;s imploding with what they have</text>
  <text start="436.15" dur="7.95">now if they add more debt it lets</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="8.25">everyone see exactly what this system</text>
  <text start="444.1" dur="7.86">does as these central banks add more</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="7.59">debt and continually add more and more</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="8.04">and more guess what happens the whole</text>
  <text start="455.89" dur="6.96">thing just completely implodes think</text>
  <text start="460" dur="5.25">about a balloon you add more air you add</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="7.38">more air it expands it expands expands</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="6.45">at some point it completely pops that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to the central</text>
  <text start="471.7" dur="7.77">bank and Trump is gonna continually push</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="6.12">the agenda until the very very end he</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="3.33">wants the people not just here in the</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="3.51">United States but around the world I</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.19">understand that it&amp;#39;s going to be the</text>
  <text start="485.11" dur="5.82">central bank that is responsible for all</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="4.77">of this he tweeted out the following go</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="3.63">across the world and you&amp;#39;ll see either</text>
  <text start="492.76" dur="3.63">very low interest rates or negative</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="4.23">rates the president wants to be</text>
  <text start="496.39" dur="5.25">competitive with these other countries</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="5.79">on this but I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;ll fire Jay</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="4.92">Powell even if I should we should always</text>
  <text start="504.58" dur="4.62">be paying less interest rates than</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="4.65">others now if the Fed lowers rates what</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="5.279">other countries do they have to lower</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="5.73">rates what happens next</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="6.75">they need stimulus they need to create</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="7.65">more debt Trump is driving the central</text>
  <text start="521.229" dur="6.711">banks around the world and he&amp;#39;s driving</text>
  <text start="524.59" dur="6.72">them right off and over the cliff and</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="6.04">like I said before in the beginning of a</text>
  <text start="531.31" dur="5.04">central bank system everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="6.18">fantastic why because you come off of a</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="6.03">gold standard and you see inflation like</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;ve never seen before which means</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="4.62">they hot they raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="544.12" dur="5.31">to control it all and people think this</text>
  <text start="547" dur="5.06">is fantastic while your house went from</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="5.7">five thousand to twenty thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="5.35">your salary went from three thousand</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="2.7">dollars a year to ten thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="557.41" dur="2.88">year</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="6.6">interest rates are at sixteen seventeen</text>
  <text start="560.29" dur="7.14">eighteen percent and your dollar value</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="7.41">suddenly drops but you don&amp;#39;t see that in</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="7.35">the beginning what you see is inflation</text>
  <text start="571.84" dur="5.25">where the value of your dollar drops</text>
  <text start="574.78" dur="4.8">which means you lead a lot more dollars</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="5.58">and people think oh my home price has</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="5.1">just gone up oh look I&amp;#39;m making more</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="3.96">money know what that really means is</text>
  <text start="584.68" dur="4.95">that your dollars worth less and they</text>
  <text start="586.63" dur="5.04">need more of those dollars to pay you</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="5.31">the same amount that you were actually</text>
  <text start="591.67" dur="6.42">making and if you&amp;#39;re holding gold</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="6.03">throughout this time gold holds its</text>
  <text start="598.09" dur="4.95">value as the dollar continually drops</text>
  <text start="600.97" dur="5.7">and what you&amp;#39;re at when you&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="8.25">end stage of a central bank system wages</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="6.21">drop hardly any inflation the interest</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="4.29">rates have to go really really low</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="4.11">because if you imagine if they took the</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="4.68">interest rates of that what we had in</text>
  <text start="616.99" dur="6.02">the 70s and and they took those interest</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="5.73">rates and use them today and made them</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="4.87">sixteen seventeen eighteen percent what</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="3.57">would happen to the system it would</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="3.21">implode the whole thing would just come</text>
  <text start="629.56" dur="3">to a screeching halt first of all we</text>
  <text start="631.09" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to pay the debt the</text>
  <text start="632.56" dur="6">national debt everyone that had a car</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="4.98">loan a home loan that was variable or</text>
  <text start="638.56" dur="6.54">trying to get in a student loan would</text>
  <text start="641.02" dur="5.64">anyone be able to function no this is</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="4.08">what it looks like at the end stage</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="5.19">everything is the opposite and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.18" dur="5.19">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and Trump is</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="5.43">going to use their weapon against them</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s been using everything against the</text>
  <text start="657.28" dur="4.02">mainstream media the central bank when</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="3.75">they talk about the stock market when</text>
