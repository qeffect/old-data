  <text start="157.39" dur="3.849">we know that the economy around the</text>
  <text start="160.19" dur="4.29">world not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="5.401">it is falling apart I mean if we go out</text>

  <text start="181.4" dur="4.03">11.8</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="4.41">and the consensus forecast thought that</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="3.84">the unemployment rate was going to be</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="4.56">around eleven point six percent but</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s even worse than that is that</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="7.039">youth unemployment rose to thirty nine</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="7.11">point four percent up from 37.6 percent</text>

  <text start="204.51" dur="4.83">the youth unemployment that is the next</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="5.459">generation think about what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="5.25">right now these young individuals they</text>
  <text start="212.489" dur="4.56">cannot find work they don&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="4.14">income coming in they&amp;#39;re not saving</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="3.481">money they can&amp;#39;t go out and purchase a</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="5.67">home they can&amp;#39;t go out and purchase a</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="8.76">car they can&amp;#39;t spend in retail this is</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="8.28">not a good sign for the next generation</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.009">which means the economy is not going to</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="3.809">do well and we see these high</text>
  <text start="234.299" dur="5.461">unemployment numbers not just in Italy</text>
  <text start="236.489" dur="6.181">we see it in France we see it in Greece</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="5.699">we see it in Cyprus we see it here in</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="6">the United States we see in many of the</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.701">countries and this is a huge huge</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="5.099">problem which means we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="6.359">running into problems very shortly worse</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="6.361">than we are right now the system will</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="6.181">not be able to sustain itself now Obama</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="7.2">is out there and he is claiming that he</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="4.98">created 9.9 million jobs and of course</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="4.11">the corporate media is playing this up</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="5.58">because it&amp;#39;s the last couple days of him</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="4.65">being in office and when we really look</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="4.17">at this and we look at the numbers that</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="5.79">were put out by the BLS we see that</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="5.94">Obama created 9.9 million jobs a lot of</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="8.7">them the majority of them are part-time</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="9.66">but 14.6 million left the labor force at</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="6.93">the same time and you know what that</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="8.609">means it means those individuals could</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="7.71">not find jobs they&amp;#39;ve been putting their</text>
  <text start="302.639" dur="4.621">resume out but they haven&amp;#39;t been on and</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="6.629">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview with in</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="6.87">four weeks which tells you that his</text>
  <text start="311.849" dur="3.991">recovery is not really recovery and</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="6.75">think about this</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="11.51">the labor force participation rate when</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="12.5">Obama was in office is now at sixty 2.7%</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="8.86">this is absolutely awful which means</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="7.27">they&amp;#39;re just not counting people to make</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="7.019">their numbers look much better and Jim</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="5">Clifton who is the chairman and CEO of</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="6.871">Gallup says the official rate is very</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="6.88">misleading and it is because when you</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="5.25">just hear those numbers you say wow he</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="7.859">created a 9.9 million but almost 15</text>
  <text start="355.35" dur="9.6">million they can&amp;#39;t find a job so really</text>
  <text start="360.389" dur="7.65">did he create 9.9 million jobs and what</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="6.81">type of jobs are they most of them are</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="6.451">part-time most of them are in the</text>
  <text start="371.76" dur="5.45">restaurant retail industry and those</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="6.299">people right now are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="6.85">we see during this holiday season the</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="7.201">feds revealed that Americans went on a</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="7.71">credit card funding shopping spree in</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="5.97">November now when you hear that you like</text>

  <text start="399.57" dur="8.24">funds to spend so they had to go and use</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="7.019">credit cards they had to go into debt to</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="5.44">make the holiday season happen that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.539" dur="5.461">what that really means remember the</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="6.599">central banks they love debt every time</text>

  <text start="462.36" dur="5.209">we know this entire recovery is</text>
  <text start="464.129" dur="6.66">completely fake and here are some of the</text>
  <text start="467.569" dur="6.13">headlines that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing during</text>

  <text start="486.93" dur="8.28">fastest pace in two years obviously all</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="6.09">these sound fantastic taken together</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="5.069">they paint a picture of a global economy</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s finally returning to a you know</text>
  <text start="500.279" dur="7.04">some type of solid growth steady</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="6.449">positive but when you look at this and</text>
  <text start="507.319" dur="6.1">you look at the reason for the</text>
  <text start="509.309" dur="6.991">improvement it&amp;#39;s not good in 2016 the</text>
  <text start="513.419" dur="7.261">world borrowed a huge amount of money</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="7.649">and spent the proceeds the result that</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="6.389">we&amp;#39;re seeing is growth but not</text>
  <text start="523.949" dur="6.781">sustainable and you can kind of relate</text>

  <text start="543.42" dur="5.31">income coming in cannot support this and</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="4.599">you have this huge amount of debt now in</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="4.02">the beginning it was great you were able</text>
  <text start="551.069" dur="5.64">to have the stuff you&amp;#39;re using it it</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="7.519">feels great later on the bills start</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="7.891">coming in things aren&amp;#39;t going too well</text>
  <text start="560.269" dur="9.731">your income is at a steady level the</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="7.71">interest rate on this debt continually</text>
  <text start="570" dur="5.79">moves up it gets harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="6.92">pay and before you know it you can&amp;#39;t bay</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="5.76">and then you end up going bankrupt</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="4.09">because you just can&amp;#39;t pay for that debt</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="5.85">so in the beginning</text>
  <text start="583.32" dur="7.41">sounds great in the end that&amp;#39;s where it</text>
  <text start="587.4" dur="6.15">gets you and this is part of the central</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="6.96">banking system strategy in the beginning</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="8.19">it feels great it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="8.96">working but behind the scenes it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="8.31">this fake created free money that adds</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="8.5">trillions and trillions worth of debt</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="10.85">onto the existing debt and what happens</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="7.8">in the end it can&amp;#39;t be sustained and</text>
  <text start="620.9" dur="8.31">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="622.95" dur="9.36">we&amp;#39;re at the end point now president</text>
  <text start="629.21" dur="5.65">elect Trump tweeted about General Motors</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="5.34">stating that GM was building its</text>

  <text start="637.65" dur="5.94">importing it to the US tax free and</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="6.22">selling them at us car dealerships now</text>
  <text start="643.59" dur="4.92">GM quickly denied Trump&amp;#39;s tweet they</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="5.57">came back and said that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>

  <text start="651.89" dur="7.21">hatchback for global markets in Mexico</text>

  <text start="662.37" dur="6.12">Lordstown Ohio well the corporate media</text>
  <text start="666.96" dur="3.81">jumped on this and said save</text>
  <text start="668.49" dur="6.03">fact-checking we found that Trump is</text>
  <text start="670.77" dur="7.8">lying GM proves that he has no idea what</text>
  <text start="674.52" dur="7.11">he&amp;#39;s talking about but this audio this</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="7.38">auto enthusiast ewi think his name is</text>

  <text start="712.8" dur="2.93">the dealerships</text>

  <text start="723.07" dur="8.64">dealerships in Lordstown Ohio where they</text>
