  <text start="567.83" dur="4.86">mainstream media can&amp;#39;t the central bank</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.61">can&amp;#39;t the candidates can&amp;#39;t and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="5.46">controlling it all the other reason he</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="5.82">wants to push this to the extreme is he</text>
  <text start="578.15" dur="6.21">needs to build up America using the</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="3.99">central bank system they create currency</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="4.32">out of thin air</text>

  <text start="602.21" dur="6.81">central banks and hit them hard and most</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="5.13">likely will expose everything the</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="4.14">central bank has been doing because the</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="5.34">only way out of all of this</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="7.05">once the deep state is behind bars once</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="4.92">all of that is exposed we can never</text>
  <text start="620.21" dur="3.6">allow this to happen again</text>
  <text start="621.8" dur="4.56">and without removing the central bank</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="4.44">without removing the printing press</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="3.72">which the switch the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="628.25" dur="4.35">intelligence organizations that everyone</text>
  <text start="630.08" dur="4.23">else uses to create currency and to use</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="5.55">it and funnel through different programs</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="5.94">and pocket the funds without getting rid</text>
  <text start="638.15" dur="4.5">of that apparatus and that&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="4.68">central bank the whole thing will just</text>
  <text start="642.65" dur="5.25">start all over again and this is why</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s this entire plan is being done in</text>
  <text start="647.9" dur="4.68">many different phases the last phase is</text>
  <text start="650.15" dur="4.71">going to be the central bank because</text>
  <text start="652.58" dur="3.89">over the many many years the deep state</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="3.9">is deep and wide</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="4.66">first you have to remove the blocks</text>
  <text start="658.76" dur="5.22">first you have to remove the corruption</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="7.38">you have to get through all of that to</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="8.22">get to the source the institution behind</text>
  <text start="668.51" dur="5.19">the curtain the people that are running</text>
