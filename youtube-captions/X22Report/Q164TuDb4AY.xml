  <text start="236.41" dur="4.889">be a cascading effect and all the other</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="5.25">European countries will fall and we</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="6.571">discussed this before this was happening</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="7.71">way before China this is not all Chyna&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="5.19">fault and I&amp;#39;m not taking China side I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="251.44" dur="5.12">not taking the central bankers side</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="6.359">we&amp;#39;re looking at facts here people and</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="5.019">for them to turn around and say hey we</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="3.78">were doing fantastic all this debt is</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="4.051">meaningless and all of a sudden China</text>
  <text start="263.199" dur="4.951">came along and their engine started to a</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="4.17">sputter and this is why everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="6.12">happening though this was happening way</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="8.28">before this and we see at this point the</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="5.519">central banks are trapped I mean we have</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="4.41">so much debt they&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="4.56">rate hike things are falling apart the</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="3.6">market is teetering on a complete</text>
  <text start="284.349" dur="3.871">disaster which is the last indicator</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="3.42">that everyone will acknowledge that</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re in this collapse of course</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="3.39">corporate media the US government the</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="4.68">Fed will finally come out and say yeah</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="4.349">we just collapsed but as long as they</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="2.969">keep the market up there</text>
  <text start="297.249" dur="3.95">very quiet about it if you notice</text>
  <text start="298.839" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re trying to push the story of</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="5.68">recovery and we see right now that QE 4</text>
  <text start="304.839" dur="4.56">is inevitable and I&amp;#39;ve said this many</text>
  <text start="306.879" dur="6.27">many times before when this thing hits</text>
  <text start="309.399" dur="4.89">and the economy starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="313.149" dur="5.22">when they blame this another group or</text>
  <text start="314.289" dur="5.22">country because of it and of course we</text>
  <text start="318.369" dur="3.3">have to remember how this is going to</text>
  <text start="319.509" dur="3.63">come down most likely with an event this</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="3.93">way I&amp;#39;ll make it even easier for them</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.92">say yes see they were falling apart a</text>
  <text start="325.599" dur="7.02">cyberattack it&amp;#39;s definitely their fault</text>
  <text start="328.059" dur="6.84">and thank God the central bank said they</text>
  <text start="332.619" dur="6.3">will help us out of this tough spot they</text>
  <text start="334.899" dur="5.461">will print as much as we need or create</text>
  <text start="338.919" dur="2.67">I mean I know some people out there</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="2.669">saying there is no printing and I</text>
  <text start="341.589" dur="5.22">understand that its creation and they</text>
  <text start="343.029" dur="7.35">push a button and right now the Fed</text>
  <text start="346.809" dur="7.051">right now is looking at raising the</text>
  <text start="350.379" dur="6.63">interest rate but they know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="4.439">do this and if they do do it they know</text>
  <text start="357.009" dur="3.78">the economy is going to completely</text>
  <text start="358.299" dur="4.59">collapse now if they do do it they&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="360.789" dur="4.44">it a little bit to make it seem like you</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="3.84">see we&amp;#39;re in a recovery GDP is out</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="3.54">three-point-seven percent we raise the</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="3.09">interest rates everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="368.769" dur="4.86">then we&amp;#39;ll raise it a little bit more</text>
  <text start="369.819" dur="5.49">and then we&amp;#39;ll have something occur so</text>
  <text start="373.629" dur="3.81">we can see already they&amp;#39;re starting the</text>
  <text start="375.309" dur="4.56">propaganda telling everyone it is China</text>
  <text start="377.439" dur="4.5">and they can switch this off they can</text>
  <text start="379.869" dur="4.41">say China started it and look Russia</text>

  <text start="917.51" dur="6.689">their security so you know exactly what</text>
  <text start="922.01" dur="6.63">their hint hitting we know from the</text>
  <text start="924.199" dur="6.361">Pentagon their reports were completely</text>
  <text start="928.64" dur="4.08">fake phony and falls that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="930.56" dur="4.05">state was actually being hit that they</text>

  <text start="965.52" dur="5.58">they do this every single time the</text>
  <text start="969.66" dur="3.27">reason they&amp;#39;re not hitting those areas</text>
