  <text start="50" dur="4.62">when I to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="51.74" dur="6.15">this is episode 1103 be and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="54.62" dur="5.46">is October 17 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="57.89" dur="4.53">the episode is US government is backed</text>
  <text start="60.08" dur="5.28">into a corner on all fronts only one</text>
  <text start="62.42" dur="5.46">option left to activate let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="65.36" dur="5.34">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="67.88" dur="6.5">geopolitical news now when our founding</text>
  <text start="70.7" dur="8.01">fathers created and designed our</text>
  <text start="74.38" dur="6.76">federalist system they believed that the</text>
  <text start="78.71" dur="5.64">federal government should not have as</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="4.53">much power as the King had that the</text>
  <text start="84.35" dur="3.69">power of the federal government would be</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="4.589">limited to those powers actually</text>
  <text start="88.04" dur="4.14">enumerated in the Constitution and then</text>
  <text start="90.259" dur="6.781">it would exercise those powers only when</text>
  <text start="92.18" dur="8.579">authorized by statute and we can see</text>
  <text start="97.04" dur="7.2">that they believe that the states should</text>
  <text start="100.759" dur="8.061">have the power in the drafting of these</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="7.92">statutes and we see right now that our</text>
  <text start="108.82" dur="7.469">government is not really run that way</text>
  <text start="112.16" dur="8.42">anymore none of these elements of our of</text>
  <text start="116.289" dur="7.481">their original design actually exists</text>
  <text start="120.58" dur="4.72">Supreme Court has allowed the federal</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="5.01">government to control nearly limitless</text>
  <text start="125.3" dur="6.26">activities the executive branch acts as</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="4.95">its own de facto legislative branch</text>
  <text start="131.56" dur="7.149">interpreting statues through executive</text>
  <text start="133.73" dur="7.41">actions and agency rulemaking and it</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="4.321">unilaterally gives itself the powers it</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="4.26">wishes to exercise and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="3.3">many times when Obama that says you know</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="4.08">something i&amp;#39;m going to create an</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="5.19">executive order and that&amp;#39;s that I came</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="5.31">deal with Congress so I&amp;#39;ll just do it on</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="5.64">my own that&amp;#39;s really cold a dictator so</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="5.76">we have two representatives mob bishop</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="6.15">and cathy mcmorris rodgers they</text>
  <text start="160.55" dur="5.1">introduced the re empowerment of the</text>
  <text start="163.31" dur="4.56">state&amp;#39;s amendment now this proposal</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="4.8">would allow two-thirds of the state</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="6.03">legislature to repeal any presidential</text>
  <text start="170.45" dur="6.17">executive order rule regulation other</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="5.759">regulatory action or administrative</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="3.64">ruling issued by a department agency or</text>
  <text start="179.659" dur="3.181">instrument</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="5.039">tality of the United States now the</text>
  <text start="182.84" dur="4.289">amendment is meant to restore the checks</text>
  <text start="185.299" dur="4.02">on the executive branch that exists</text>
  <text start="187.129" dur="4.92">before the massive expansion of the</text>
  <text start="189.319" dur="5.071">administrative state and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.049" dur="5.16">trying to do is enhance the power of</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.429">Congress since it would encourage the</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="5.731">president to work with Congress rather</text>
  <text start="199.819" dur="7.221">than govern by issuing executive orders</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="8.04">now do we really need this type of</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="6.58">amendment know if we follow along with</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="5.28">the Constitution we really don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="5.519">these additional laws these additional</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="6.36">amendments because what we&amp;#39;ve seen right</text>
  <text start="219.139" dur="5.91">now is that the government is not</text>
  <text start="222.62" dur="5.519">following any of the laws so if you</text>
  <text start="225.049" dur="4.321">create new laws or new amendments it</text>
  <text start="228.139" dur="4.981">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going to follow</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="6.6">them most likely they won&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re at the end game here we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="7.62">point in time where the government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="5.7">doing whatever it has to to survive it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="5.1">doing whatever has to take control of</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="5.879">the entire system those individuals that</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="6.03">are in government they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="251.419" dur="6.54">lose their power they love being in</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.4">power and they don&amp;#39;t want to lose it</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="4.801">this is why they&amp;#39;re taking control they</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.229">know the systems coming down they know</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="3.71">we&amp;#39;re at the end game here they know</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="4.051">they can&amp;#39;t go any further with this</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="3.819">they&amp;#39;re going to try to make as much</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="4.38">money as they possibly can right now</text>
  <text start="270.289" dur="4.591">gain as much control as they possibly</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="5.04">can right now and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.58">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing at the same</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="6.24">time they&amp;#39;re trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="280.46" dur="7.26">everyday person that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="7.4">power they don&amp;#39;t have rights just be</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="6.96">quiet and do what we want you to do well</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="5.92">it&amp;#39;s actually the opposite that is true</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="5.19">the people have all the power the</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="6.02">government has none of the power there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="6.96">millions of us and a few of them and</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="7.54">we&amp;#39;re getting to that point where the</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="6.28">people are going to have a choice either</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="4">we take back the country</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="5.33">get rid of the central bank we get rid</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="7.53">of the government and we wipe it clean</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="5.68">we start fresh because we can see right</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="4.05">now even with these two candidates</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="5.34">Clinton and Trump running for office I</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="4.89">know people have heated arguments you</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.97">know with Clinton and Trump and people</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="6.39">want Trump and people say Clinton&amp;#39;s a a</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="5.44">criminal and we can see all the evidence</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="5.04">coming out with all the leaked emails</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="6.63">and we can see right now most</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="5.81">politicians i would say 99.999% of them</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="6.72">once they get into a very high position</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="7.12">their dabbling in criminal activity</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re taking bribes they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="4.26">favors for certain individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="4.23">doing things that they shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="4.44">doing in government because the only</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="4.83">reason they&amp;#39;re in government is to work</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="6.48">for the people and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="9.6">that at this point these individuals</text>
  <text start="370.95" dur="7.71">they&amp;#39;re puppets they take orders from</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="4.92">the central bank from the shadow</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="5.91">government from the elite the globalist</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="6.63">whatever you want to call them they are</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="7.47">instructed in what to do and if they</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="6.5">don&amp;#39;t follow that order they&amp;#39;re removed</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="8.24">they&amp;#39;ve done it before in the past and</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="8.2">they will do it again so at this point</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="5.26">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter which candidate</text>
  <text start="403.29" dur="5.28">gets into office what it really means is</text>
  <text start="405.54" dur="4.68">if Clinton gets into office things will</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="4.86">accelerate and things will happen much</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="7.2">much faster if they actually allow Trump</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="7.62">into office most likely he&amp;#39;ll be removed</text>
  <text start="417.42" dur="7.29">in who knows what way they&amp;#39;ll make it</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="5.88">look like an accident and what we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="3.42">is it will take a long a period of time</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="4.26">for the same thing that was going to</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="4.83">happen with Clinton in office so no</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="6.23">matter what they&amp;#39;re going to get their</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="8.7">way and what they really want is war</text>
  <text start="437.42" dur="6.46">they need to start war to cover up this</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="4.77">economic collapse they need to remove</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="3.19">the rights of the people they need to</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="4.33">Kate take</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="6.24">control of every aspect of everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="6.24">life they need to spy on everyone they</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="6.72">need to reduce the population at this</text>
  <text start="457" dur="6.51">point unless we have someone in there</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="7.89">that&amp;#39;s going to go head to head and get</text>
  <text start="463.51" dur="8.03">Congress to pass legislation to remove</text>
  <text start="467.92" dur="7.68">the central bank it won&amp;#39;t even matter</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="7.15">the players will stay nothing will</text>
  <text start="475.6" dur="10.26">change even though they wanted to change</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="9">it will not we see out in Ukraine things</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="3.81">are heating up there the commander of</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="5.76">the Sparta battalion of the donuts</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="6.93">People&amp;#39;s Republic arson Pavlov also</text>
  <text start="493.45" dur="7.47">known as Motorola he was assassinated by</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="8.58">the Ukrainian Special Forces so we can</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="7.86">see right now out in Ukraine we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="7.89">the edge of war once again we see in the</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="7.08">Middle East around the edge of war many</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="5.22">people say we&amp;#39;re already in more but we</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="4.739">haven&amp;#39;t had the Big Bang yet most people</text>
  <text start="518.29" dur="3.96">won&amp;#39;t recognize war until the big bang</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="5.041">and the corporate media announces that</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="6.24">we are in war but we can see we are</text>
  <text start="525.64" dur="6.24">heading to that time period very very</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="6.63">quickly and the powers that be they are</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="5.46">not going to give up until they get war</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="4.38">yes they might talk peace they might</text>
  <text start="537.34" dur="5.04">talk ceasefire but if you notice every</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="5.34">time they talk about this it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="6.03">when they&amp;#39;re on the losing end they need</text>
  <text start="544.84" dur="6.15">time to recalculate their moves they</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="5.94">need time to bring in more terrorists</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="5.52">into the area they need time to come up</text>
  <text start="554.35" dur="3.6">with a new plan that&amp;#39;s the only time</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="4.89">they talk about cease fire and peace</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="5.16">when they have the upper hand they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="561.4" dur="5.28">want to hear about peace or cease fire</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="5.79">actually they give ultimatums you drop</text>
  <text start="566.68" dur="5.67">your weapons you surrender that&amp;#39;s peace</text>
  <text start="568.9" dur="7.95">and we can see right now that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.35" dur="7.68">happening in Yemen where John Kerry is</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="3.96">out there that he wants an unconditional</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="2.07">ceasefire in MO</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="3.96">slightly what they&amp;#39;re going to say is</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="5.4">the who thiis must lay down their</text>
  <text start="584.77" dur="6.24">weapons they must install the puppet</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="5.22">government back into power and that is</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="4.23">the peace process and if they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="5.04">this the United States is going to bring</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="4.86">in the ground forces and take back Yemen</text>
  <text start="597.76" dur="4.28">because right now we can see Saudi</text>
  <text start="600.1" dur="5.52">Arabia is coming under a lot of fire</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="5.23">because they&amp;#39;re being looked at they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.62" dur="4.159">hitting the infrastructure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="607.27" dur="5.7">killing civilians they&amp;#39;re bombing</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="5.831">markets the bombing funerals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="612.97" dur="5.19">doing all of this right now and right</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="5.25">now Saudi Arabia was denying that it</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="5.16">bombed a funeral said it wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="5.28">us but now they&amp;#39;re admitting yes it was</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="4.65">us and it was a mistake and of course</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="5.22">this is what the United States uses that</text>
  <text start="627.97" dur="7.08">oh it was just all a mistake saying it</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="8.28">was a result of bad intelligence from</text>
  <text start="635.05" dur="6.09">their allies inside of Yemen belonging</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="3.27">to the puppet government so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.14" dur="3.72">blaming this whole thing on the puppet</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="5.1">government but we know this is not a</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="5.85">mistake this was done on purpose and</text>
  <text start="648.01" dur="5.34">what happened was they got caught they</text>
  <text start="650.71" dur="5.22">got cold out on it the world is looking</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="4.47">at them just like the world was looking</text>
  <text start="655.93" dur="3.99">at the United States when they actually</text>
  <text start="657.82" dur="3.84">bombed Syria and this is why they had to</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="3.93">have some type of distraction in new</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="5.04">york and new jersey well the same thing</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="7.35">is happening in Yemen they got caught</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="8.85">and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re back</text>
  <text start="671.2" dur="8.01">peddling because the u.s. is about to go</text>
  <text start="675.55" dur="6.87">into Yemen and they always start off</text>
  <text start="679.21" dur="5.34">first with let&amp;#39;s have a ceasefire let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.42" dur="5.19">have political talks to see if we can</text>
  <text start="684.55" dur="5.159">work this out and while we&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="687.61" dur="3.93">in the background we&amp;#39;re building up the</text>
  <text start="689.709" dur="6.481">troops we&amp;#39;re planning we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="691.54" dur="8.16">ready to go into Yemen now we understand</text>
  <text start="696.19" dur="5.31">that the United States they need to get</text>
  <text start="699.7" dur="3.57">into each and every one of these</text>
  <text start="701.5" dur="4.05">countries in the Middle East if they</text>
  <text start="703.27" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t the petrodollar Falls the</text>
  <text start="705.55" dur="5.88">petrodollar Falls the entire on everyone</text>
  <text start="709" dur="4.83">blames the central bank now we can see</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="3.2">that the United States created these</text>
  <text start="713.83" dur="5.06">falls flat</text>
  <text start="714.63" dur="7.17">to allow them to go into certain</text>
  <text start="718.89" dur="5.67">countries Yemen was the latest one where</text>
  <text start="721.8" dur="4.86">they had the USS Mason out there and</text>
  <text start="724.56" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re saying that a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="726.66" dur="4.47">was fired at the ship but a missed then</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="3.3">was fired again it missed and then there</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="3.51">were reports that it happened the third</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="4.65">time and it missed and because of their</text>
  <text start="734.64" dur="4.35">aegis and their electronic blocking</text>
  <text start="737.01" dur="4.14">signals and everything else they have on</text>
  <text start="738.99" dur="7.2">the ship they were able to counter the</text>
  <text start="741.15" dur="8.16">missile now they use this as an excuse</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="7.29">to fire Tomahawk missiles and to destroy</text>
  <text start="749.31" dur="5.1">radars systems in Yemen and we&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="753.48" dur="2.73">learned that the United States</text>
  <text start="754.41" dur="5.82">government central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="756.21" dur="5.25">preparing a ground invasion inside of</text>
  <text start="760.23" dur="3.36">Yemen because they can say we were</text>
  <text start="761.46" dur="4.17">attacked and we have to go into Yemen</text>
  <text start="763.59" dur="3.66">right now because we were attacked it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="5.34">the only way they can get into Yemen at</text>
  <text start="767.25" dur="6.99">this point and we understand right now</text>
  <text start="770.97" dur="6.36">that John Kerry is calling for peace and</text>
  <text start="774.24" dur="5.28">this is what they usually do in the</text>
  <text start="777.33" dur="3.78">beginning stages to distract everyone</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="4.17">for it&amp;#39;s really happening behind the</text>
  <text start="781.11" dur="8.16">scenes but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="783.69" dur="9.39">that the story is changing about what</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="8.19">happened to the USS Mason the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="793.08" dur="8.46">is no longer sure that Yemen fired</text>
  <text start="797.46" dur="7.56">missiles at the ship they saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.54" dur="5.67">still assessing the situation so what</text>
  <text start="805.02" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s starting to look like to me is that</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="5.13">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="808.65" dur="5.64">bankers got caught that this wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="812.34" dur="3.78">who teased the who teased completely</text>
  <text start="814.29" dur="6.12">denied ever firing a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="816.12" dur="5.76">and it looks like right now that the</text>
  <text start="820.41" dur="3.93">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="821.88" dur="4.86">have been called out on this and now</text>
  <text start="824.34" dur="4.31">they&amp;#39;re assessing the situation because</text>
  <text start="826.74" dur="4.26">they need to come up with a response of</text>
  <text start="828.65" dur="5.89">were they really fired by the who teased</text>
  <text start="831" dur="7.2">or was this another false flag and with</text>
  <text start="834.54" dur="6.3">these incredible you know computer</text>
  <text start="838.2" dur="6.03">system tracking systems on the ships how</text>
  <text start="840.84" dur="7.23">don&amp;#39;t they know you know why because</text>
  <text start="844.23" dur="5.34">this was a false flag this was created</text>
  <text start="848.07" dur="5.33">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="7.23">bankers were able to fire missiles</text>
  <text start="853.4" dur="7.21">destroy radar sites and eventually go</text>
  <text start="856.8" dur="7.59">into Yemen and now once again their plan</text>
  <text start="860.61" dur="7.41">is not working out they&amp;#39;re caught in a</text>
  <text start="864.39" dur="5.73">lie and we can see that the US</text>
  <text start="868.02" dur="4.65">government central bankers they do this</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="6.99">very often and this is why we</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="8.97">continually need to point out the lies</text>
  <text start="877.11" dur="7.59">the deception of what our government is</text>
  <text start="881.64" dur="4.74">doing that&amp;#39;s the real purpose of the</text>
  <text start="884.7" dur="5.64">press this is why you have freedom of</text>
  <text start="886.38" dur="6.81">the press it is to keep the US</text>
  <text start="890.34" dur="5.43">government those individuals running our</text>
  <text start="893.19" dur="6.24">country in check and make them</text>
  <text start="895.77" dur="6.15">accountable for what they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="4.05">is why the founding fathers put that in</text>
  <text start="901.92" dur="4.89">there as number one freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="903.48" dur="5.3">freedom of the press and this is what</text>
  <text start="906.81" dur="5.04">the corporate media was supposed to do</text>
  <text start="908.78" dur="5.77">but now the corporate media is part of</text>
  <text start="911.85" dur="4.26">the government they take their stories</text>
  <text start="914.55" dur="4.53">from the government they believe</text>
  <text start="916.11" dur="5.91">whatever the government feeds them they</text>
  <text start="919.08" dur="4.95">back the government up so with there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="922.02" dur="4.23">no more checks and balances and then you</text>
  <text start="924.03" dur="3.92">have the alternative media where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="926.25" dur="4.86">looking at everything and questioning</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="5.86">every single little thing that the</text>
  <text start="931.11" dur="5.55">government does every little thing that</text>
  <text start="933.81" dur="6.63">these politicians do because this is</text>
  <text start="936.66" dur="5.52">what keeps everything in check and once</text>
  <text start="940.44" dur="4.56">you lose that which they were trying to</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="4.77">do over many many years the government</text>
  <text start="945" dur="5.49">will is allowed to do whatever they want</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="6.63">they can convince you of any lie but as</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="5.91">we can see all of their lies are coming</text>
  <text start="953.58" dur="8.82">to the surface right now we understand</text>
  <text start="956.4" dur="7.62">that there&amp;#39;s a huge battle in Iraq where</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re telling us that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="964.02" dur="5.52">after the Islamic state this is not why</text>
  <text start="966.84" dur="6.3">the US has all these troops inside of</text>
  <text start="969.54" dur="6.3">Iraq I mean it&amp;#39;s close to about twelve</text>
  <text start="973.14" dur="4.53">to fourteen thousand troops in Iraq</text>
  <text start="975.84" dur="3.39">because they only count the permanent</text>
  <text start="977.67" dur="3.6">troops they don&amp;#39;t count the temporary</text>
  <text start="979.23" dur="4.68">troops</text>
  <text start="981.27" dur="4.86">and what they&amp;#39;re doing there is to</text>
  <text start="983.91" dur="4.74">maintain control of Iraq now from the</text>
  <text start="986.13" dur="4.44">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re controlling it</text>
  <text start="988.65" dur="3.84">from those individuals inside the</text>
  <text start="990.57" dur="4.59">country who don&amp;#39;t want the puppet</text>
  <text start="992.49" dur="4.74">government who do not want the US</text>
  <text start="995.16" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re the same things happening in</text>
  <text start="997.23" dur="6.75">each and every one of these countries</text>
  <text start="998.58" dur="7.14">and the US is working in muscle to get</text>
  <text start="1003.98" dur="5.67">the Islamic state out of there they need</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="7.11">those fighters filtered into Syria to</text>
  <text start="1009.65" dur="5.64">maneuver up into Aleppo that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1012.83" dur="3.63">they want them to go because remember</text>
  <text start="1015.29" dur="3.96">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1016.46" dur="5.01">bankers yes they talk cease fire they</text>
  <text start="1019.25" dur="4.95">talk peace but they really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1021.47" dur="5.9">this we see turkey right now they are</text>
  <text start="1024.2" dur="6.57">expanding their safe zone right now</text>
  <text start="1027.37" dur="6.1">Turkish forces now control 90 kilometers</text>
  <text start="1030.77" dur="6.38">that&amp;#39;s 55 miles stretch along the border</text>
  <text start="1033.47" dur="6.33">which extends 12 miles into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1037.15" dur="7.439">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="1039.8" dur="8.28">bring it to 45 kilometers inside of</text>
  <text start="1044.589" dur="9.341">Syria which is what like another nine or</text>
  <text start="1048.08" dur="11.57">ten miles so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1053.93" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re creating this huge security zone</text>
  <text start="1059.65" dur="4.87">and they&amp;#39;re going to put all the</text>
  <text start="1061.82" dur="6.93">refugees there the u.s. is going to use</text>
  <text start="1064.52" dur="8.4">this while the US is in the UN while the</text>
  <text start="1068.75" dur="6.21">u.s. is trying to figure out a plan to</text>
  <text start="1072.92" dur="5.85">stop what Russia and Syria are doing in</text>
  <text start="1074.96" dur="7.53">Aleppo they&amp;#39;re helping create this</text>
  <text start="1078.77" dur="7.47">entire safe zone because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1082.49" dur="7.44">doing behind the scenes is bringing in</text>
  <text start="1086.24" dur="6.42">more terrorist fighters to try to hold</text>
  <text start="1089.93" dur="5.49">Aleppo they&amp;#39;re trying to create the safe</text>
  <text start="1092.66" dur="4.47">zone and eventually what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1095.42" dur="4.38">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to call it</text>
  <text start="1097.13" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re going to say we have a safe zone</text>
  <text start="1099.8" dur="5.88">and this is what we propose because we</text>
  <text start="1102.83" dur="4.65">can see right now the United States</text>
  <text start="1105.68" dur="4.08">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1107.48" dur="5.4">running out of options and the only</text>
  <text start="1109.76" dur="5.49">options they have left is to create the</text>
  <text start="1112.88" dur="4.98">safe zone to create basis</text>
  <text start="1115.25" dur="5.73">within the safe zone make it a launching</text>
  <text start="1117.86" dur="5.1">area for more attacks now the question</text>
  <text start="1120.98" dur="5.25">is how are they going to turn this</text>
  <text start="1122.96" dur="4.68">around so the u.s. fighters can fight</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="4.77">because we can see right now the terrace</text>
  <text start="1127.64" dur="5.73">fires they are no match for Syria or</text>
  <text start="1131" dur="4.14">Russia they are going to be eliminated</text>
  <text start="1133.37" dur="4.95">the United States is going to lose</text>
  <text start="1135.14" dur="4.98">Aleppo and this is why the US government</text>
  <text start="1138.32" dur="5.25">and there&amp;#39;s many agendas associated with</text>
  <text start="1140.12" dur="5.94">this where they&amp;#39;re having the CIA prep</text>
  <text start="1143.57" dur="3.84">and plan for a cyber attack and Russia</text>
  <text start="1146.06" dur="3.11">and of course what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="1147.41" dur="4.14">now we have the elections coming up and</text>
  <text start="1149.17" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re going to use that to maybe</text>
  <text start="1151.55" dur="5.31">postpone the elections they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1154.46" dur="5.24">use this where they&amp;#39;re going to cyber</text>
  <text start="1156.86" dur="7.41">attack Russia to hopefully start a war</text>
  <text start="1159.7" dur="6.91">maybe allow the u.s. to fight against</text>
  <text start="1164.27" dur="4.23">Russia and Syria inside of Syria maybe</text>
  <text start="1166.61" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s well it will start but then of</text>
  <text start="1168.5" dur="7.04">course it&amp;#39;s going to spread but we can</text>
  <text start="1171.5" dur="7.8">see that all of this is being done for</text>
  <text start="1175.54" dur="5.29">one purpose and one purpose only not</text>
  <text start="1179.3" dur="6.09">just for the elections not just to cover</text>
  <text start="1180.83" dur="8.58">up what Hillary is done but to cover up</text>
  <text start="1185.39" dur="8.07">everything because everything is coming</text>
  <text start="1189.41" dur="6.24">to the surface and we can see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1193.46" dur="4.35">is trying to provoke Russia a little</text>
  <text start="1195.65" dur="4.74">little bit more now they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="1197.81" dur="4.62">about placing more sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="1200.39" dur="4.53">does that make any sense at this point</text>
  <text start="1202.43" dur="4.56">in time russia says we&amp;#39;re not even a</text>
  <text start="1204.92" dur="3.77">counter with sanctions or anything like</text>
  <text start="1206.99" dur="7.08">that it makes no sense to do this</text>
  <text start="1208.69" dur="7.72">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work I mean the only</text>
  <text start="1214.07" dur="5.46">reason the US has placed sanctions in</text>
  <text start="1216.41" dur="6.96">Syria is to strangle the government in</text>
  <text start="1219.53" dur="6.09">Syria and that&amp;#39;s why we have the refugee</text>
  <text start="1223.37" dur="3.96">crisis because by strangling the</text>
  <text start="1225.62" dur="4.95">government by strangling the monetary</text>
  <text start="1227.33" dur="5">system by strangling credit all these</text>
  <text start="1230.57" dur="4.5">people can&amp;#39;t get the supplies the food</text>
  <text start="1232.33" dur="4.45">you have war going on and the United</text>
  <text start="1235.07" dur="3.96">States has created this one gigantic</text>
  <text start="1236.78" dur="3.87">refugee crisis so when you hear our</text>
  <text start="1239.03" dur="3.36">government officials out there talking</text>
  <text start="1240.65" dur="3.72">about the refugee problem how we have to</text>
  <text start="1242.39" dur="5.31">take in the refugees they&amp;#39;re the cause</text>
  <text start="1244.37" dur="4.5">of it think about this for a second they</text>
  <text start="1247.7" dur="3.57">have created war</text>
  <text start="1248.87" dur="5.43">all of these countries they&amp;#39;ve created a</text>
  <text start="1251.27" dur="6.69">place where people can&amp;#39;t live they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1254.3" dur="7.38">created an area where there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="1257.96" dur="5.94">constant war going on of course people</text>
  <text start="1261.68" dur="5.49">are going to leave if people can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1263.9" dur="6.06">supplies what reason would you stay</text>
  <text start="1267.17" dur="4.02">there wouldn&amp;#39;t be one so we can see</text>
  <text start="1269.96" dur="4.17">right now the United States government</text>
  <text start="1271.19" dur="8.94">central bankers they are backed into a</text>
  <text start="1274.13" dur="8.67">corner the situation that they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1280.13" dur="4.799">US government it looks like they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1282.8" dur="5.31">no-win situation and when a government</text>
  <text start="1284.929" dur="5.851">that likes control that wants to reach</text>
  <text start="1288.11" dur="7.38">their goal is in a no-win situation well</text>
  <text start="1290.78" dur="7.19">guess what this is when they do other</text>
  <text start="1295.49" dur="5.04">things this is when they create events</text>
  <text start="1297.97" dur="4.78">this is when they try to convince you</text>
  <text start="1300.53" dur="3.96">that another country is attacking us</text>
  <text start="1302.75" dur="3.54">this is when they can they try to</text>
  <text start="1304.49" dur="4.71">convince you with false flags that all</text>
  <text start="1306.29" dur="6.45">these things are happening and we can</text>
  <text start="1309.2" dur="6.21">see we&amp;#39;re moving into that area where</text>
  <text start="1312.74" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re going to be creating these</text>
  <text start="1315.41" dur="5.58">events where they&amp;#39;re going to be blaming</text>
  <text start="1317.54" dur="7.59">another country and they have to make it</text>
  <text start="1320.99" dur="6.21">look pretty bad now think about this the</text>
  <text start="1325.13" dur="4.44">United States is preparing to cyber</text>
  <text start="1327.2" dur="4.62">attack Russia we don&amp;#39;t know when most</text>
  <text start="1329.57" dur="4.83">likely it&amp;#39;s going to be right before the</text>
  <text start="1331.82" dur="3.989">election I think that would be the time</text>
  <text start="1334.4" dur="3.33">they would do it because they would want</text>
  <text start="1335.809" dur="4.891">a response from Russian of Russia</text>
  <text start="1337.73" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t respond at all they will respond</text>
  <text start="1340.7" dur="4.95">for Russia now most likely they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1343.61" dur="4.26">to hit a small town because normally</text>
  <text start="1345.65" dur="3.84">with a false flag they don&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="1347.87" dur="3.54">something really that big especially</text>
  <text start="1349.49" dur="5.31">with a cyber attack they can hit a small</text>
  <text start="1351.41" dur="5.28">town and say that town the lights went</text>
  <text start="1354.8" dur="3.6">out maybe they&amp;#39;ll do a couple little</text>
  <text start="1356.69" dur="6.36">towns where it doesn&amp;#39;t affect that many</text>
  <text start="1358.4" dur="8.61">people Russia just did this they hit</text>
  <text start="1363.05" dur="5.879">those towns so the United States is</text>
  <text start="1367.01" dur="4.89">going to come back and say since they</text>
  <text start="1368.929" dur="6.211">did this we have a bigger cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1371.9" dur="5.79">and we&amp;#39;re going to hit russia united</text>
  <text start="1375.14" dur="5.039">states will actually hit russia this</text>
  <text start="1377.69" dur="3.74">time rush is going to say enough is</text>
  <text start="1380.179" dur="4.521">enough</text>
  <text start="1381.43" dur="5.64">and most likely maybe this time Russia</text>
  <text start="1384.7" dur="4.77">will cyber attack the United States now</text>
  <text start="1387.07" dur="6.17">when they do this it&amp;#39;s not going to be a</text>
  <text start="1389.47" dur="7.02">small little town or maybe it&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="1393.24" dur="5.92">Russia tried to hit a small town but</text>
  <text start="1396.49" dur="4.83">they couldn&amp;#39;t knock it out but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1399.16" dur="4.92">blame it on Russia something like that</text>
