  <text start="53.61" dur="5.13">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="5.55">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.74" dur="6.81">this is episode 1398 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="62.58" dur="5.31">is October 11th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="65.55" dur="4.47">the episode is it&amp;#39;s coming and the Fed</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t do anything about it</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="4.74">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="5.04">financial news now we talked about job</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="5.52">openings before and the u.s. job</text>
  <text start="77.19" dur="5.7">openings that information came out today</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="5.39">and after two consecutive months of</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="5.79">record high job openings all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="5.83">job openings started to head the other</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="5.01">way and the total number of job openings</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="4.35">falling in August from about six point</text>
  <text start="93.69" dur="4.679">one four million to about six point zero</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="4.71">eight million below the six point one</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="5.25">point the six point one to five million</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="5.88">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="7.351">this is that we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern</text>
  <text start="106.44" dur="6.51">once before where the job hires verse a</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="4.77">12-month cumulative change in payrolls</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="9.959">well when it starts heading the opposite</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="10.53">way now if we look back in 2006 going</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="7.261">into 2007 we can see with that we hit</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="6.9">the top of the 12-month job change and</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="5.22">the hires where there are openings and</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="4.65">people are getting hired and then all of</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="4.349">a sudden the openings and the higher</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="7.86">ease that started to fall they started a</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="9.661">decline here we are in 2017 we&amp;#39;ve hit</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="5.3">the peak and now we see the job openings</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="6.18">and the people that are being hired</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="7.93">doing the same exact thing where it is</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="6.06">declining right now which means this is</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="4.77">another indicator letting us know that</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="4.62">we are heading into some type of</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="5.7">recession some type of depression now we</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="4.65">know a lot of the jobs out there there</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="3.859">are completely fake phony and false the</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="5.76">numbers are fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="6.701">what they&amp;#39;ve been showing us is that</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re repeating what happened back in</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="5.58">2007 going into 2008 this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="4.59">been seeing right now now everything</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="4.71">that we&amp;#39;ve seen in 2000</text>
  <text start="187.71" dur="4.8">well it&amp;#39;s exactly pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="5.55">but it&amp;#39;s a lot worse in some respects</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="6.12">because what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="4.35">they didn&amp;#39;t fix anything all these</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="4.41">numbers and everything they&amp;#39;re throwing</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="5.34">at us it&amp;#39;s all been manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.38">us believe that something is a lot</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="5.13">better than it was back in 2008 that</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="5.58">they fixed the crisis problem which they</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="4.5">have not all they did was blow up many</text>
  <text start="213" dur="3.99">bubbles all over the place they</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.14">manipulated all the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="216.99" dur="3.72">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="3.18">everything is great but we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="4.11">to see all these indicators come out and</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="5.16">everything&amp;#39;s starting to turn around now</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="4.59">we know we have this major major pension</text>
  <text start="227.58" dur="3.57">problem here in the US and Europe also</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="4.98">has this pension problem and we know</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.06">that Connecticut has a problem Kentucky</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="5.58">has a problem and many other states they</text>
  <text start="237.21" dur="5.31">all have the same exact problem now</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="6.42">Kentucky&amp;#39;s Teacher Retirement System saw</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="6.08">a 64% surge in teacher retirements year</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="5.58">on year in the month of September and</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="6.22">what is happening there is basically</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="4.739">that the pension crisis it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="3.9">nuclear because a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="5.071">taking the retirement funds right now</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="5.94">now the problem is is that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.22">going to have enough to pay out now the</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.83">Kentucky retirement system reported this</text>
  <text start="267" dur="4.23">week that 677 state and local government</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.08">employees across Kentucky have submitted</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="4.92">notices they were retired this month an</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="6.27">increase of about 23 percent over the</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="7.89">551 retirements that they saw back last</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="6.78">October now the increase is quite</text>
  <text start="284.04" dur="4.98">substantial right now and what is</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="4.65">happening right now is they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="5.61">what to do about this problem and</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="6.149">they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation saying</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="5.7">that some of the people they might have</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="5.191">to take a cut to their payments those</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="4.83">people who are already retired those</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="5.16">existing retirees they might have to</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="6">take a cut and force most current and</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="6.81">future hires into the 401 can 401k style</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="5.91">retirement plans because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="4.56">enough money and again these are all</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="4.16">Ponzi schemes because they expected a</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="4.1">return of about 7 to 8</text>
  <text start="321.23" dur="5.07">percent and they haven&amp;#39;t been getting</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="6.21">that for eight to nine years that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.29">their model is based on and the whole</text>
  <text start="329.45" dur="6.72">thing does not work they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="6.4">underfunded and this is a huge huge</text>
  <text start="336.17" dur="5.04">problem now the Fed has been talking</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="3.57">about inflation for quite a while</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re telling us you know how</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="5.4">inflation is very low they need to push</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="5.1">inflation up and they need to get it</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.02">under control and of course the opposite</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="2.82">is actually happening now they want us</text>
  <text start="351.98" dur="4.22">to believe that there is no inflation</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="6.6">but what they were really afraid of is</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="6.04">inflation now we know a lot of the Fed</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="4.5">houses they&amp;#39;ve been looking at you know</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="3.45">the calculation of inflation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="3.48">coming up about all different numbers</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="4.26">three point one three point zero and</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re saying that inflation is much</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="6">higher than it really is well the Fed</text>
  <text start="372.98" dur="6.39">discovered that it&amp;#39;s official measures</text>
  <text start="375.95" dur="8.4">of inflation CPI and PCE do a horrible</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="6.96">job of predicting future inflation so</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="4.47">what does predict future inflation</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="7.26">accurately you&amp;#39;re never gonna believe</text>
  <text start="388.82" dur="7.98">this food prices food prices predict</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="6.15">future inflation accurately over the</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="5.55">years now we see that past inflation in</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="6.93">food prices has been a better forecast</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="6.66">of future inflation then has the popular</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="4.17">core measure comparing the past years</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="4.29">inflation in food prices to the prices</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="5.28">of other components that comprise the PC</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="6.78">epi we find that the food component</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="7.17">still ranks the best among them all so</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="5.58">the Fed has admitted that it&amp;#39;s official</text>
  <text start="423.29" dur="4.17">inflation measure do not accurately</text>
  <text start="425.66" dur="4.11">predict future inflation the Fed</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.23">admitted that food prices are a much</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="4.38">better predictor of future inflation</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="4.53">affect food prices were a better</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="4.17">predictor of inflation than the feds PCE</text>
  <text start="436.22" dur="4.44">non durable goods transportation</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="5.79">services housing clothing energy and</text>
  <text start="440.66" dur="6.54">more put simply if you want to predict</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="9.01">the inflation well all you need to do is</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="7.87">look at food look at food beverage just</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="4.549">look at what has been going on in the</text>
  <text start="455.07" dur="6.54">real world remember they&amp;#39;ve been off</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="8.491">loading inflation into real estate into</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="7.44">the stock market into college tuition</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="7.539">overseas and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="5.82">inflation is picking up because what</text>
  <text start="473.699" dur="3.841">have we been seeing with food prices</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="5.93">they&amp;#39;ve been continually moving up even</text>
  <text start="477.54" dur="6.57">when fuel prices came down if you notice</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="5.79">food prices didn&amp;#39;t drop the same amount</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="5.7">as they went up when fuel prices went up</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="5.44">because real food and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="3.75">that chemically altered food where they</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="3.509">throw it into a box and they pretend</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="3.66">this is real food and everything is</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="3.811">completely made out of chemicals I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="3.96">talking about natural food and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="6.33">talking about GMOs either I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="501.18" dur="8.01">about natural food continually moves up</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="6.03">a lot quicker than a can of SpaghettiOs</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="5.55">for instance now a lot of people say</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.999">well why does fresh food why does that</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="5.549">price continually move up while the</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="4.83">other food stays very low actually we</text>
  <text start="520.289" dur="4.831">should be asking the opposite why does</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="5.49">the fake food why are they able to keep</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="6.45">that price so low while the real food</text>
  <text start="528.029" dur="7.651">continues to move up in price because</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="9.36">again it&amp;#39;s real they create the fake</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="9.27">food to make everyone believe that the</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="6.45">food prices are stable and most of its</text>
  <text start="544.95" dur="4.02">chemical it&amp;#39;s not real food if we got</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="4.68">rid of all that food and we went with</text>
  <text start="548.97" dur="5.27">just real food we would have a problem</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="4.05">in this country and around the world</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="3.49">because what they&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;ve been substituting all this food</text>
  <text start="557.73" dur="7.17">so we have been seen inflation in real</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="4.65">food prices and actually the cost of</text>
  <text start="564.9" dur="5.04">milk and other products they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="6.119">up once again and they moved up they</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="6.33">move down but overall they continually</text>
  <text start="573.029" dur="5.43">move up and the problem is the Fed is</text>
  <text start="576.27" dur="4.319">very worried about this they know they</text>
  <text start="578.459" dur="6.831">can&amp;#39;t do anything about inflation they</text>
  <text start="580.589" dur="6.451">can&amp;#39;t stop it and as more countries</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="6.4">start to use</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="8.31">other currencies and they don&amp;#39;t use the</text>
  <text start="591.69" dur="6.959">dollar and they start to sell Treasuries</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="5.609">we&amp;#39;re going to see more dollars in</text>
  <text start="598.649" dur="6.541">circulation here in the country which</text>
  <text start="600.959" dur="6.481">means that we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="4.709">which means the dollar loses its value</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="4.98">which we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and the products</text>
  <text start="609.899" dur="5.101">it takes more dollars to buy that same</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="5.099">product and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="615" dur="4.23">see as we move forward and eventually</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that this is</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="5.909">going to break out and the Fed can do</text>
  <text start="621.959" dur="4.62">absolutely nothing about this what</text>
  <text start="625.139" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="626.579" dur="2.94">gonna try to create more currency which</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="3.419">which is going to make the situation</text>
  <text start="629.519" dur="4.26">even worse and there&amp;#39;s going to be more</text>
  <text start="631.769" dur="3.661">countries that are continually dumping</text>
  <text start="633.779" dur="3.601">the dollar and using their own</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="3.75">currencies and those are gonna float</text>
  <text start="637.38" dur="3.06">back to the United States and more of</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="2.73">this currency is gonna be floating back</text>
  <text start="640.44" dur="3.899">to the United States and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="5.7">even more inflation and before you know</text>
  <text start="644.339" dur="7.44">it the whole thing gets completely out</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="6.51">of hand and before you know it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.779" dur="3.631">seeing major inflation now it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="3.3">start off very slowly</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="4.95">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this creep up over</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="5.279">time we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="660.36" dur="4.44">where they&amp;#39;re already saying that</text>
  <text start="662.699" dur="3.421">inflation is much higher I mean if</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="3.089">they&amp;#39;re doing their calculations if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="3.8">looking at food we could see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.889" dur="4.5">continually moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="669.92" dur="4.51">once we get to that point where people</text>
  <text start="672.389" dur="3.781">really take notice this is when people</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="2.73">are going to get very very nervous this</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="2.64">is when they&amp;#39;re gonna run to the market</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="3.419">this is when people are going to be</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="3.3">standing outside trying to get that loaf</text>
  <text start="680.579" dur="3.091">of bread the meat and whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="4.159">trying to get because we saw meat prices</text>
  <text start="683.67" dur="4.909">they&amp;#39;ve just skyrocketed over time</text>
  <text start="686.269" dur="5.17">actually if you go out to dinner at</text>
  <text start="688.579" dur="4.781">restaurants their fruit prices have gone</text>
