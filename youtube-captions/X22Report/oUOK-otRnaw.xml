  <text start="138.17" dur="4.44">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to save it and this is not</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="5.279">because of Trump this was happening way</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="4.29">before this before Trump even became</text>
  <text start="145.459" dur="3.331">president because we reported on this</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="4.38">and how each one of the exchanges closed</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="5.22">how premiums were rising and how Obama</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="5.28">was faking the numbers and using other</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="5.49">funds to keep the whole system afloat</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="5.01">now since all this is not happening you</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="4.019">can see what is really happening with</text>
  <text start="161.57" dur="4.169">Obamacare where it is completely and and</text>
  <text start="163.519" dur="4.291">just utterly falling apart right in</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="3.541">front of our faces and it&amp;#39;s excelling</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="3.929">right now accelerating right now and</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to save it any way they</text>
  <text start="171.739" dur="3.78">possibly can</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="5.849">now last report we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="5.041">truth is coming out and we are seeing a</text>
  <text start="178.549" dur="3.271">lot more of this and a lot more</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="3.69">information is going to be coming out</text>
  <text start="181.82" dur="4.319">but the Cabal they might do something to</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="2.52">completely cover all this up so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.139" dur="2.671">gonna have to watch</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="3.99">very very carefully we see the Senate</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="5.25">Judiciary Committee they have launched a</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="6.33">full-scale probe into a Russian nuclear</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="4.83">bribery case and what is that case well</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="4.41">that is the uranium case which we</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="4.05">already discussed and they are looking</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="3.09">into this they want to know what has</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="4.08">happened they know that Obama</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="4.2">administration approved the deal back in</text>
  <text start="207.02" dur="4.5">2010 giving Moscow control of a large</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.77">swath of American uranium and the FBI</text>
  <text start="211.52" dur="4.47">had gathered substantial evidence that</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="5.58">Russian nuclear industry officials were</text>
  <text start="215.99" dur="5.01">engaged in bribery kickbacks extortion</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="3.78">money laundering and we know a lot of it</text>
  <text start="221" dur="4.02">went to the Clinton Foundation and the</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.4">Clintons were paid now there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="225.02" dur="6.29">investigation going on we also see the</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="7.56">Trump dossier Creators the two</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="7.48">cofounders of fusion GBS guess what they</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="6.54">are pleading the fifth right now Thomas</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="6.42">cotton and Peter Fritsch they plead the</text>
  <text start="242.42" dur="5.88">fifth to every question asked of them</text>
  <text start="245.21" dur="5.1">now if this was a real dossier</text>
  <text start="248.3" dur="4.29">and they had all the proof and</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="4.89">everything they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to plead</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="4.619">the fifth they would tell the truth they</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="5.659">would say this is how we got it this is</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="7.621">where it came from it is backed by facts</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="6.791">guess what it is falling apart now the</text>
  <text start="264.83" dur="4.5">CIA and this is very interesting going</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="5.58">all the way back to JFK the</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="7.41">assassination of JFK the CIA is urging</text>
  <text start="273.23" dur="5.76">Trump to delay the release of 3,000</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="4.83">never-before-seen documents on the JFK</text>
  <text start="278.99" dur="5.28">assassination now most of these</text>
  <text start="281.57" dur="4.26">individuals are dead already but we know</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="4.14">that this was a complete cover-up we</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="4.71">know this was a false flag and basically</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="4.02">what they want is they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="4.92">information out there because if people</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="6.18">learn that the intelligent agencies were</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="4.98">behind all of this well the people Argo</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3.9">would would be like wait what a minute</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="3.87">wait a minute these documents are saying</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="3.42">that the CIA was behind this these</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="4.47">documents are saying that the CIA is</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="5.94">behind the Islamic state these documents</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="6.42">say that the CIA is behind what is going</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="5.19">on in Afghanistan going on in Syria</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="4.14">Lebanon because this is what would</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="4.83">happen it would be a domino effect it</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="5.52">wouldn&amp;#39;t just stop with this it would go</text>
  <text start="321.89" dur="5.49">from one to another and information</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="4.74">would come out and people would be</text>
  <text start="327.38" dur="4.46">actually absolutely shocked because</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="6.69">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who are</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="6.19">completely in the dark and they like to</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="3.93">stay that way they don&amp;#39;t want to know</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="5">the truth they want to just stay in the</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="6.12">dark and pretend that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="7.09">we also see that the CIA is having a</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="5.49">problem with their torture report now</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.66">they can&amp;#39;t get their story straight</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="3.93">some are saying that it shredded some</text>
  <text start="353.78" dur="4.68">saying they misplaced it they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="5.719">where it is and once again this is about</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="5.31">taking individuals arresting them</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="3.671">keeping them in a prison where they have</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="3.24">no rights whatsoever because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.15" dur="6.3">outside the United States and they are</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="6.24">tortured and once again they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="371.45" dur="5.1">to cover all this up now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.25" dur="5.85">seeing here is a lot of these truth</text>
  <text start="376.55" dur="7.29">bombs are coming out they&amp;#39;re rising to</text>
  <text start="379.1" dur="6.09">the surface and the Cabal is not going</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="3.8">to allow this happen now if they do</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="6.09">allow this to happen they have lost all</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="4.72">power so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch what</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="3.54">they do because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="4.26">that things are starting to really fall</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="3.18">apart now we know things are falling</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="4.169">apart in the Middle East we understand</text>
  <text start="398" dur="5.22">that the Syrian government the Russian</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="4.711">government have pretty much taken back</text>
  <text start="403.22" dur="6.15">Syria the Cabal has nowhere to go</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="6.06">the Kurd problem well that is also</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="5.58">falling apart and the sanctions with</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="6.9">Russia that might be falling apart also</text>
  <text start="414.95" dur="5.279">the new German government will gradually</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="3.18">begin to lift sanctions slapped on</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="3.81">Russia back in 2014</text>
  <text start="421.64" dur="4.95">since they are harmful first and</text>
  <text start="424.039" dur="4.141">foremost to the economy of Germany this</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="4.56">is coming from the former Minister of</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="4.41">Foreign Affairs saying that yes this is</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="3.329">what&amp;#39;s going to neat this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="3.9">going to happen and when Germany</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="3.75">formalizes its government they will</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="4.049">gradually lift sanctions because</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="5.55">sanctions shoot those who accept and</text>
  <text start="440.539" dur="5.011">support them in the kneecap and we can</text>
  <text start="443.779" dur="5.431">see right now that once they start</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="8.15">lifting these sanctions well it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="9.11">over because they&amp;#39;ll have no way</text>
  <text start="453.7" dur="6.39">to try to control Russia and you know</text>
  <text start="458.32" dur="3.51">other countries then those sanctions</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="3.63">will be lifted and actually many of the</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="5.28">countries they&amp;#39;re bypassing all these</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="5.82">sanctions now out in Qatar Qatar is</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.41">foreign minister it is they have has</text>
  <text start="469.54" dur="5.16">accused Saudi Arabia of trying to</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="5.49">engineer regime change during its four</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="4.08">month blockade and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="4.71">is that the Saudi government officials</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="6.96">are talking about regime change and they</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="6.96">want basically to bring back the dark</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="5.48">ages of tribes and they are putting them</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="5.55">together in order to create pressure on</text>
  <text start="491.22" dur="5.8">connecting tribes in Qatar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.23" dur="4.62">trying to basically remove the</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="3.72">government that is there and if remember</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re dealing with Iran right now they</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="2.79">want to change things up but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="2.16">think this is gonna happen I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.53" dur="3.06">too late already</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="5.4">Saudi Arabia is already making deals</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="5.43">with Russia with their s400 military</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="4.92">missile system they&amp;#39;re also making deals</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="3.72">with their gas system and we can see</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="4.14">that many of the countries in the Middle</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="6.42">East they are doing the same the UN is</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="5.46">saying that 61 thousand people have fled</text>
  <text start="522.16" dur="4.89">the northern city of Kirkuk in the past</text>
  <text start="524.17" dur="5.61">48 hours the UN says that these</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="5.1">individuals well they&amp;#39;re heading north</text>
  <text start="529.78" dur="5.34">and east because again they thought this</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="5.4">was going to be a Kurd area and they</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="5.61">were settling in and now they are</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="6.9">leaving and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="5.46">Prime Minister al Abdi out in Iraq is</text>
  <text start="544.45" dur="4.17">saying listen the Kurdish independence</text>
  <text start="546.19" dur="4.92">referendum it is finished and has become</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="5.36">a thing of the past and to take this a</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="5.64">step further Germany has suspended</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="5.5">training of the Kurdish fighters in</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="5.24">northern Iraq now the United States was</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="5.48">paying the salary to the Kurdish army</text>
  <text start="561.99" dur="6.07">payments have stopped Germany is</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="6.19">suspending training and paying these</text>
  <text start="568.06" dur="6.15">fighters what is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="4.92">writing is on the wall and these</text>
  <text start="574.21" dur="4.65">countries are starting to realize it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.07" dur="6.72">time to get out and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.86" dur="6.78">doing because at this point we can see</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="4.47">that the Middle East is falling apart</text>
  <text start="585.64" dur="2.64">the Cabal has lost</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="2.85">control their they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="3.96">maintain control but pretty much</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="4.11">everything has been lost in this area</text>
  <text start="592.24" dur="4.85">the only thing that they really have</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.27">less is left is North Korea and Iran</text>
  <text start="597.09" dur="5.83">even here in the United States a lot of</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="4.56">truth bombs are starting to come out and</text>
  <text start="602.92" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of these come</text>
  <text start="605.05" dur="4.38">out and a lot of people are gonna start</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="4.56">questioning a lot of things and a lot of</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="4.89">people well we&amp;#39;re gonna see them appear</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="7.17">in front of Congress trying to explain</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="6.84">why they did what they did and as we</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="6.24">move forward this is going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="6.3">now once again they understand they only</text>
  <text start="624.85" dur="5.43">have a certain period of time now they</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="5.58">love to cover this stuff up how do they</text>
  <text start="630.28" dur="4.56">do it they do it with events they cover</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="5.67">everything up with some type of an event</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="6.84">and most likely as like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="638.71" dur="5.52">saying they&amp;#39;re going to try to do</text>
  <text start="641.68" dur="4.59">something they&amp;#39;re going to try to create</text>
  <text start="644.23" dur="3.47">the event of all events because think</text>
  <text start="646.27" dur="3.96">about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="647.7" dur="5.26">everything is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="650.23" dur="5.49">quickly and they&amp;#39;re already giving us</text>
