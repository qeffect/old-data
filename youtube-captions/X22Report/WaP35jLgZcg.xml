  <text start="93.399" dur="4.17">stages where the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.009" dur="2.911">gonna be pushing their agenda along with</text>
  <text start="97.569" dur="4.771">the central bank they&amp;#39;re all one in the</text>
  <text start="98.92" dur="5.27">same we know that Trump and his team</text>
  <text start="102.34" dur="5.759">they&amp;#39;ve been controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="104.19" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;ve been conducting the Fed pointing</text>
  <text start="108.099" dur="3.781">the finger at the Fed and eventually</text>
  <text start="110.14" dur="3.869">they&amp;#39;re gonna be going after the Fed now</text>
  <text start="111.88" dur="4.349">the deep state they noticed the central</text>

  <text start="118.66" dur="5.189">Patriots they will be coming after them</text>
  <text start="120.819" dur="5.22">now what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="123.849" dur="5.701">to make sense and figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="5.841">blame all of this on Trump&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="5.269">policies it&amp;#39;s a little difficult because</text>
  <text start="131.88" dur="5.77">Trump has improved the economy</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.39">statistically just like the central</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="4.68">banks than the deep state have in the</text>
  <text start="139.209" dur="5.161">past and the stock market he&amp;#39;s been able</text>
  <text start="142.33" dur="3.96">to keep that moving up and up and up yes</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="6.509">it Bob&amp;#39;s up and down but pretty much</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="6.059">it&amp;#39;s pretty stable and they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="150.879" dur="4.821">what to do now that we&amp;#39;re trying to use</text>
  <text start="152.349" dur="6.11">tariffs against him now we know that</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="6.38">Trump and G they&amp;#39;re gonna be meeting in</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="7.241">January and once they sort</text>
  <text start="162.08" dur="7.35">this deal that entire tariff narrative</text>
  <text start="165.7" dur="6.28">disappears so we need to start thinking</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="4.13">about this and start to think about what</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.8">the deep state is going to try next</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="4.36">because they are now pushing their</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="3.39">agenda which we&amp;#39;re going to be talking</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.38">about in just a little bit but first I</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="4.89">wanted to talk about what is happening</text>
  <text start="182.3" dur="4.89">in the economy right now the actual</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="3.87">economy behind the scenes behind all the</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="4.32">statistical information behind the stock</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="5.01">market is completely falling apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="4.68">not Trump&amp;#39;s fault it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="5.85">banking economy which was never meant to</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="6.57">last this long the central banks they</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="7.53">created this economy it is blown up it</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="7.8">is basically destroying its self by the</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="7.2">weight of the debt and what they have</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="5.76">done since 1913 so Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="214.52" dur="3.48">keep everything together right now and</text>
  <text start="216.32" dur="5.1">show the deep state in the central</text>
  <text start="218" dur="5.04">bank&amp;#39;s that the economy is doing great</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="4.23">right now even though in the background</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="4.44">which we&amp;#39;ve been monitoring for a very</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="4.14">long time wait before Trump became</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="3.66">president we&amp;#39;ve been noticing that</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="3.99">certain things are starting to</text>
  <text start="231.14" dur="4.08">completely fall apart now since the Fed</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="5.989">has been raising rates we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="6.95">noticing and analyzing that the</text>
  <text start="239.769" dur="6.041">destruction of the economy is</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="6.97">accelerating I mean we we continually</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="5.91">look at homes very very important the</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="4.5">middle class they owned homes because</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="5.1">this is where most of their wealth is</text>
  <text start="253.64" dur="6.15">they take out loans they hope their</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="5.46">houses appreciate as they get closer and</text>
  <text start="259.79" dur="4.41">closer to retirement they go ahead and</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="3.21">they sell their homes and they downsize</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="3.27">to something smaller</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.44">they take the profits they might invest</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="3.93">it someplace else</text>
  <text start="268.93" dur="4.12">but this is very important because if</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.13">the American people don&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="6">their homes are gaining value well</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s a problem people will not go out</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="4.77">and spend people will not think that you</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="5.28">know they have wealth and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="5.34">seeing over a very long period of time</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="4.62">is that the housing market has been</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="5.539">propped up they&amp;#39;ve created these bubbles</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="6.089">and now the bubbles are pop</text>
  <text start="294.699" dur="5.89">we&amp;#39;re seeing them deflate and eventually</text>
  <text start="297.679" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re going to pop we know that new</text>
  <text start="300.589" dur="5.31">homes existing homes they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="303.619" dur="3.931">declining banning home sales that he</text>
  <text start="305.899" dur="5.73">dropped again in November sliding about</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="6.269">0.7% they expected a 1% increase but the</text>
  <text start="311.629" dur="6.12">opposite is happening now when we look</text>
  <text start="313.819" dur="7.981">at this we see that in the last six of</text>
  <text start="317.749" dur="7.98">the eight months we&amp;#39;ve seen a cumulative</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="6.599">loss since March of 55.9%</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="5.72">and this is eight point nine percent</text>
  <text start="328.399" dur="6.27">annualized which we&amp;#39;ve seen this decline</text>
  <text start="331.449" dur="5.83">which means we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="6.17">now we haven&amp;#39;t seen this this big of a</text>
  <text start="337.279" dur="6.51">annual drop since April of 2014 and</text>
  <text start="340.839" dur="5.08">we&amp;#39;ve been watching the housing market</text>
  <text start="343.789" dur="3.9">very very carefully we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="4.71">the retail market very very carefully</text>
  <text start="347.689" dur="6.39">because these are the indicators of what</text>
  <text start="350.629" dur="6.3">people can do now I know there&amp;#39;s reports</text>
  <text start="354.079" dur="5.43">out there from MasterCard and the retail</text>
  <text start="356.929" dur="4.44">Association saying that this holiday</text>
  <text start="359.509" dur="4.38">season was great but you need to</text>
  <text start="361.369" dur="6.42">remember people who are continually</text>
  <text start="363.889" dur="7.26">purchasing using debt it will never get</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="5.85">better for them because these bills they</text>
  <text start="371.149" dur="4.05">will come due and once they come due</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="4.38">many people are gonna have a very</text>
  <text start="375.199" dur="4.2">difficult time paying these off because</text>
  <text start="378.019" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re spending money they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.399" dur="5.79">have and once they miss one or two</text>
  <text start="382.189" dur="4.98">payments the credit cards they just come</text>
  <text start="385.189" dur="4.32">in they swoop in and they raise the</text>
  <text start="387.169" dur="4.68">rates very very high which makes it even</text>
  <text start="389.509" dur="4.14">more difficult for these people to pay</text>
  <text start="391.849" dur="3.6">off the credit cards and then you see</text>
  <text start="393.649" dur="3.3">delinquencies and things like that but</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="5.43">of course the news never talks about</text>
  <text start="396.949" dur="6.06">that part of it and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="400.879" dur="5.49">that most of these people have low</text>
  <text start="403.009" dur="6.39">paying part-time jobs because they lost</text>
  <text start="406.369" dur="5.01">their high-paying jobs we have to</text>
  <text start="409.399" dur="3.99">remember the central banks they were</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="3.38">creating this economy for something</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="3.84">completely different</text>
  <text start="414.759" dur="6.671">Trump right now is trying to reverse</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="7.41">everything and time is ticking down</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="5.88">and you&amp;#39;re going to see Trump move</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="5.611">faster and faster to try to make these</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="4.62">deals try to make sure that the economy</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="5.21">is stable for when we go through this</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="8.04">transition now it&amp;#39;s very interesting on</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="9.63">CNBC there were an interview going on</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="12.03">between a usb expert and the panel on</text>
  <text start="445.09" dur="9.94">CNBC and Sarah Ison said something very</text>
  <text start="452" dur="6">interesting she kind of slipped up and</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="6.06">the panel kind of laughed at her to try</text>
  <text start="458" dur="8.039">to cover it up but she went on to say</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="8.07">that the Fed because of QE one two three</text>
  <text start="466.039" dur="6.621">and the rest the Fed actually propped up</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="5.46">the stock market take a listen</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="7.39">everybody agrees that it propped up the</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="7.97">stock market no no in the sense that it</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="5.58">conveyed that the Fed was very serious</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="4.389">right it was a signalling tool it was a</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="3.69">signalling tool that we&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="3.69">rates low till the economy recover now</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="3.24">we can see when you listen to this</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="4.951">people laugh and they said no and they</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="4.38">said this was a signal and what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="3.93">saying is not true and she just looked</text>
  <text start="496.94" dur="5.219">like wait what&amp;#39;s going on here and we</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="5.16">can see that during this whole entire</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="4.23">time of all this easy money and</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="3.03">everything else where they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="506.389" dur="3.831">currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="4.979">the government is borrowing like crazy</text>
  <text start="510.22" dur="4.78">they were propping up the market the</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="4.861">market is completely manipulated I mean</text>
  <text start="515" dur="6.089">if we look at the last couple of days we</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="6.75">can see how manipulated and how much</text>
  <text start="521.089" dur="5.671">control the Patriots have over the</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="5.24">market and we knew that this was coming</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="5.22">we knew they were going to continually</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="4.84">push the market up now are they going to</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="4.74">bring it up to 30,000 50,000 most likely</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="4.47">not I&amp;#39;m thinking they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="4.43">keep it at an even playing field right</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="5.55">now and they&amp;#39;re gonna worry about</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="5.92">getting the u.s. and the people ready</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="5.279">for this major major transition and as</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="5.07">we move into 2019 regard we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="549.709" dur="5.461">start to see Trump accelerate his</text>
  <text start="552.14" dur="5.669">attacks on the Federal Reserve System</text>
  <text start="555.17" dur="4.439">and we&amp;#39;re already seeing it just like we</text>
  <text start="557.809" dur="4.32">reported yesterday in the Aspen times</text>
  <text start="559.609" dur="5.311">where they&amp;#39;re already writing pieces</text>
  <text start="562.129" dur="4.68">about the Federal Reserve and more and</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="3.12">more people are gonna come online to</text>
  <text start="566.809" dur="2.07">talk about the Federal Reserve I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="3.169">already starting to see it in</text>
  <text start="568.879" dur="4.5">alternative media we&amp;#39;re gonna see this</text>
  <text start="571.209" dur="5.73">start to happen in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="573.379" dur="6.15">on the outliers not the major</text>
  <text start="576.939" dur="6.82">corporation ones like you know MSNBC</text>
  <text start="579.529" dur="5.61">CNBC CNN and all the rest but eventually</text>
  <text start="583.759" dur="2.94">what&amp;#39;s going to happen people are gonna</text>
  <text start="585.139" dur="4.081">start to wake up and that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="586.699" dur="5.07">point of this but we do see and this is</text>
  <text start="589.22" dur="6.719">coming out of CNN that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="591.769" dur="6.48">figure out a way to blame all of this on</text>
  <text start="595.939" dur="6.031">Trump&amp;#39;s economic policies and this is</text>
  <text start="598.249" dur="5.94">the the headline of this article</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="4.919">Trump&amp;#39;s misplaced economic policies</text>
  <text start="604.189" dur="6.15">could sink the US economy next year now</text>
  <text start="606.889" dur="5.85">if you notice the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="610.339" dur="5.09">been out there telling us that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="612.739" dur="5.64">heading towards a recession that</text>
  <text start="615.429" dur="6.16">everything doesn&amp;#39;t look good the housing</text>

  <text start="621.589" dur="5.641">2020 we might see a recession think</text>
  <text start="625.79" dur="3.06">about what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="4.139">because normally they don&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="4.529">normally they go along with what the Fed</text>
  <text start="631.369" dur="4.26">is saying and if you remember back to</text>
  <text start="633.379" dur="3.99">2008 they were talking about how</text>
  <text start="635.629" dur="3.841">everything is contained that there is no</text>
  <text start="637.369" dur="4.53">recession the Fed has everything under</text>
  <text start="639.47" dur="3.839">control and there were those individuals</text>
  <text start="641.899" dur="3.06">and if those people saw the big short</text>
  <text start="643.309" dur="3.09">they were looking into the saying wow</text>
  <text start="644.959" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s problems here let mean these</text>
  <text start="646.399" dur="4.38">subprime securities there&amp;#39;s something</text>

  <text start="780.22" dur="5.4">the other hand is going to be saying</text>
  <text start="781.54" dur="7.19">listen unemployment GDP the deals are</text>
