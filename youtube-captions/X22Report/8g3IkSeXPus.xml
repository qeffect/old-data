  <text start="141.53" dur="8.7">and less people are putting in claims</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="8.59">well when you think about this something</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="7.5">is wrong here someone is lying someone</text>
  <text start="153.859" dur="5.611">is not telling us the truth and I hate</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="4.259">to say this but actually I don&amp;#39;t hate to</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="6.989">say this the government does have a</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="7.171">record of lying to the people and we can</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="5.731">see right now the government is lying</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="4.829">once again they&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="3.9">numbers now of course they don&amp;#39;t call it</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="3.78">lying I mean if they leave something out</text>
  <text start="176.09" dur="3.66">or if they don&amp;#39;t mention something if</text>
  <text start="177.769" dur="2.371">they change their calculation of the</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="3.09">numbers</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="6.12">they don&amp;#39;t consider that a lie they</text>
  <text start="182.84" dur="6.57">consider it oh we made adjustments but</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="6.84">it is a lie because they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="8.1">adjust adjustments to favor their story</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="6.6">to favor their agenda they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="4.05">looking at the real information and</text>
  <text start="199.7" dur="6.21">producing the real information for the</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="7.22">people they&amp;#39;re manipulating it massaging</text>
  <text start="205.91" dur="6.9">it so it goes along with their story and</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="7.69">that&amp;#39;s a form of lying when we look at</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="5.58">the pending home sales we see that yes</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re in that seasonal pattern right now</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="4.319">we&amp;#39;re pending home sales usually fall</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="4.44">off during the winter and they thought</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="4.681">they were going to have an uptick of</text>
  <text start="225.11" dur="3.26">about four percent and what has happened</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="4.89">right now is that pending home sales</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="6.67">moved up about two percent and this is</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="5.7">considerably slower in the same time</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="6.27">last year which is another sign to let</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="6.18">us know that things are declining not</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.94">improving actually us mortgage</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="6.68">applications the activity fell to its</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="6.72">lowest level in nearly five months and</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="6.899">think about this for a second mortgage</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="7.17">activity the applications are declining</text>
  <text start="257.739" dur="7.361">while interest rates are at all-time</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="6.9">lows something we haven&amp;#39;t seen in a very</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="6.09">very long time and with interest rates</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="5.31">this low they can&amp;#39;t get the American</text>
  <text start="271.19" dur="5.46">person could go out and purchase a home</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="5.94">they should tell everyone something they</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.55">should tell you who is then purchasing</text>
  <text start="279.29" dur="5.4">the homes because if mortgage activity</text>
  <text start="282.2" dur="4.8">is declining and people are sitting on</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.77">the sidelines who&amp;#39;s buying the homes</text>
  <text start="287" dur="4.56">when we know who they are investment</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="4.38">companies hedge funds they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="291.56" dur="5.54">tracks and tracks of homes holding on to</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="5.88">them renting them if they can and they</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="4.45">normally hold on to all of these houses</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="4.38">and these are thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="4.32">upon thousands of homes and they do this</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="3.27">to drive the prices up foreign investors</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="4.919">are coming in they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="6.58">thing banks they&amp;#39;re not foreclosure on</text>
  <text start="310.789" dur="6.131">people they&amp;#39;re instructed to</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="5.22">hold on to it let the people live there</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="7.02">because the more houses you put on the</text>
  <text start="319.17" dur="6.53">market the prices will not move up and</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to create a bubble and</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="6.01">this is one way of creating a bubble</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="6.3">hold back all the inventory pretend</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="6.06">there is no houses to be sold and let</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="6.96">the prices move up we&amp;#39;re getting another</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="7.35">confirmation that this economy is in a</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="9">huge amount of trouble core durable</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="7.77">goods for the 21st straight month core</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="4.62">durable goods orders contracted</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="5.04">year-on-year this is the longest in US</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="5.43">history outside of a recession new</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="4.53">orders non-defense X aircraft while that</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="3.78">plunge by one-point-two percent month a</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="4.44">month much worse than the negative point</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="6.95">1 percent expectation and down three</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="8.31">point six percent year-on-year so this</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="6.61">indicator right now is the longest non</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="7.26">recessionary contraction in durable good</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="7.95">orders in US history what does that tell</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="5.46">us it tells us that we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="4.35">each one of these indicators putting the</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.73">pieces of the puzzle together and we are</text>
  <text start="390.45" dur="5.31">definitely in a recession when we look</text>
  <text start="393.66" dur="4.25">at business spending it is plunged by</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="7.35">one-point-two percent month on month</text>
  <text start="397.91" dur="7.33">again we&amp;#39;re in a recession and if we</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="4.32">look at business spending this is the</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="6.69">worst month on month drop since</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="8.52">September of 2008 so we can see right</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="6.69">now that this economy the system that</text>
  <text start="415.95" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re in it is rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="6.02">very very quickly and we can see why the</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="5.82">US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="424.64" dur="5.56">accelerating their plans for events</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="4.47">accelerating their plans to cover up</text>
  <text start="430.2" dur="5.22">this economic collapse accelerating</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="6.84">their plans to bring the economy down in</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="5.16">a controlled demolition because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="4.32">looking at the same thing we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.16">at and they&amp;#39;re realizing okay it is</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="3.75">deteriorating very very quickly and they</text>
  <text start="445.74" dur="2.94">know as we</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="3.21">move throughout this year and we go into</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="3.33">this holiday season and the sales are</text>
  <text start="450.36" dur="4.46">not good and more stores close and</text>
  <text start="452.01" dur="5.84">retail contracts people get laid off</text>
  <text start="454.82" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s like the compound effect</text>
  <text start="457.85" dur="5.35">everything&amp;#39;s going to accelerate and get</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="6.18">worse very very quickly no more of this</text>
  <text start="463.2" dur="5.43">slow burn no more of this keeping</text>
  <text start="466.14" dur="4.82">everything steady it looks like we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="468.63" dur="4.56">the point where things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="4.03">compounding and we&amp;#39;re going to be moving</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="5.06">forward very quickly with this collapse</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="6.48">and we are getting signals that</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="6.01">something is about to happen now we look</text>
  <text start="481.47" dur="5.4">at the bond market we look at the stock</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="5.28">market and the bonds well they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="5.52">smart money it means that the bond</text>
  <text start="489.54" dur="5.13">markets a much larger a much more liquid</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="4.56">than the stock market now because of</text>
  <text start="494.67" dur="6.87">this bond markets are the first to</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="7.92">adjust to new realities now bonds bottom</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="7.47">in 2015 of November stocks bottomed in</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="7.92">February of 2016 well right now bonds</text>
  <text start="509.01" dur="6.78">are selling off hard this tells us</text>
  <text start="512.79" dur="6.09">something that stocks are on borrowed</text>
  <text start="515.79" dur="7.17">time smart investors are already</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="7.88">preparing for what is coming bonds are</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="9.57">signaling a real problem is underway</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="8.44">another crisis is brewing and this is a</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="5.67">signal that things are starting to</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="5.1">accelerate just like we talked about and</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="3.96">this is why everyone needs to get</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="3.42">prepared and ready I know people are</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="3.69">putting it off saying well you know</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="4.8">something we we had a great recession in</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="4.8">2008 and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about a</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="3.57">collapse for a very long time and it</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="2.91">just doesn&amp;#39;t happen and you know</text>
  <text start="552.09" dur="3.06">something I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="5.16">happen well think about this for a</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="6.18">second going back to 2005 when the</text>
  <text start="558.72" dur="3.93">federal reserve was pumping up the real</text>
  <text start="561.33" dur="4.77">estate market at that point in time</text>
  <text start="562.65" dur="6.63">pumping up the entire economy blowing up</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="9.48">bubbles everyone thought the economy was</text>
  <text start="569.28" dur="8.16">great 2005-2006 2007 they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.58" dur="4.38">believe that you know this would ever</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="3.36">come down how could it everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.96" dur="3.39">fantastic</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="4.38">of course if you look at under the hood</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="3.989">you would have seen everything falling</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="4.38">apart now at that point in time they</text>
  <text start="587.339" dur="4.471">really didn&amp;#39;t have the ability to keep</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="6.18">it continually going they want printing</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="5.16">currency like they are today and what</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve learned from that point in time</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="4.679">when everything came crashing down in a</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="7.62">split second they&amp;#39;ve learned how to keep</text>
  <text start="601.649" dur="8.701">the economy on life support but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="7.14">happening right now there was a limited</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="6.03">time and the limited limited time is</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="4.349">coming to an end and they knew it was</text>
  <text start="616.38" dur="3.66">only limited time but they knew they</text>
  <text start="618.029" dur="5.49">were going to be able to do this for a</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="6.39">certain period of time and again it</text>
  <text start="623.519" dur="6.361">takes a very long time to pump up</text>
  <text start="626.43" dur="6.39">bubbles takes a very long time to create</text>
  <text start="629.88" dur="5.67">the illusion that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="632.82" dur="6.09">well and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="4.71">and while they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="4.25">that the economy is doing much much</text>
  <text start="640.26" dur="5.16">better we see that the underlying</text>
  <text start="643.16" dur="4.299">economic indicators are showing us</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="4.14">completely the opposite and actually</text>
  <text start="647.459" dur="3.391">with the government every time or the</text>
  <text start="649.56" dur="3.839">central bank every time they come out</text>
  <text start="650.85" dur="4.95">and tell the stuff it really is always</text>
  <text start="653.399" dur="5.43">the opposite they&amp;#39;re incredible at line</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="6.84">and we can see right now with Deutsche</text>
  <text start="658.829" dur="5.941">Bank well people are not sitting around</text>
  <text start="662.64" dur="5.43">waiting for Deutsche Bank to collapse</text>
  <text start="664.77" dur="4.83">people are in the bank and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.07" dur="4.32">saying you know something maybe it is</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="4.799">time to get out now the faster the</text>
  <text start="672.39" dur="5.15">people pull their deposits the quicker</text>
  <text start="674.399" dur="6.151">deutsche bank&amp;#39;s liquidity hits zero</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="5.859">which means the faster deutsche bank is</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="6.21">going to collapse now deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="683.399" dur="5.071">deposits plunge by a whopping 13 percent</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="5.069">from the second quarter to the third</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="7.35">quarter sliding from 156 billion euros</text>
  <text start="691.829" dur="6.361">to 135 billion euros and this is as of</text>
  <text start="695.82" dur="5.22">September 30th now this was the biggest</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="5.97">drop recorded since the bank reorganized</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="5.19">its various divisions it was also the</text>
  <text start="704.16" dur="4.02">lowest amount of demand deposits on</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="4.919">deutsche bank&amp;#39;s books going back to the</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="5.17">fourth quarter of 2014 and maybe even</text>
  <text start="711.149" dur="4.541">further and what</text>
  <text start="713.35" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that people</text>
  <text start="715.69" dur="6.54">are protecting themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="719.08" dur="5.61">removing their funds from these banks</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="5.52">that are insolvent I mean we saw it</text>
  <text start="724.69" dur="5.79">happen in Greece we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen</text>
  <text start="727.75" dur="5.28">in Italy and we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen in</text>
  <text start="730.48" dur="6.36">Germany and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="733.03" dur="6.6">happen is if you don&amp;#39;t get your currency</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="5.76">out of the bank it&amp;#39;s my personal opinion</text>
  <text start="739.63" dur="7.86">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="6.6">to use the beylin documents and what</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve been doing is I try to keep only</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="5.49">what I have in the banks to pay the</text>
  <text start="751.06" dur="7.29">bills everything else I take out or I</text>
  <text start="754.69" dur="8.01">put into gold and silver and I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="8.1">difficult for many to do this but when</text>
  <text start="762.7" dur="6.27">this system starts to collapse they</text>
  <text start="766.45" dur="4.68">didn&amp;#39;t create the bail-in documents just</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="4.17">to create them and have them and to</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="4.98">store them in a file cabinet and let</text>
  <text start="773.14" dur="7.86">them just sit there they created them</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="7.8">because they knew that eventually what</text>
  <text start="781" dur="5.55">they were doing keeping this economy on</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="3.96">life support was eventually going to end</text>
  <text start="786.55" dur="3.96">and they were going to have to bring it</text>
  <text start="787.87" dur="4.38">down and of course blame it on another</text>
  <text start="790.51" dur="5.19">group or country of why the whole</text>
  <text start="792.25" dur="6.21">economy just fell apart and every time</text>
  <text start="795.7" dur="5.19">the economy starts to slow or fall apart</text>
  <text start="798.46" dur="4.26">where they don&amp;#39;t expect this to happen</text>
  <text start="800.89" dur="3.63">you can see they already start pointing</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="4.38">fingers oh it&amp;#39;s China oh it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="4.5">emerging markets oh it&amp;#39;s Russia oh then</text>

  <text start="809.02" dur="4.17">continually do this every time in the</text>
  <text start="810.58" dur="5.87">market drops or something happens they</text>
  <text start="813.19" dur="7.29">point their fingers in another place but</text>
  <text start="816.45" dur="6.07">going back to the balance they created</text>
  <text start="820.48" dur="6">this because they can&amp;#39;t do bailouts</text>
  <text start="822.52" dur="7.38">anymore the government said not again</text>
  <text start="826.48" dur="7.11">and they knew this and it took them from</text>
