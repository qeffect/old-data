  <text start="58.629" dur="6.24">episode 1319 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="61.75" dur="5.25">29th 2017 and the title the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.869" dur="5.281">central banks are now colluding with</text>
  <text start="67" dur="5.25">each other to trigger the collapse let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.15" dur="5.25">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.25" dur="5.19">news now we understand that the real</text>
  <text start="75.4" dur="4.14">estate market well it&amp;#39;s imploding on</text>
  <text start="77.44" dur="3.99">itself we&amp;#39;re seeing the retail</text>
  <text start="79.54" dur="4.05">apocalypse this is what everyone is</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="4.469">calling it and we know that credit Swiss</text>
  <text start="83.59" dur="5.25">came out and they suggested that nearly</text>
  <text start="85.899" dur="4.951">9,000 retail locations could permanent</text>
  <text start="88.84" dur="3.3">closed and we see figures that are much</text>
  <text start="90.85" dur="2.49">higher than this and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="3.119">going to be a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="5.61">bankruptcies and everything is</text>
  <text start="95.259" dur="6.03">interconnected because when these retail</text>
  <text start="98.95" dur="4.71">outlets start to close we have all this</text>
  <text start="101.289" dur="5.22">real estate another problem is that</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="6.18">there are these private label credit</text>
  <text start="106.509" dur="5.28">card issuers that are connected to these</text>
  <text start="109.84" dur="4.529">stores now if these stores start to shut</text>
  <text start="111.789" dur="5.791">down well they&amp;#39;re going to be in trouble</text>
  <text start="114.369" dur="5.521">now Moody&amp;#39;s is pointing out that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="5.039">going to be a problem with the private</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="4.38">label credit card issuers with just five</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="3.45">companies accounting for nearly 80</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="4.95">percent of the credit balances</text>
  <text start="126.069" dur="4.741">outstanding and as retailers close</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="3.93">stores an effort to improve the</text>
  <text start="130.81" dur="5.58">profitability trying to stay alive here</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="6.24">well what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the trend</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="4.2">will put upward pressure on private</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="3">label charge-offs</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="3.75">and some of the companies that are going</text>
  <text start="142.39" dur="4.44">to be hit very very hard our synchrony</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="6.66">Alliance data because they rely almost</text>
  <text start="146.83" dur="6.57">entirely on private level private label</text>
  <text start="151" dur="5.7">credit cards and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="4.86">that both Alliance data and synchrony</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re already starting to show signs</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="5.55">of stress so when this continues on</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="3.06">throughout this year and more and more</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="4.11">stores are shutting down</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="5.94">maura going bankrupt we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="5.73">a major problem on our hands and as we</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="4.56">can see with the retail market with the</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="4.44">real estate market everything is</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="4.68">interconnected and once the dominoes</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.32">start to fall well it&amp;#39;s just like a</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="2.88">cascading effect and you won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="3.45">to stop it</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="3.63">now we see the be EA they released their</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="2.94">third</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="3.33">estimate of the GDP was from point seven</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="3.659">percent of the first quarter</text>
  <text start="190" dur="4.5">then they revised it to one point two</text>
  <text start="192.459" dur="3.961">percent now they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re going to bring this up to one</text>
  <text start="196.42" dur="4.23">point four percent and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="6">because consumer spending this is what</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="8.13">brought it up and in the past it was all</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="6.12">based on health care Obama care but that</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="4.86">wasn&amp;#39;t where people were spending their</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="5.88">money this time this time people were</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="5.52">spending their funds on recreational</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="5.279">vehicles and actually they bought a lot</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="3.99">of recreational vehicles last year now</text>
  <text start="221.709" dur="4.11">these recreational vehicles these are</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="6.21">like RVs so are people selling their</text>
  <text start="225.819" dur="7.441">houses and getting into RVs so they can</text>
  <text start="229.36" dur="6.689">be mobile and prepared from when this</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.8">economy comes on or is this the older</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="4.081">generation selling off their home saying</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="4.59">we don&amp;#39;t need this type of house anymore</text>
  <text start="240.13" dur="6.329">we can live in an RV it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="6.45">and we can move from place to place but</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="5.28">we can see this is the trend but again</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="5.55">they revise these numbers they push</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="6.331">certain data in different directions to</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="5.49">boost the GDP numbers and we could see</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;ve pushed it up to about 1.4</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="5.339">percent and again what does this really</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="4.2">mean not much because it is a</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="4.261">manipulated number but when we look at</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="4.05">the hard data all over the place we can</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="3.42">see that it really doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="4.95">sense because when we look in the past</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="5.28">we can see all these GDP numbers well it</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="4.98">was all based on health care than it was</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="6.12">based on soybeans it&amp;#39;s all these one-off</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="6.06">things and it&amp;#39;s nothing substantial</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="5.49">where the GDP number is consistent over</text>
  <text start="287.38" dur="5.88">time I mean bringing it up to one point</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="4.29">four one point seven point nine I mean</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="3.57">it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="6.23">us that this is the new normal right now</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="6.589">and if it is we&amp;#39;re in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="5.469">now the Federal Reserve denounced that</text>
  <text start="303.419" dur="6.671">all the banks they pass their stress</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="8.091">test for 2017 34 banks well they&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="6.569">to go and it looks like they&amp;#39;re fine so</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="5.409">what these banks are doing right now</text>
  <text start="316.659" dur="4.021">they are going to buy back their own</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="2.91">stocks three of the big</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="5.67">Wall Street banks announced they were</text>
  <text start="322.449" dur="8.161">earmarking about 47 billion to buy back</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="6.21">their own shares of stock now JPMorgan</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="3.27">Chase they led the pack where they were</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="3.96">going to spend around nineteen point</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="4.5">four billion over the next 12 months to</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="4.769">buy their stocks back then there was</text>
  <text start="338.38" dur="4.47">Citigroup they were projected to buy</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="4.081">back around fifteen point six billion</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="4.86">Bank of America around twelve billion</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="4.71">now the mega banks on Wall Street are</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="6.66">engaging in these buyback binges despite</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="7.17">a growing chorus of critics who say the</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.329">practice actually harms the overall</text>
  <text start="357.25" dur="5.94">economy now back in September of 2014</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="5.821">the Harvard Business Review William</text>

  <text start="460.48" dur="4.5">what does this mean</text>
  <text start="461.47" dur="6.6">well they have the ability to manipulate</text>

  <text start="468.07" dur="5.28">doing and buying back their own stocks</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="6.6">this is not going to help the economy</text>
  <text start="473.35" dur="6.36">whatsoever but we know this the banks</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.41">are not here to help the economy the</text>

  <text start="505.27" dur="5.85">now Treasury secretary venusian is</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="4.29">saying that yes we need to raise the</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="4.5">debt limit actually we should abolish</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="5.43">the debt limit and just let us borrow as</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="5.19">much as we possibly can and of course</text>

  <text start="526.3" dur="5.48">whatsoever said it can just continually</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="7.11">print and print or create currency and</text>
  <text start="531.78" dur="6.19">basically stuff their pockets this is</text>
  <text start="535.54" dur="4.14">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="3.33">been doing it for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="3.09">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter at this point</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="2.85">if there&amp;#39;s a debt ceiling or no debt</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="3.81">ceiling because you know Congress</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re in the pockets of all these</text>
  <text start="546.58" dur="4.26">different entities they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="3.87">raise the debt ceiling no matter what so</text>
  <text start="550.84" dur="3.15">it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="552.19" dur="3.99">approaching a period of time where the</text>
  <text start="553.99" dur="3.99">Treasury is running out of funds because</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="3.33">we know that the debt ceiling is going</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="3.24">to be raised we know they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="4.95">borrow more we know we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>

  <text start="564.46" dur="6.6">fact we can&amp;#39;t get around this now</text>
  <text start="567.58" dur="5.64">yesterday Janet Yellen she made this</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="4.59">statement where we most likely will not</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="4.47">see a financial crisis in our lifetime</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="5.01">now there&amp;#39;s many traders out there</text>
  <text start="577.69" dur="4.68">financial pundits and they&amp;#39;re all going</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="4.68">off on this statement saying this is</text>
  <text start="582.37" dur="4.92">absolutely ridiculous and one FX trader</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="3.01">former FX trader a fund manager Richard</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="2.8">Breslow</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="3.42">he&amp;#39;s worried he&amp;#39;s worried about</text>
  <text start="590.09" dur="3.9">investors level of delusion in the</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="4.92">markets and worried that the central</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="6.66">bankers are so convinced of their own</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="7.2">omnipotence that they&amp;#39;re telling people</text>
  <text start="600.65" dur="4.98">a complete lie and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re doing actually said Bullard is</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="5.85">out there and he is saying that that the</text>
  <text start="608.6" dur="5.52">market reaction to March tightening has</text>
  <text start="611.48" dur="4.65">not been good at all because we would</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="5.09">have expected yields to rise with the</text>
  <text start="616.13" dur="6.33">policy rate and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="6.28">that&amp;#39;s not happening and what is</text>
  <text start="622.46" dur="6.18">happening is it&amp;#39;s falling and this has</text>
  <text start="625.49" dur="6.95">happened every single time the Fed</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="7.98">pushes rates up we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="632.44" dur="7.93">occur now the question is are the</text>
  <text start="636.62" dur="6.03">central banks intentionally crashing the</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="5.79">system are they colluding with each</text>
  <text start="642.65" dur="5.79">other to set off a spark that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="5.1">bring down this economy now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="6.33">about this since 2007 the world has</text>
  <text start="651.26" dur="7.92">packed on a staggering amount of debt so</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="6.42">in 2007 during this debt bubble crisis</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="4.61">there was about a hundred and forty nine</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="6.3">trillion dollars worth of global debt</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="6.37">ten years later it stands at two hundred</text>
  <text start="667.49" dur="5.82">and seventeen trillion put another way</text>
