  <text start="38.21" dur="5.189">seventeenth 2016 and the title the</text>
  <text start="40.55" dur="5.16">episode is US economy is tumbling into</text>
  <text start="43.399" dur="5.011">an economic collapse that will shock the</text>
  <text start="45.71" dur="5.369">world let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.41" dur="4.649">collapse financial news now as we can</text>
  <text start="51.079" dur="4.021">see the high-frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="53.059" dur="5.07">plunge protection team they have pushed</text>
  <text start="55.1" dur="5.34">the markets up once again it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="58.129" dur="5.28">close to the weekend they want a happy</text>
  <text start="60.44" dur="5.85">ending and during this period we noticed</text>
  <text start="63.409" dur="4.591">something very interesting before the</text>
  <text start="66.29" dur="3.78">Fed came out with their announcement and</text>
  <text start="68" dur="6.9">I mentioned this yesterday we saw back</text>
  <text start="70.07" dur="7.86">in March 10th gold was at 1273 and they</text>
  <text start="74.9" dur="6.69">suppress it down on March 11th to 1261</text>
  <text start="77.93" dur="8.939">March 14th down to 12 46 March fifteenth</text>
  <text start="81.59" dur="7.139">to 12 32 and March 16 1231 and then a</text>
  <text start="86.869" dur="3.871">cat that of course the Fed came out with</text>
  <text start="88.729" dur="6.031">their announcement and then all of a</text>
  <text start="90.74" dur="7.47">sudden gold shot up at the end of the</text>
  <text start="94.76" dur="7.94">day on March 16th like forty dollars or</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="8.37">so and today we&amp;#39;re around 1257 1260 and</text>
  <text start="102.7" dur="7.15">we&amp;#39;re moving right back up to where gold</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="5.25">was now we&amp;#39;re going to watch gold very</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="4.53">carefully because I want to see if it</text>
  <text start="111.83" dur="4.53">breaks the 1300 barrier because like I</text>
  <text start="114.38" dur="4.14">said as time goes on they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="5.04">losing control of the precious metal</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="5.88">market and they&amp;#39;ll continually try to</text>
  <text start="121.4" dur="4.98">suppress it but it will get harder and</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="5.969">harder and when you look at this it just</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="5.82">took one day for it to go right back to</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="5.521">where we started now remember back in</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="7.83">December 2015 gold was at ten-fifty now</text>
  <text start="135.89" dur="6.51">here we are at 1257 1265 so gold has</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="5.31">moved up quite a bit and we can see they</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="8.27">are definitely losing control of the</text>
  <text start="145.34" dur="9.06">entire system and as we move forward as</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="4.989">gold continually makes newer highs more</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="3.089">people are going to be getting into the</text>
  <text start="155.659" dur="3.69">gold market which will drive the price</text>
  <text start="157.489" dur="3.121">up and this is when they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="3.031">start losing control and at this time</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="2.95">I&amp;#39;m going to say it&amp;#39;s going to be too</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="2.8">late for everyone because</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.32">going to see the market completely take</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="5.55">off and most people won&amp;#39;t even be able</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="6.21">to find gold or afford gold at this</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.52">point now the Egyptian Ischl jobless</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="5.79">claims numbers they have come out there</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="6">at 42 year lows now we understand</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="7.139">there&amp;#39;s been a huge amount of layoffs</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="7.89">and these numbers make absolutely no</text>
  <text start="187.019" dur="5.011">sense whatsoever because if you look at</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="5.16">the Isom service employment and you look</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="6.239">at the manufacturing employment numbers</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="5.37">they are skyrocketing and then you see</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="4.861">initial jobless claims where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="5.069">all-time lows and every time we turn</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="5.55">around there are more and more companies</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="6">laying off Scripps health is laying off</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="7.95">about a hundred people we see Trinity</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="9.36">tank car 850 State Street 360 McKenna&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="8.93">and corpses layoffs just continually</text>
  <text start="221.099" dur="8.851">keep on coming and we know at this point</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="7.6">there are no jobs out there now there</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="5.849">are part-time jobs yes but if you were</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="4.829">making 50 60 70 80 thousand or more and</text>
  <text start="235.799" dur="4.53">you were living at a certain lifestyle</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="5.671">where you purchased your home your car</text>
  <text start="240.329" dur="6.78">your bills are set up for that lifestyle</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="5.43">it is very difficult at this point to go</text>
  <text start="247.109" dur="5.16">to one two three part-time jobs because</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="6.81">you can never make up the difference now</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="6.12">companies they like to do a little trick</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="5.16">to make everyone think that hey there</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="4.771">are plenty of jobs out there do we just</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t find the right people I know</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="4.229">because I was in a corporation actually</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.05">many corporations that did this what</text>
  <text start="267.389" dur="3.78">they do is they have job openings right</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.23">now the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="6.541">they&amp;#39;re saying that US employers are</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="7.319">advertising more jobs and they just</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="5.1">can&amp;#39;t find the people and the labor</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="4.861">department is saying job openings jump</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="6.9">four point nine percent to 5.5 million</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="7.32">and US employers advertise more open</text>
  <text start="289.71" dur="5.97">positions in January but yet hiring fell</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="4.5">and they keep making it seem like</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s just no one out there</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="7.22">just can&amp;#39;t find the people well what</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="8.28">happens is the companies have open Rex</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="4.9">but there&amp;#39;s a hiring freeze I know</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="4.08">because I worked in many of these</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="4.08">departments where they said go ahead go</text>
  <text start="312.54" dur="3.69">out and interview people we go out and</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="4.26">interview people we pick different</text>
  <text start="316.23" dur="3.27">candidates and they say well hold on to</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="3.9">that person right now we&amp;#39;re in a hiring</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="3.63">freeze and we of course turn around and</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="3.3">say well why don&amp;#39;t we waste our time</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="4.08">doing this if we&amp;#39;re in a hiring freeze</text>
  <text start="325.38" dur="4.1">when is the hiring freeze end we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="5.19">know yet but we want to keep that person</text>
  <text start="329.48" dur="5.44">you know out there we want to make sure</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="3.93">that we can get in touch with them but</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="4.71">right now we can&amp;#39;t fill any of the</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="5.04">positions now each department is not</text>
  <text start="339.63" dur="3.78">going to give up their open wreck here</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="4.14">because if they do they kind of lose it</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="3.42">so what they do is they say yes we need</text>
  <text start="345.51" dur="2.3">another person for this position when</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.62">you know the person for this position</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="7.03">but companies they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="6.09">ability to hire these people just</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="5.7">because you have an open wreck doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="7.67">mean you&amp;#39;re going to hire these people</text>
  <text start="360.54" dur="7.92">and this is false when they report this</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="6.28">because I&amp;#39;ve seen this done many many</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="6.09">times and if you&amp;#39;re in a certain</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="4.59">department there&amp;#39;s no manager or upper</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="3.57">management going to say you know what</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="3.48">forget it then we don&amp;#39;t need this open</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="2.82">right they keep it because they know</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ll never get it back from corporate</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="5.46">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is an</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="6.57">illusion to keep everyone in the dark of</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="8.579">what&amp;#39;s really going on and we can see as</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="7.28">we move forward here people are going to</text>
  <text start="394.979" dur="7.641">continually get laid off retail is</text>
  <text start="397.94" dur="8.38">contracting and people&amp;#39;s incomes are</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="10.18">actually falling and we know from tax</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="8.73">revenue from corporations that there is</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="4.56">nothing coming into the government yes</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="4.59">they implemented FATCA they have taxes</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="3.75">intertwined into Obamacare which made up</text>
  <text start="419.64" dur="3.12">the difference but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter the</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="3.809">government spending a lot more and they</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="4.29">have coming in but as more and more</text>
  <text start="424.919" dur="4.201">people fall off the job market as more</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="4.32">and more people take part-time jobs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="4.62">getting more and more difficult for</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.59">our earnings to go up where revenue</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="6.03">coming into the government people making</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="6.69">more money and since December the Fed</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.59">has gone from pricing in for hikes 22</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="5.01">and you know it&amp;#39;s going to go down to</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="5.3">maybe one and consumers right now</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;re very worried about their jobs</text>
  <text start="449.66" dur="4.6">they&amp;#39;re worried about earnings</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="5.011">expectations they&amp;#39;re declining they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="5.159">down right now consumers are more</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="5.91">worried about their jobs and they were</text>
  <text start="459.419" dur="6.151">in December 53.7 percent believe jobs</text>
  <text start="462.9" dur="4.65">are not plentiful another twenty four</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="3.75">point two percent thing jobs are hard to</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="4.41">get now how can that be when</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="7.319">unemployment is at four point nine</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="6.989">percent because they can&amp;#39;t find the jobs</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="5.221">where they were laid off from they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="478.949" dur="8.161">exist those believe jobs are plentiful</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="7.41">declined 2.1 percent since December the</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="6.27">number of people expecting their income</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="8.07">will drop has risen by 2.1 percent to</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="7.5">12.5 percent seventy percent expect the</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="6.03">same now we know what Obamacare is going</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="3.509">up we know rents are going up and we see</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="5.519">that eighty two-point-eight percent</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="7.191">expect real incomes will decline that</text>
  <text start="508.889" dur="7.7">means people will have less to spend</text>
  <text start="511.58" dur="7.78">because this entire economy right now is</text>
  <text start="516.589" dur="7.211">imploding these are the signs that we</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="6.18">see when the economy is collapsing we</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="2.85">saw it back in two thousand eight people</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="4.32">saw it back in nineteen twenty nine</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="6.48">people saw it back in 2001 it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="6.419">the same now caterpillar they have</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="7.44">slashed their guidance the first quarter</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="7.381">is a complete disaster and caterpillar</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="6.209">they&amp;#39;re in their own great depression at</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="6.72">this point the global sales market for</text>
  <text start="546.779" dur="7.351">them is a disaster now the philly fed it</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="5.85">has spiked to 15 month highs this is the</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="6.15">biggest jump in new order since october</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="6.99">of 2005 and they were expecting negative</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="4.92">1.5 and it jumped from negative two</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="5.79">point eight to twelve</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="5.58">point for positive 12.4 and we saw the</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="5.61">same thing happened with Empire</text>
  <text start="570.78" dur="8.55">manufacturing now this was driven by a</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="7.41">huge spike in new orders but you have to</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="5.94">wonder with Japanese and Chinese trade</text>
  <text start="582.03" dur="6.18">data so dismal and inventories and near</text>
  <text start="585.27" dur="6.51">record levels who&amp;#39;s just placing these</text>
  <text start="588.21" dur="5.82">orders who&amp;#39;s doing this now we know that</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="6.54">the Baltic Dry Index for the last couple</text>
  <text start="594.03" dur="6.48">of weeks has risen and we can see this</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="6.3">probably led into the Empire Fed and the</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="6.9">philly fed increasing and we see the</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="6.12">Baltic Dry Index now the dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.4">is most likely over we saw that the</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="5.22">Baltic Dry Index fell it has fallen</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="5.97">again we&amp;#39;re going down a 392 and it</text>
  <text start="615.96" dur="4.47">seems like we are on a downward trend</text>
  <text start="618.78" dur="3.9">once again we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="4.74">this very carefully to see where it ends</text>
  <text start="622.68" dur="4.59">up and of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="625.17" dur="4.11">US government the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="4.17">all going to come out and say this is</text>
  <text start="629.28" dur="3.51">the new normal this is what you should</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="6.2">expect but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="8.19">is a complete collapse of the entire</text>
  <text start="637.64" dur="5.65">system and it&amp;#39;s continually collapsing</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s not getting better it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="3.63">to get better people might believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="2.82">going to be awesome because they have a</text>
  <text start="646.92" dur="4.44">very hard time thinking that things are</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="5.4">going to get worse and I&amp;#39;m not trying to</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="4.38">do this to scare people looking at facts</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re looking at real economic</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="4.74">indicators we&amp;#39;re putting the pieces</text>
  <text start="657.84" dur="7.32">together and we&amp;#39;re showing that things</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="6.66">are not right something is wrong now the</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="3.93">US government central bankers yeah they</text>
  <text start="667.14" dur="4.34">can come out and show us numbers but</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="6.42">when we look at unemployment we say well</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="6.82">why are all these people not counted why</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="4.35">did you change the calculation why do</text>
  <text start="678.3" dur="3.42">you have high frequency traders and</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="4.02">plunge protection why don&amp;#39;t you let the</text>
  <text start="681.72" dur="5.19">free market decide what the stock market</text>
  <text start="683.88" dur="5.1">should do why did the Fed step in and by</text>
  <text start="686.91" dur="3.69">trillions and trillions of toxic real</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="4.14">estate why did we have the toxic real</text>
  <text start="690.6" dur="5.19">estate in the first place why were they</text>
  <text start="693.12" dur="4.38">packaging and being said as triple-a</text>
