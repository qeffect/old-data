  <text start="204.169" dur="4.65">corner they don&amp;#39;t know what to do and</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="5.739">like I said before every time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="6.721">back into a corner guess what they reap</text>

  <text start="215.54" dur="4.86">and what they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="3.629">completely exposed right now it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="3.47">discussing that a little bit later but</text>
  <text start="222.169" dur="6.03">first let&amp;#39;s head out to the UK because</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="6.97">Jeremy Corbyn right now he wants to</text>
  <text start="228.199" dur="4.85">cancel the referendum now Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="230.84" dur="5.929">is out there and saying absolutely not</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="6.55">we are not doing anything like that</text>
  <text start="236.769" dur="5.231">actually he tweeted out like Trump</text>
  <text start="239.599" dur="4.17">tweets out he said the following Jeremy</text>
  <text start="242" dur="3.75">Corbyn wants to cancel the referendum</text>
  <text start="243.769" dur="4.291">and argue about brexit for years I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.069">committed to leading our country forward</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="6.06">and getting Britain out of the EU by</text>
  <text start="250.819" dur="5.581">October 31st and we know there are</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="4.35">certain individuals within the EU who</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="4.67">have come out and said listen we are not</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="4.919">going to let this happen no matter what</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="5.469">again they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner now</text>
  <text start="263.389" dur="5.52">they don&amp;#39;t have that person that they</text>
  <text start="266.539" dur="5.521">needed before it was Theresa May she</text>
  <text start="268.909" dur="5.401">wasn&amp;#39;t really negotiating a brexit she</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="6.21">was negotiating a deal that would keep</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="8.55">the UK in the EU making everyone believe</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="7.8">they left now we have someone in the UK</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="6.21">who&amp;#39;s actually going to leave and they</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="6.569">can&amp;#39;t control him he doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="6.17">deal with the EU because he knows that</text>
  <text start="292.639" dur="7.671">any deal that he strikes with them</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="8.73">would be not good for the UK the people</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="6.9">would suffer the EU would benefit and</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s no reason to have a deal the</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="4.37">deal is being made with the United</text>
  <text start="309.19" dur="5.849">States with Trump and the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="5.02">that deal is a lot better and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.039" dur="3.391">gonna be many other countries that are</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="4.409">going to be making a deal with the UK</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.47">and these are going to be free trade</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="4.771">deals bilateral free trade deals and</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s going to go outside of the EU and</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="5.009">other countries are going to see this</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="4.71">and they&amp;#39;re going to join into they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.789" dur="3.841">gonna say we want to do what the UK is</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="4.529">doing we want to leave just like there</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="4.469">they have done and we want to make deals</text>
  <text start="336.849" dur="6.481">because look they&amp;#39;re doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="339.099" dur="6.271">and this is going to spread over time</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="5.01">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting we know that</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="7.979">Trump he wants to make a deal with China</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="9.12">now at this point Trump G they are out</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="7.531">there and Trump is using this period of</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="5.31">time to push countries out of China now</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="4.62">yes this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="5.97">remember the globalists the central bank</text>
  <text start="365.5" dur="6.12">the mainstream media the deep state they</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="5.22">push all companies out now every single</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="4.89">one but a lot of the companies out of</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="5.9">the United States into China and many</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="7.83">other countries this was done on purpose</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="6.549">Trump now is reversing all of this now</text>
  <text start="384.34" dur="3.66">remember the globalists the deep state</text>
  <text start="386.409" dur="4.741">the central banks they had men he hears</text>
  <text start="388" dur="5.639">to do this Trump does not so he has to</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="4.68">accelerate the process how do you do</text>
  <text start="393.639" dur="5.34">that do you beg companies to come back</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="5.72">and hopefully they come back no you have</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="6.241">to use leverage you have to use tariffs</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="7.54">you have to look for laws that allows</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="6.66">the companies or force the companies to</text>
  <text start="409.09" dur="5.72">come back to the United States and this</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="6.99">is why Trump mentioned Jimmy Carter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="9.099">1970 law which gives Trump sweeping</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="6.299">powers to block China trade now the law</text>
  <text start="423.909" dur="2.94">we discussed this before is the</text>
  <text start="425.169" dur="3.84">international emergency economic Powers</text>
  <text start="426.849" dur="4.32">Act and this was signed by</text>
  <text start="429.009" dur="5.011">McCarter and it gives the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="5.31">sweeping powers to restrict trade once a</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="6.119">national emergency is declared now the</text>
  <text start="436.479" dur="6.3">OEE PA was preceded by the trading with</text>
  <text start="440.139" dur="5.25">the enemy Act of 1917 which gave the</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="6.51">president broad powers to restrict trade</text>
  <text start="445.389" dur="5.43">in times of war the 1977 law gave the</text>
  <text start="449.289" dur="3.93">executive branch similar powers in</text>
  <text start="450.819" dur="4.141">peacetime the president still has to</text>
  <text start="453.219" dur="4.47">declare an emergency to activate the</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="5.579">authority now the law states that the</text>
  <text start="457.689" dur="5.34">president may nullify void prevent or</text>
  <text start="460.539" dur="5.21">prohibit any acquisition holding</text>
  <text start="463.029" dur="5.01">withholding use transfer withdrawal</text>
  <text start="465.749" dur="4.81">transportation importation or</text>
  <text start="468.039" dur="5.31">exportation of any property in which any</text>
  <text start="470.559" dur="6.301">foreign country or a national thereof</text>
  <text start="473.349" dur="6.18">has any interest in 1981 Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="5.25">decision dames and Moore verse Reagan</text>
  <text start="479.529" dur="5.61">affirmed that the white house had broad</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="5.369">powers under the law now Congress passed</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="4.471">the national emergency act in 1976 in</text>
  <text start="487.479" dur="4.201">the wake of the Watergate crisis to</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="4.829">limit the executive branch&amp;#39;s power to</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="4.859">declare an emergency outside wartime the</text>
  <text start="494.439" dur="5.671">following year Congress amended that law</text>
  <text start="496.539" dur="5.821">by passing the OEE PA to clarify that</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="4.919">peacetime economic sanctions could be</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="4.799">enacted by the president but could also</text>
  <text start="505.029" dur="5.82">be overridden by an act of Congress</text>
  <text start="507.159" dur="7.471">however the Supreme Court ruled in 1983</text>
  <text start="510.849" dur="7.651">that Congress could not override trade</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="7.019">sanctions now Trump mentioned this</text>
  <text start="518.5" dur="8.19">because he wants everyone to understand</text>
  <text start="521.649" dur="8.19">if I had to I would use this to bring</text>
  <text start="526.69" dur="6.3">the corporation&amp;#39;s back to the United</text>
  <text start="529.839" dur="4.411">States now why in the world would he</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="4.74">mention this do I think he&amp;#39;s gonna use</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="5.49">it right now not right now no if he had</text>
  <text start="537.73" dur="2.7">to he knows he has this in his back</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="4.8">pocket</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="6.899">he knows that the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="6.75">collapsing he knows he needs to bring</text>
  <text start="547.329" dur="6.62">these corporations back he knows that he</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="7.71">has a certain period of time to do this</text>
  <text start="553.949" dur="6.711">he doesn&amp;#39;t have 20 years he only has a</text>
  <text start="559" dur="4.66">small window</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="6.27">and right now he&amp;#39;s doing everything he</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="6.719">possibly can to bring companies back and</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="5.519">to create this new economy which is</text>
  <text start="570.379" dur="6.361">running parallel to the central bank</text>
  <text start="572.449" dur="5.49">economy and if it doesn&amp;#39;t work the way</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="3.959">he wants it to work</text>
  <text start="577.939" dur="4.291">he will then go to Jimmy Carter&amp;#39;s 1977</text>
  <text start="580.699" dur="3.351">law and say listen all these companies</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="4.099">you need to come back to United States</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="5.589">and I just shut it all down</text>
  <text start="586.329" dur="7.51">and guess what the companies will have</text>
  <text start="589.639" dur="7.111">to come back and he mentioned this to</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="7.951">let everyone know and to understand what</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="7.829">might happen if he has to do this think</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="8.46">about what he&amp;#39;s doing down he&amp;#39;s creating</text>
  <text start="604.579" dur="8.13">a new system for the people who&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="610.25" dur="3.66">to stop him health we know it&amp;#39;s the deep</text>
  <text start="612.709" dur="4.62">state the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="613.91" dur="4.739">especially the central bank now we know</text>
  <text start="617.329" dur="2.791">the central bankers are out there and</text>
  <text start="618.649" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re saying that Trump&amp;#39;s trade war is</text>
  <text start="620.12" dur="4.079">the single biggest threat to the economy</text>
  <text start="622.009" dur="4.68">know it&amp;#39;s your debt it&amp;#39;s your system</text>
  <text start="624.199" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s the biggest threat to the entire</text>
  <text start="626.689" dur="7.621">world not these trade wars the trade</text>
  <text start="629.689" dur="7.38">wars are a threat to their system not to</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="5.61">the real economic system if it was run</text>
  <text start="637.069" dur="6.421">by the people the threat is to what they</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="5.55">have now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="2.57">the former New York Fed president bill</text>
  <text start="645.47" dur="2.729">Dudley</text>
  <text start="646.06" dur="6.129">called on the Federal Reserve to</text>

  <text start="652.189" dur="6.781">re-election and he made the plea in an</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="5.969">op-ed published by Bloomberg News Dudley</text>
  <text start="658.97" dur="3.96">argued that trumps effort to reset trade</text>
  <text start="661.189" dur="4.471">with China is hurting the economy and</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="6.089">that the Fed should enact policies that</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="7.349">hinder Trump and hurt his reelection</text>
  <text start="669.019" dur="7.201">chances think about what Dudley just</text>
  <text start="673.009" dur="6.901">said he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="7.859">this is the true agenda of the central</text>
