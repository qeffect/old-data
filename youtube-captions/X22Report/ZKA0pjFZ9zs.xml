  <text start="235.13" dur="4.439">trying to bring drops back to America</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="3.72">but we need to understand something very</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="3.721">important and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.42">bringing jobs back to America is a great</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="5.94">thing and what I&amp;#39;m talking about is that</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="4.3">he just can&amp;#39;t bring them back without</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="4.11">going to the root of the problem the</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="4.47">root of the problem is that this country</text>
  <text start="253.34" dur="4.079">is in a huge amount of debt the root of</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="3.989">the problem is that there&amp;#39;s a central</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="3.931">bank that&amp;#39;s still calling the shots the</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="6.331">root of the problem is that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="7.26">lied to for eight years plus about how</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="4.92">this economy is really doing so when we</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="4.65">look at the economy it&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="4.83">seems now of course he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="4.62">everyone on board he&amp;#39;s getting many</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="3.96">different companies he&amp;#39;s getting all the</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="4.14">automaker&amp;#39;s on board bringing</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="4.71">manufacturing back and he wants everyone</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="5.01">bringing jobs back I mean this is great</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="6.03">publicity this is a great move on his</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="5.52">part but he needs to go to the root of</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="4.95">the problem and if we look at the auto</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="5.67">industry we see that there&amp;#39;s well</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="5.699">there&amp;#39;s problems here and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="6.569">looking at is the decline of used car</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="7.711">prices and this could spell disaster for</text>

  <text start="538.21" dur="6.67">when we really look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="540.71" dur="8.25">that there&amp;#39;s no way that the economy can</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="6.42">work the way it is I mean the Democrats</text>

  <text start="569.29" dur="6.58">everyone goes a it&amp;#39;s not a big deal who</text>
  <text start="572.18" dur="5.34">cares it is a big deal just because the</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="3.87">Obama administration and administration</text>
  <text start="577.52" dur="4.47">before that they tell you it&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="5.219">deal it really is</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="6.14">and all of a sudden we have Trump&amp;#39;s pick</text>
  <text start="584.959" dur="6.421">for budget director Nick Mulvaney well</text>
  <text start="588.13" dur="6.67">he just blew the lid off of the problem</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="6.39">with the debt he&amp;#39;s saying that this 20</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="6.03">trillion dollars of national event it is</text>
  <text start="597.77" dur="5.73">the equivalent of an ordinary American</text>

  <text start="628.85" dur="7.53">have to cut certain things so we talked</text>
  <text start="632.779" dur="6.781">about pain before and we are headed</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="6.019">towards that point now they might raise</text>
  <text start="639.56" dur="5.01">the debt ceiling they might not</text>
  <text start="642.399" dur="5.741">according to what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="644.57" dur="8.579">now he has a hiring freeze he&amp;#39;s cutting</text>
  <text start="648.14" dur="8.25">programs he&amp;#39;s reducing spending and if</text>
  <text start="653.149" dur="9.171">he&amp;#39;s going to do the right thing he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="713.63" dur="3.349">what do we do</text>
  <text start="715.059" dur="4.17">well they they would have to cut a lot</text>

  <text start="756.579" dur="8.88">period in any year over the past decade</text>
  <text start="760.859" dur="7.63">now why are they doing this because the</text>
  <text start="765.459" dur="6.54">stock market is in a bubble this is the</text>
  <text start="768.489" dur="6.66">classic bubble definition where the</text>
  <text start="771.999" dur="5.73">market rises up those individuals of</text>
  <text start="775.149" dur="4.62">insiders that know what&amp;#39;s going on while</text>

  <text start="838.749" dur="4.23">there well they&amp;#39;re realizing time is</text>
  <text start="841.389" dur="4.02">short right now we can&amp;#39;t wait for this</text>
  <text start="842.979" dur="4.08">experiment to be finished we need to</text>
  <text start="845.409" dur="3.17">make sure that everyone is dependent on</text>
  <text start="847.059" dur="3.411">us this is what their</text>

  <text start="853.17" dur="5.579">like it when people are dependent on the</text>
  <text start="855.929" dur="5.31">government because it keeps them with</text>
  <text start="858.749" dur="4.14">the government and most of the time</text>
  <text start="861.239" dur="5.85">those people say whatever you want will</text>

  <text start="896.1" dur="10.739">or junker is buying off his enemies he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.939" dur="8.64">buying the people he&amp;#39;s making them</text>
  <text start="906.839" dur="8.4">dependent on them why well the UK is</text>
  <text start="911.579" dur="7.74">getting ready to leave the EU other</text>
  <text start="915.239" dur="6.18">countries want to leave the EU they just</text>
  <text start="919.319" dur="4.291">pushed their agenda forward saying</text>

  <text start="923.61" dur="4.62">unemployed all those people who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.189" dur="4.32">find work because we destroyed the</text>

  <text start="930.509" dur="8.281">money all you have to do is be loyal to</text>
  <text start="933.749" dur="8.46">us this is their next move so the</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="6.889">globalist the elite the central bankers</text>
  <text start="942.209" dur="6.42">they are still pushing their agenda and</text>
  <text start="945.679" dur="5.051">we can see at this point that the people</text>
  <text start="948.629" dur="6.661">around the world how are they going to</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="7.769">react to this now out in India we see</text>
  <text start="955.29" dur="6.269">things are rapidly falling apart they</text>
  <text start="958.499" dur="4.62">were pushing a casual society and we</text>
  <text start="961.559" dur="3.9">have to remember something about India</text>
  <text start="963.119" dur="4.62">is that most of the individuals they</text>
  <text start="965.459" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t have a cell phone they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="967.739" dur="5.07">the connection that we have here in the</text>
  <text start="971.669" dur="4.051">United States and many other countries</text>
  <text start="972.809" dur="4.65">where they&amp;#39;re able to use their cell</text>
  <text start="975.72" dur="4.589">phones that they&amp;#39;re able to get on to</text>
  <text start="977.459" dur="4.981">the internet they just don&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="980.309" dur="4.321">there and most Indians like smart</text>
  <text start="982.44" dur="4.53">phones and internet connections and e</text>
  <text start="984.63" dur="4.77">transactions have become a massive</text>
  <text start="986.97" dur="4.53">burden for them not only for the poor</text>
  <text start="989.4" dur="5.55">the literate people but even the</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="5.52">well-educated and India&amp;#39;s attempt to go</text>
  <text start="994.95" dur="7.47">cash as well it&amp;#39;s a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="997.02" dur="9.05">and the real pain is just beginning so</text>
  <text start="1002.42" dur="5.64">this whole cashless society not working</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="6.19">but the other thing they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1008.06" dur="5.94">pushing here is the tracking of those</text>
  <text start="1012.26" dur="3.9">individuals that were not in the banking</text>
  <text start="1014" dur="3.84">system that held cash that weren&amp;#39;t taxed</text>
  <text start="1016.16" dur="4.89">because they&amp;#39;re hiding their cash well</text>
  <text start="1017.84" dur="4.65">now they turn the cash in now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1021.05" dur="2.76">being tracked because they deposit it</text>
  <text start="1022.49" dur="4.5">into an account that was the only way</text>
  <text start="1023.81" dur="6.21">they could do this and like on cue the</text>
  <text start="1026.99" dur="6.69">Indian income tax department began</text>
  <text start="1030.02" dur="6.33">asking banks for data on their customers</text>
  <text start="1033.68" dur="7.11">bank deposits between April and November</text>
  <text start="1036.35" dur="7.469">how convenient so what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="1040.79" dur="5.37">that the poorest of the poor and the</text>
  <text start="1043.819" dur="5.611">previously on bank has now been duly</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="6.99">identified and they&amp;#39;re going to tax them</text>
  <text start="1049.43" dur="6.3">and we can see that they are pushing</text>
  <text start="1053.15" dur="4.77">this so they&amp;#39;re going for a Cancer</text>
