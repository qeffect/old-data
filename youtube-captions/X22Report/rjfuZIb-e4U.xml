  <text start="111.5" dur="6.299">pushing for a way to control the central</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="5.22">bank&amp;#39;s cue has been telling us that the</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="4.201">central bank will be restructured</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="6.03">we know that the central bank will also</text>
  <text start="122" dur="6.149">be brought down by using gold and cue</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="4.019">has also told us that the central banks</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="4.321">are going to increase rates dramatically</text>
  <text start="129.829" dur="5.761">in the year of 2019 which is this year</text>
  <text start="132.47" dur="6.9">and they said they already had a plan to</text>
  <text start="135.59" dur="8.04">stop this now the plan just couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="6.72">the Fed only it had to be other central</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="5.49">banks and I do believe going back in</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="6.06">time this is why Trump was contradicting</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="6.06">the central bank every time they</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="4.679">increase the rates he would blame them</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="4.47">for bringing the stock market down</text>
  <text start="156.829" dur="6.511">making the economy worse this was</text>
  <text start="159.65" dur="4.78">planned so every time the American</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="5.11">people hear the</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="6.929">rates moving up they correlated to the</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="5.099">central bank and it looks like Trump and</text>
  <text start="171.359" dur="5.541">Patriots they succeeded with this</text>
  <text start="173.549" dur="7.5">because what do we see today we see the</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="7.39">Patriots are completely controlling the</text>
  <text start="181.049" dur="5.131">central banking establishment because</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="3.63">the central bank establishment they do</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="3.69">not want to be exposed and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="3.33">talking about that in just a minute but</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="4.289">first let&amp;#39;s talk about what is happening</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="4.95">in the economy now Trump is pushing the</text>
  <text start="194.159" dur="5.22">narrative that the economy is fantastic</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="6.179">yes statistically the economy looks</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="6.33">incredible and like I said before he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.379" dur="5.76">using the weapons that the central</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="6.21">bank&amp;#39;s the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="208.139" dur="6.6">state used before he&amp;#39;s using the same</text>
  <text start="211.919" dur="4.47">exact statistical information and using</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="2.97">it against them this is why he</text>
  <text start="216.389" dur="3.901">continually makes announcements out</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="5.071">there saying look at our numbers if you</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.22">notice it&amp;#39;s always the numbers look at</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="5.849">our GDP look at our unemployment look at</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="4.74">the stock market because what have the</text>
  <text start="228.629" dur="3.57">mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.799">central banks has been doing over many</text>
  <text start="232.199" dur="6.72">many years they&amp;#39;ve been telling all of</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="7.65">us to look at these numbers and guess</text>
  <text start="238.919" dur="7.44">what he controls the narrative now he</text>
  <text start="242.699" dur="7.111">controls these numbers he has the magic</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="7.38">wand Trump tweeted out that aluminum</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="6.209">prices are down 12% since I instituted</text>
  <text start="253.739" dur="4.11">tariffs on aluminum dumping and the US</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="2.97">will be taking in billions plus jobs</text>
  <text start="257.849" dur="5.031">nice</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="7.411">yes Trump is bringing back jobs Trump is</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="8.02">completely resetting the entire economic</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="6.54">system and the last thing to do is to</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="3.84">get rid of all this debt now if we look</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="3.69">at the debt around the world we can see</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="5.01">it is absolutely horrific</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="5.7">remember the central banks they love</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="4.889">debt slaves they love people who have a</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="3.959">lot of debt you ever wonder why the</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="3.721">mainstream media and all these financial</text>
  <text start="286.289" dur="3.931">channels every time they report on</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="3.839">something say whoa credit card spending</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="2.86">is up that means things are really</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="3.46">really good</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="5.54">think about what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="295.659" dur="7.32">doing there convincing you that if you</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="7.21">increase your debt spending increases</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="6.301">because this is how they control the</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="6.72">population they believe that household</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="6.509">borrowing converts into household</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="6.839">spending and this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="315.789" dur="6.151">contributor to GDP remember they had to</text>
  <text start="319.389" dur="6.691">do this over the many many years because</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="8.129">if they didn&amp;#39;t the 70 percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="6.78">would look incredibly bad because think</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="6.09">about it strip away all credit strip</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="5.85">away the credit cards and let people use</text>
  <text start="336.159" dur="6.211">the fiat money that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="5.07">is printing what do you think the GDP</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="3.419">would look like what do you think the</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="5.609">spending would look like it would be</text>
  <text start="345.789" dur="6.331">absolutely horrible this is why they</text>
  <text start="349.389" dur="5.791">needed to continually push the idea that</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="5.549">debt is good oh whoa you want to buy</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="4.289">something no problem we have a store</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="3.99">credit card you don&amp;#39;t to make payments</text>

  <text start="369.729" dur="7.231">go up to twenty thirty forty percent</text>
  <text start="372.719" dur="7.29">boom they have you this is how they</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="6.78">trick the people around the world and</text>
  <text start="380.009" dur="7.03">they love people that are in debt I mean</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="5.22">right now the United States is number</text>

  <text start="440.889" dur="7.201">country and they&amp;#39;re the most in debt and</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="5.74">let me just say that this is what the</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="5.19">central bankers have been doing over all</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="7.709">these years putting countries putting</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="5.609">people into debt now it&amp;#39;s time to end</text>
  <text start="458.289" dur="4.44">this</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="7.02">the Patriots right now Trump Q team they</text>
  <text start="462.729" dur="4.801">are taking control of the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.909" dur="3.48">the narrative now they might not have</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="4.319">people in the inside actually</text>
  <text start="469.389" dur="5.851">controlling it but think about this for</text>
  <text start="471.849" dur="6.481">a second do you think the central bank</text>
  <text start="475.24" dur="7.109">the Rothschild central bank system do</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="8.209">you think they would back off crashing</text>
  <text start="482.349" dur="8.011">the economy if they were in control</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="7.271">why didn&amp;#39;t they proceed with their</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="6.089">mission q has told us they are planning</text>
  <text start="493.81" dur="6.63">to raise rates dramatically in 2019 not</text>
  <text start="496.449" dur="7.83">just the Fed the ECB was planning to</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="7.61">raise the rates in 2019 why did they</text>
  <text start="504.279" dur="7.8">back off what would be the purpose</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="7.929">because the central bankers they know if</text>
  <text start="512.079" dur="6.84">they proceeded with their mission to</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="5.781">raise the rates in 2019 why the economy</text>
  <text start="518.919" dur="7.381">looks fantastic they would be exposed</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="7.18">right now the ECB they&amp;#39;re rolling back</text>
  <text start="526.3" dur="4.17">everything that they said oh we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="3.12">to be raising interest rate so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="3.75">gonna do everything possible you know</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="5.16">what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re starting up</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="6.33">the printing presses again because they</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="7.729">know they cannot raise their rates right</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="9.09">now they know if they do the entire</text>
  <text start="544.949" dur="8.26">central bank establishment the ECB the</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="7.98">IMF the Biz the Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="553.209" dur="7.021">be completely exposed now many people</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="5.33">think well that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="6.03">the Patriots are controlling them really</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="5.74">think about this for a second there was</text>
  <text start="566.26" dur="4.98">going to be a coordinated effort between</text>
  <text start="568.69" dur="5.93">the central bank of the United States</text>
  <text start="571.24" dur="7.44">the Central Bank of Europe IMF and the</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="7.21">rest to bring down the world economy</text>
  <text start="578.68" dur="4.95">together this is why the mainstream</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="4.41">media was out there saying that there</text>
  <text start="583.63" dur="5.97">was going to be a recession in 2020 this</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="5.85">was the plan this is why Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="5.94">was out there saying yes we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="5.78">raising the interest rates then all of a</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="5.49">sudden when Q made that announcement</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="5.5">that they understand and they know the</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="5.46">plan and they&amp;#39;re taking action to</text>
  <text start="603.37" dur="6.66">prevent it all of a sudden we see the</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="5">central bank community well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.03" dur="6">reeling it all back</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="6.1">the ECB right now looks like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="3.81">even gonna raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="617.59" dur="3.54">yeah there&amp;#39;s talking about it but it</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="3.15">looks like it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="4.83">the Fed they&amp;#39;re just gonna wait</text>
  <text start="622.99" dur="4.59">patiently they even stopped unwinding</text>
  <text start="625.96" dur="5.01">their balance sheet didn&amp;#39;t they tell us</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="6.96">that this was gonna be on autopilot well</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="9.83">no longer why because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="9.63">that event because the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="4.78">controlling the narrative and the</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="2.52">Patriots can feel they say look at the</text>
  <text start="645.58" dur="4.31">economy look at the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="6.84">fantastic we&amp;#39;re doing fantastically and</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="5.8">if everything goes south it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="6.02">because of what we&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="655.69" dur="6.72">of what the central bank is going to do</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="4.87">because if they raise rates they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="4.44">ones who bring down the stock market if</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="4.53">they raise rates they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="666.85" dur="4.56">slow the economy if they raise rates</text>
  <text start="668.95" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re the ones who slow the global</text>
  <text start="671.41" dur="8.12">economy this is why the central banks</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="7.14">are holding off the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="679.53" dur="6.19">controlling pretty much everything right</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="6.71">now and once you have this control what</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="6.35">is the next move the next move is to</text>
  <text start="689.34" dur="4.4">bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="692.07" dur="4.26">establishment</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="5.59">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is yes we will</text>
  <text start="696.33" dur="5.4">have a crisis but the crisis is going to</text>
  <text start="699.33" dur="4.8">be blamed on the ECB the crisis is going</text>
  <text start="701.73" dur="4.71">to be blamed on the Fed the crisis is</text>
  <text start="704.13" dur="6.6">going to be blamed on the IMF the biz</text>
