  <text start="179.769" dur="5.611">everything has been pumped up with free</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="6.87">money people I mean you&amp;#39;re seeing prices</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="5.28">increase housing prices increase and we</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="3.71">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen sooner or</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="4.2">later this bubble will pop and</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="5.229">everything will come crashing down and</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="4.77">again we have to understand before this</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="3.991">happens these private western central</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="5.22">bankers what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re going to have a an event that</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="6.05">will take all eyes off of them and place</text>
  <text start="208" dur="6.54">it on another country to cover up this</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="7.899">ginormous horrific collapse which is</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="7.14">coming now we have more indication that</text>
  <text start="218.799" dur="5.011">the economy is not doing well and I talk</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="4.529">a lot about retail how that is</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="4.62">completely imploding I talk about real</text>
  <text start="226.209" dur="4.471">estate how the big players are getting</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="4.38">out of the real estate market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="3.72">laying off thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="232.81" dur="3.149">people in their mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="3.089">because they understand the American</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="3.771">people are just pretty much tapped out</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="5.581">but we&amp;#39;re seeing the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="6.43">again and it is dropping this is the</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="6.509">ninth day in a row the worst first</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="4.889">quarter in over ten years and for those</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="4.321">people who don&amp;#39;t know what the Baltic</text>
  <text start="251.049" dur="4.621">Dry Index is it gives investors insight</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.679">into global supply and demand trends</text>
  <text start="255.67" dur="5.36">this change is often considered a lead</text>
  <text start="258.579" dur="4.891">indicator of future economic growth or</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="5.259">contraction because the good ship are</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="4.92">raw pre-production material which is</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="4.741">typically an area with very low levels</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="5.059">of speculation and right now the Baltic</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="5.83">Dry is down 25 /</text>
  <text start="273.449" dur="5.791">sent in the last two weeks back near</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="5.109">post-crisis lows and has just suffered</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="5.69">the worst start to a year in over a</text>
  <text start="281.969" dur="7.741">decade so I mean if we just look around</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="7.69">we can see that all the different areas</text>
  <text start="289.71" dur="6.72">of the economy are not doing well except</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="6.569">for that area where the bank the Fed is</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="5.669">pumping up and that is the stock market</text>
  <text start="299.189" dur="5.461">which has been as that the S&amp;amp;P the Dow</text>
  <text start="302.099" dur="5.611">all being pumped up and that&amp;#39;s moving up</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="5.009">the banks are receiving cash from the</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="3.72">Fed they&amp;#39;re buying up all their toxic</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="3.48">real estate and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="4.199">doing this they haven&amp;#39;t really stopped</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="5.941">this they are still pumping billions</text>
  <text start="315.629" dur="6.9">upon billions of dollars into the banks</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="6.509">every single month and all I really did</text>
  <text start="322.529" dur="6.241">was they diverted some of their funds</text>
  <text start="325.589" dur="5.67">over to Belgium to pick up the slack for</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="5.609">Treasury bond purchasing so it looks</text>
  <text start="331.259" dur="5.13">like the Fed is absolutely doing nothing</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="4.62">with Treasury bonds that were slowing</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="5.911">down our pace of purchasing and all they</text>
  <text start="338.999" dur="5.07">really did was shift of where this money</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="3.75">is going to be used to purchase these</text>
  <text start="344.069" dur="4.08">Treasury bonds and I discussed this in</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="4.709">another report but we can see what</text>
  <text start="348.149" dur="4.531">exactly what is happening this whole</text>
  <text start="350.759" dur="4.291">entire thing is an illusion of course we</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="5">had this jobs report out and we realize</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="5.669">that these are completely fake falsified</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="5.019">these numbers make absolutely no sense</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="3.54">compared to what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="3.8">industry and I discussed as many many</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="5.041">times and we can see this all over and</text>
  <text start="366.499" dur="6.04">again we have to remember they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="7.5">all of this to make you believe that</text>
  <text start="372.539" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re in some type of recovery because</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re out there continually telling us</text>
  <text start="378.839" dur="3.6">that you know unemployment&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="380.339" dur="3.75">better the stock market&amp;#39;s going up look</text>
  <text start="382.439" dur="3.66">at this we can&amp;#39;t go bad it will never</text>
  <text start="384.089" dur="5.16">come down it&amp;#39;s going to keep going up we</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="5.82">might hit 20,000 and they continually</text>
  <text start="389.249" dur="4.65">push gold down push push push to show</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="3.77">that you know gold is not really</text>
  <text start="393.899" dur="4.711">reacting sees we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="395.689" dur="5.89">everything is fine because eventually as</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="5.099">we all know they will create this event</text>
  <text start="401.579" dur="5.221">this event will start we&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
  <text start="403.709" dur="3.631">world war three and they do believe that</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="2.94">when this will</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="5.19">was over they will take control again of</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="5.37">the entire system they&amp;#39;ll have the</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="4.83">ability to create new currency so this</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="4.35">debt problem will go away they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="5.64">restart it but what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="6.39">at this point is re-educate the young</text>
  <text start="423" dur="4.71">people of today because really what they</text>
  <text start="425.85" dur="3.78">want and I&amp;#39;m talking about the central</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="3.72">bankers the elite the globalist whatever</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="4.89">you like to call them what they really</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="5.34">want is the younger generation not to</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.74">understand their rights not to</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="4.02">understand the Constitution actually</text>
  <text start="439.26" dur="4.98">they would like to get rid of it at this</text>
  <text start="440.79" dur="6.87">point and we can see right now what they</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="5.489">are doing we all understand that the</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="4.92">government created now remember the</text>
  <text start="449.729" dur="5.461">government created common core and they</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="4.41">want all states to be in on it and if</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="3.84">you don&amp;#39;t use it you do not get the</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="5.01">money from the federal government so all</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="4.74">states are in some of them are saying</text>
  <text start="462" dur="3.63">wait we&amp;#39;re looking at this and this is</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="4.58">just absolutely ridiculous because we</text>
  <text start="465.63" dur="6.659">have to understand common core is</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="8.5">developed to re-educate the youth of</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="6.69">America and their first objective is to</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="5.16">completely rewrite the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="5.31">their second objective is to rewrite the</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="4.529">First Amendment and to change some of</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="3.81">the history now when everyone thinks of</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="3.771">Common Core they think oh it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="488.099" dur="5.851">textbook now there&amp;#39;s many many different</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="5.59">Common Core textbooks there&amp;#39;s many they</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="4.14">have to be approved of course by carbon</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="4.05">core the federal government and they</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="4.29">have to they have to have certain</text>
  <text start="499.95" dur="6.12">guidelines that they have to follow and</text>
  <text start="502.38" dur="6.39">they have to be in compliant with the</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="4.56">curriculum for common core and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.77" dur="4.98">coming out now is we&amp;#39;re seeing many of</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="5.88">these books really tell different</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="4.589">stories of what the rights are of the</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="3.18">people and if we go back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="518.339" dur="5.041">thirteen ever since the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="6.21">came into power from the history books</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="6.54">from that time what they did was they</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="7.47">space completely removed how money is</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="5.46">created they completely removed what the</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="4.11">responsibility was of the government to</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="5.19">coin money all of that was completely</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="3.59">taken out after 1913 because prior</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="2.87">tonight</text>
  <text start="541.07" dur="3.87">13 we had this so they were re-educating</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="4.32">the population during this time period</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="5.13">so people wouldn&amp;#39;t be the wiser of</text>
  <text start="547.76" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s going on and in the textbooks</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="3.9">right now approved by the common core of</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="4.38">course for use by students studying for</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="3.78">Advanced Placement history exam the</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="5.19">Second Amendment and this is the</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="5.33">Advanced Placement the AP History the</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="4.26">Second Amendment is defined in this way</text>
  <text start="563.08" dur="5.26">the people have the right to keep and</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="4.98">bear arms in a state militia okay now</text>
  <text start="568.34" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s the advanced history class now in</text>
  <text start="570.53" dur="5.79">another common core book which is</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="5.25">approved there there is a another</text>
  <text start="576.32" dur="4.1">statement they made about the Second</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="5.07">Amendment and they define it as this</text>
  <text start="580.42" dur="4.93">citizens have the right to bear arms as</text>
  <text start="583.01" dur="5.58">member of a militia of a citizen</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="6.12">soldiers okay of course these two have</text>
  <text start="588.59" dur="4.98">our are completely wrong this is not the</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="3.84">Second Amendment but you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="3.36">continually rewriting this as we go</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="2.43">along and each book says something a</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="3.48">little different because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="4.23">educating the youth of America and then</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="3.27">there are other like worksheets that</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve come out with for common core</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="5.31">that history teachers are going to use</text>
  <text start="606.11" dur="7.74">and some of these say I&amp;#39;ll give you an</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="6.69">example this one has to do with the Bill</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="3.51">of Rights the government of the United</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="3.75">States is currently revisiting the Bill</text>
  <text start="617.36" dur="4.68">of Rights they determined that it is out</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="5.55">diet outdated and may not remain in its</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="5.79">current form any longer and we will have</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="5.13">the right to change it well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="5.1">right because all the states there has</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="4.86">to be a consensus of a certain number of</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="4.2">states to add a change in amendment and</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="3.99">you can&amp;#39;t remove the rights because the</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="4.53">rights the the people are born with the</text>

  <text start="1089.769" dur="7.671">that you&amp;#39;re making instead of receiving</text>
  <text start="1091.33" dur="8.939">more contributions and more gifts from</text>
  <text start="1097.44" dur="5.95">contributors and things like that all</text>
  <text start="1100.269" dur="6.091">right let&amp;#39;s move on here now the US Navy</text>
  <text start="1103.39" dur="4.47">has developed I shouldn&amp;#39;t say they</text>
  <text start="1106.36" dur="4.14">developed but another company has</text>
  <text start="1107.86" dur="6.15">developed a piece of software that they</text>
  <text start="1110.5" dur="6.75">can place into any helicopter which will</text>
  <text start="1114.01" dur="6.36">allow it to become a drone they can fly</text>
  <text start="1117.25" dur="5.789">it and it has some type of artificial</text>
  <text start="1120.37" dur="4.919">intelligence where it they eventually</text>
  <text start="1123.039" dur="4.77">wanted to land where they wanted to land</text>
  <text start="1125.289" dur="4.471">it can hover it can maneuver right now</text>
  <text start="1127.809" dur="3.72">they control it with a tablet but</text>
  <text start="1129.76" dur="4.95">eventually they want to expand on this</text>
  <text start="1131.529" dur="6.03">where the where the helicopter will be</text>
  <text start="1134.71" dur="4.38">able to maneuver and land wherever it</text>
  <text start="1137.559" dur="5.131">needs to do it on its own without</text>
  <text start="1139.09" dur="6.12">someone controlling it and again DHS is</text>
  <text start="1142.69" dur="5.03">looking at this other agencies are</text>
  <text start="1145.21" dur="4.86">looking at this technology to place</text>
  <text start="1147.72" dur="5.38">drones in the air because it would be</text>
  <text start="1150.07" dur="5.31">great to have a helicopter drone flying</text>
  <text start="1153.1" dur="5.37">around the neighborhoods where it could</text>
  <text start="1155.38" dur="5.49">stop in midair point down take pictures</text>
  <text start="1158.47" dur="5.01">or shoot some type of weapon and we can</text>
  <text start="1160.87" dur="4.5">see why all this is happening and where</text>
  <text start="1163.48" dur="4.47">they are moving at this point because we</text>
  <text start="1165.37" dur="5.73">understand the DHS is not for the people</text>
  <text start="1167.95" dur="4.68">DHS is to control the people when this</text>
  <text start="1171.1" dur="4.079">collapse comes and it will be a lot</text>
  <text start="1172.63" dur="5.37">easier if they can disarm every single</text>
  <text start="1175.179" dur="4.86">person at this time and completely</text>
  <text start="1178" dur="3.929">educate the people that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1180.039" dur="3.091">these rights anymore because if you</text>
  <text start="1181.929" dur="2.671">really look at some of the laws that are</text>

  <text start="1355.33" dur="4.98">in counter measures and we understand</text>
  <text start="1357.61" dur="4.74">they want them to do something the</text>
  <text start="1360.31" dur="4.44">United States central bankers the EU</text>

  <text start="1375.01" dur="5.37">to have this done as quickly as they</text>
  <text start="1377.26" dur="5.22">possibly can now Tokyo is out there</text>
  <text start="1380.38" dur="4.05">saying that we understand the North</text>
  <text start="1382.48" dur="4.77">Korea is firing mid-range ballistic</text>
  <text start="1384.43" dur="5.07">missiles and Japan has promised to use</text>
  <text start="1387.25" dur="4.32">one of destroyers in the Sea of Japan to</text>
  <text start="1389.5" dur="4.2">shoot these missiles down we understand</text>

  <text start="1401.08" dur="3.33">North Korea we have the missile shield</text>
  <text start="1402.73" dur="4.8">in Europe we have the pivot to Asia</text>
  <text start="1404.41" dur="5.31">where basis surrounding China we have I</text>
  <text start="1407.53" dur="4.41">guess I&amp;#39;ll call it the pivot to Russia</text>
  <text start="1409.72" dur="4.74">now because they&amp;#39;re setting up all</text>
  <text start="1411.94" dur="5.16">military assets surrounding Russia at</text>
  <text start="1414.46" dur="6.15">this time and we can see how all of this</text>
  <text start="1417.1" dur="5.91">is starting to come about because they</text>
  <text start="1420.61" dur="6.9">understand eventually one way or another</text>
  <text start="1423.01" dur="6.96">they will start World War three now we</text>
  <text start="1427.51" dur="6.39">understand in Ukraine Crimea had a</text>
  <text start="1429.97" dur="5.82">referendum and they decided they do not</text>
  <text start="1433.9" dur="3.72">want to be part of Ukraine anymore</text>
  <text start="1435.79" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re part of Russia now there are a</text>
  <text start="1437.62" dur="4.79">thousand protesters that have gathered</text>
  <text start="1439.36" dur="5.4">in East Ukraine city of Donetsk and</text>

  <text start="1447.28" dur="6.48">they want to vote to see to completely</text>
  <text start="1450.61" dur="5.85">succeed from Ukraine so we can see this</text>
  <text start="1453.76" dur="5.67">whole coup d&amp;#39;etat in Ukraine is kind of</text>
  <text start="1456.46" dur="6.06">falling apart at this point so this</text>
  <text start="1459.43" dur="5.79">tells you that they are losing the</text>
  <text start="1462.52" dur="5.34">battle in Ukraine they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1465.22" dur="6.36">moving to different areas to start and</text>
  <text start="1467.86" dur="5.67">to bring an event your tuna to the</text>
  <text start="1471.58" dur="3.99">United States now it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1473.53" dur="3.9">matter where this comes from at this</text>
  <text start="1475.57" dur="3.81">point if it comes from sir</text>
  <text start="1477.43" dur="3.66">riya if or if it comes from Russia or</text>
  <text start="1479.38" dur="4.17">China because I&amp;#39;ve said this many times</text>
  <text start="1481.09" dur="5.4">all the players are pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="1483.55" dur="5.25">and we understand that because of these</text>
  <text start="1486.49" dur="4.11">sanctions which were not really placed</text>
  <text start="1488.8" dur="4.8">on Russia they were placed on</text>
  <text start="1490.6" dur="7.83">individuals Russia started to escalate</text>
  <text start="1493.6" dur="7.11">and push their agenda forward in what</text>
  <text start="1498.43" dur="5.87">they were doing with the ruble not using</text>
  <text start="1500.71" dur="6.51">the dollar and we can see that Russia is</text>
  <text start="1504.3" dur="5.17">making deals with China making deals</text>
  <text start="1507.22" dur="4.23">with India making deals with North Korea</text>
  <text start="1509.47" dur="4.11">Iran all by passing the dollar right now</text>
  <text start="1511.45" dur="4.53">and the United States is out there that</text>
  <text start="1513.58" dur="4.2">the and they&amp;#39;re warning Russia right now</text>
  <text start="1515.98" dur="4.8">because they&amp;#39;re making deals by passing</text>
  <text start="1517.78" dur="6.03">the dollar US has warned Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="1520.78" dur="4.8">against possible oil barter deal and we</text>
  <text start="1523.81" dur="3.45">have to remember that Russia has made a</text>
  <text start="1525.58" dur="4.11">deal with Syria Russia has made a deal</text>
  <text start="1527.26" dur="4.35">with Iran to help with their natural</text>
  <text start="1529.69" dur="3.9">resources that will completely bypass</text>
  <text start="1531.61" dur="4.02">the US dollar at this point and Russia</text>
  <text start="1533.59" dur="4.55">has also made a deal with Iran to supply</text>
  <text start="1535.63" dur="5.42">them with military assets at this time</text>
  <text start="1538.14" dur="8.23">US says any such deal would trigger</text>
  <text start="1541.05" dur="7.3">sanctions US has convened conveyed</text>
  <text start="1546.37" dur="5.04">concerns to Iranian government through</text>
  <text start="1548.35" dur="5.55">all channels and again they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1551.41" dur="4.14">the agenda forward and right now the</text>
  <text start="1553.9" dur="4.14">voice of russia is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1555.55" dur="4.23">russia prepares to attack the petro</text>
  <text start="1558.04" dur="4.02">dollar which they are pretty much doing</text>
  <text start="1559.78" dur="5.24">at this time they&amp;#39;re making all these</text>
  <text start="1562.06" dur="6.24">deals making preparations to pretty much</text>
  <text start="1565.02" dur="5.02">remove the US dollar from everything</text>
  <text start="1568.3" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re doing china is doing the same</text>
  <text start="1570.04" dur="4.16">thing other countries are now doing the</text>
  <text start="1573.13" dur="4.61">same thing and I&amp;#39;ve said this before</text>
  <text start="1574.2" dur="9.13">when other just remember why the dollar</text>
  <text start="1577.74" dur="7.81">is being why it has such high value</text>
  <text start="1583.33" dur="5.61">maybe not right now but it has such high</text>
  <text start="1585.55" dur="6.9">value because all the countries across</text>
  <text start="1588.94" dur="7.05">the globe needed to keep US dollars in</text>
  <text start="1592.45" dur="6.78">reserve and they continually push this</text>
  <text start="1595.99" dur="6.17">to more and more countries because when</text>
  <text start="1599.23" dur="6.75">the Middle Eastern African countries</text>
  <text start="1602.16" dur="7.15">they would sell their oil they had to</text>
  <text start="1605.98" dur="4.35">use US dollars so all of these countries</text>
  <text start="1609.31" dur="3.57">needed to take</text>
  <text start="1610.33" dur="5.37">more US dollars and keep them in their</text>
  <text start="1612.88" dur="5.31">reserves now with all these deals going</text>
  <text start="1615.7" dur="5.64">across the globe with China making deals</text>
  <text start="1618.19" dur="5.489">by passing the dollar Russia making</text>
  <text start="1621.34" dur="4.35">deals by passing the dollar natural</text>
  <text start="1623.679" dur="4.86">resources being sold not using the</text>
  <text start="1625.69" dur="5.25">dollars countries no longer need to hold</text>
  <text start="1628.539" dur="4.5">on to these dollars if they no longer</text>
  <text start="1630.94" dur="4.92">need to hold on to these dollars these</text>
  <text start="1633.039" dur="5.041">dollars then come back to the United</text>
  <text start="1635.86" dur="5.429">States that means there are more dollars</text>
  <text start="1638.08" dur="6.719">in circulation that means the value of</text>
  <text start="1641.289" dur="5.671">your dollar decreases and this is what</text>
  <text start="1644.799" dur="5.941">we&amp;#39;re seeing happening because the</text>
  <text start="1646.96" dur="6.3">direct threat to the dollar is in Africa</text>
  <text start="1650.74" dur="5.669">with China they have how clearing house</text>
  <text start="1653.26" dur="5.46">in Kenya most of the African nations now</text>
  <text start="1656.409" dur="4.5">are starting to reverse their reserves</text>
  <text start="1658.72" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re putting in more you want</text>
  <text start="1660.909" dur="6.63">removing the dollar in Libya we</text>
  <text start="1664.69" dur="4.979">understand the al Qaeda militants the</text>
  <text start="1667.539" dur="3.301">rebels these are actually the people but</text>
  <text start="1669.669" dur="3.331">the United States likes to call them</text>
  <text start="1670.84" dur="4.17">terrorists on the other hand in Syria</text>
  <text start="1673" dur="5.669">the rebels the paid mercenaries are</text>
  <text start="1675.01" dur="6.799">fighting with al-qaeda against Assad so</text>
  <text start="1678.669" dur="5.37">they play both sides al Qaeda in</text>
  <text start="1681.809" dur="3.49">countries they&amp;#39;ve already taken over and</text>
  <text start="1684.039" dur="2.821">have a puppet government in there are</text>
  <text start="1685.299" dur="4.051">the terrorists but they&amp;#39;re actually the</text>
  <text start="1686.86" dur="5.159">people fighting back to take back their</text>
  <text start="1689.35" dur="5.73">country the Libyan people there try to</text>
  <text start="1692.019" dur="5.221">sell the oil by passing the dollar but</text>
  <text start="1695.08" dur="4.89">we saw what happened they stopped the</text>
  <text start="1697.24" dur="5.909">ship US forces boarded it brought it</text>
  <text start="1699.97" dur="6.51">back and the sale never went through and</text>
  <text start="1703.149" dur="6.571">we can see when most of the countries</text>
  <text start="1706.48" dur="4.86">now decide and continually push forward</text>
  <text start="1709.72" dur="4.709">and remove the puppet government and</text>
  <text start="1711.34" dur="5.64">place the oil not using the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1714.429" dur="5.311">anymore and allow this oil to be sold</text>
  <text start="1716.98" dur="5.27">using other currencies this will be the</text>
  <text start="1719.74" dur="5.399">demise of the dollar and we see that</text>
  <text start="1722.25" dur="4.75">United States is losing ground in this</text>
  <text start="1725.139" dur="3.981">fight they&amp;#39;re losing it in Libya they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1729.12" dur="5.2">Apache helicopters there this is why the</text>
  <text start="1732.01" dur="5.49">United States is creating this special</text>
  <text start="1734.32" dur="6.51">commando force to go after al-qaeda in</text>

  <text start="1743.98" dur="7.47">Lebanon Libya Iraq in Sudan in central</text>

  <text start="1758.89" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t really make their case to reinvent</text>
  <text start="1761.38" dur="4.59">rees at this time and they need to</text>
  <text start="1763.24" dur="6.059">maintain the status quo and keep the US</text>
  <text start="1765.97" dur="6.449">dollar in place with the private western</text>
