  <text start="37.72" dur="4.89">fifteenth 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="40.36" dur="4.83">episode is that fed is a potential</text>
  <text start="42.61" dur="5.55">threat to the financial stability of the</text>
  <text start="45.19" dur="6">US let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.16" dur="6.63">collapse financial news now today we see</text>
  <text start="51.19" dur="4.98">the market did not finish up today they</text>
  <text start="54.79" dur="4.199">didn&amp;#39;t get their happy ending for the</text>
  <text start="56.17" dur="5.73">weekend and we see the suppression of</text>
  <text start="58.989" dur="4.53">gold didn&amp;#39;t work out as well as they</text>
  <text start="61.9" dur="4.14">thought was going to happen because we</text>
  <text start="63.519" dur="6.301">see right now gold is back up once again</text>
  <text start="66.04" dur="5.31">and as we move forward we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="69.82" dur="3.089">see a lot more of this and this is an</text>
  <text start="71.35" dur="4.29">indicator and when gold starts to shoot</text>
  <text start="72.909" dur="5.491">up by fifty sixty seventy eighty dollars</text>
  <text start="75.64" dur="6.089">this is when you say hmm something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.4" dur="5.55">going on here maybe I should buy some</text>
  <text start="81.729" dur="5.761">gold and silver maybe I should buy some</text>
  <text start="83.95" dur="7.17">more food supplies weapons keep cash on</text>
  <text start="87.49" dur="4.8">hand because at that point things going</text>
  <text start="91.12" dur="2.46">to be rapidly getting out of control</text>
  <text start="92.29" dur="3.72">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="93.58" dur="4.5">that the American people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="96.01" dur="3.48">really buying that this economy is doing</text>
  <text start="98.08" dur="3.36">well even though the president&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="3.53">there and the Fed is out there telling</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="3.65">us that everything is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re seeing strengthen the economy</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="5.61">you know employments good we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="108.07" dur="5.4">housings good retail is strong and</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="4.63">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="113.47" dur="5.46">and talking about is completely the</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="5.28">opposite of what the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="118.93" dur="3.81">central bank the president is talking</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="4.68">about and we see more and more</text>
  <text start="122.74" dur="4.23">indicators showing us that things are</text>
  <text start="125.29" dur="4.589">still rapidly falling apart and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.97" dur="5.19">see any signs that this is going to turn</text>
  <text start="129.879" dur="4.651">around at all actually we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="4.98">accelerating to the downside and not the</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.09">upside here and when we look at some of</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="5.94">the polls that measure you know consumer</text>
  <text start="140.62" dur="6.479">sentiment how do you think the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="6.21">doing we see that people are saying we</text>
  <text start="147.099" dur="4.261">don&amp;#39;t believe the economy&amp;#39;s doing well I</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="5.13">mean you Mitch they thought they were</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="3.959">going to push this up to 92 they thought</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re gonna have with this incredible</text>
  <text start="155.319" dur="4.711">rebound from 91 and people were going to</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.85">see the economy that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="6.84">but it dropped to 89.7 so it comes</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="5.31">we missed and the reason for the drop is</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.28">that consumers are reporting a slowdown</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="5.43">in expected wage gains weakening</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="5.84">inflation adjusted income expectations</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="6.3">growing concerns that the economy is</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="5.4">slowing right now and the pace of job</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="5.43">creation is kind of non-existent and</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="5.8">then we look at the Gallup poll which is</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="5.55">a poll done by Gallup and it&amp;#39;s surveys</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="4.89">people and this is their weekly economic</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="4.65">confidence poll and it&amp;#39;s showing that</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="7.02">the confidence in the US economy is</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="7.77">getting worse the poll asked people to</text>
  <text start="201.1" dur="5.94">rate the economy and is it getting</text>
  <text start="204.46" dur="6.15">better is it getting worse and it turns</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="6">out that everyday people are not very</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="5.34">excited about the US economy and the</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="7.2">index ending the week of April 10th came</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="7.83">in at negative 14 down from the prior</text>
  <text start="220.24" dur="6.66">week so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in</text>
  <text start="223.78" dur="6.09">the prior week was around negative 10 so</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re continually dropping it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="5.67">getting better it&amp;#39;s actually getting</text>
  <text start="233.02" dur="4.14">worse and the conditions are getting</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="5.4">worse and we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="7.23">layoffs Intel right now they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.34">to cut thousands of jobs this spring and</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="3.89">they&amp;#39;re going to reduce the head count</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="3.72">in a lot of their business units and</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="3.58">we&amp;#39;re going to see double-digit</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.68">percentage here because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="5.37">saying is the job cuts are going to be</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="4.16">much larger than they were last year</text>
  <text start="257.23" dur="4.59">when they eliminated about 1,100 people</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="5.62">so we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="5.46">say okay we need to let these people go</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="5.55">and I say once again where is everyone</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="4.08">going to find a job we know the</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="4.44">restaurant performance index is</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.47">continually dropping that means less</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="4.17">unless people are going to restaurants</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="4.77">the traffic is drying up and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="4.98">to start to see a slowdown in hiring for</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="6.569">waiters bartenders waitresses and so on</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="7.4">so where are these jobs going to come</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="7.901">from and remember these are high paying</text>
  <text start="291" dur="5.51">jobs where they had good benefits</text>
  <text start="295.07" dur="3.47">and now they&amp;#39;re going to be looking for</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="4.83">these same jobs but they&amp;#39;re non-existent</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="5.62">they just don&amp;#39;t exist out there anymore</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="4.64">I know they keep telling us they do but</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.89">there are so many people writing in</text>
  <text start="305.98" dur="6.76">saying that I got laid off or I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="5.55">graduate and I cannot find work actually</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to even go through</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="4.68">the job listings because there&amp;#39;s no jobs</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="4.56">in my area and when I do send out a</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="5.61">resume if I&amp;#39;m lucky enough I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="322.01" dur="5.34">get a response so we see at this point</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="4.2">things are really breaking down now</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more indicators</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="3.6">flashing red signals letting us know</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="5.61">that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="7.89">and we see industrial production it is</text>
  <text start="336.47" dur="9.66">dropped again year-on-year this is the</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="9.45">seventh month in a row and the last time</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="7.89">we&amp;#39;ve seen something like this so bad we</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="5.76">were already in a recession so we are</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="4.02">down two percent year-on-year in March</text>
  <text start="355.79" dur="6.72">this is the weakest since December and</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="8.49">down point six month on month and the</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="7.59">output for factories is continually</text>
  <text start="366.53" dur="7.77">plunging what we&amp;#39;re seeing is vehicle</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="6.09">production has brought this down because</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="6.45">as we&amp;#39;ve been talking about used car</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="7.35">prices their prices are falling which</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="7.08">has an effect on new cars people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="6.33">buying new cars so we see at this point</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="9.62">that the factory orders are starting to</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="10.77">slow and this is as bad as March of 2008</text>
  <text start="397.45" dur="9.7">that&amp;#39;s where at at this point we&amp;#39;re back</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="11.19">to 2008 with industrial production we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.15" dur="8.43">following the same path here now we</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="6.42">understand Atlanta has their model of</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="4.53">estimating the GDP and we know GDP is</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="4.23">not the true GDP because they throw like</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="4.14">Obamacare in inventory to pump it up and</text>
  <text start="422.48" dur="4.05">if we really look at the calculation for</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="4.889">GDP we most likely in the negative</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="5.039">region at this point but even with</text>
  <text start="429.139" dur="7.261">all that thrown in there models are only</text>
  <text start="431.569" dur="6.271">showing a point 1 2.3 percent gdp the</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="4.919">new york fed while they came out with</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="13.02">their model and they already dropped</text>
  <text start="441.319" dur="12">their forecasts from 1.9 to 1.0 so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="7.589">just getting worse and worse and for the</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="8.19">u.s. to hit the Fed target to hit their</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="4.951">predictions the US has to grow</text>
  <text start="461.509" dur="5.071">three-point-four percent in the second</text>
  <text start="463.4" dur="7.229">half now can the u.s. do this out of</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="7.35">nowhere most likely not can the</text>
  <text start="470.629" dur="5.371">government and the central bank step in</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="4.949">and manipulate the numbers and push</text>
  <text start="476" dur="4.71">obamacare information and inventory</text>
  <text start="478.879" dur="3.66">information and anything else they want</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.15">to throw into the calculation and remove</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="5.4">it from other quarters and throw it into</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="5.639">this one most likely yes but how much</text>
  <text start="487.939" dur="4.021">manipulation can they do until people</text>
  <text start="489.499" dur="4.2">say whoa hey we know what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="4.319">already a lot of people are already</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="4.89">calling them out saying we know what</text>
  <text start="496.279" dur="5.76">you&amp;#39;re doing here and it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="498.589" dur="5.85">make sense anymore but again what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="5.011">seeing right now is the tikl information</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="4.921">from the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="5.969">it&amp;#39;s moving further and further away</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="6.57">from reality and at a certain point that</text>
  <text start="513.019" dur="5.221">people are going to say okay what is</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="3.719">going on here and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="518.24" dur="3.959">starting to wake up because we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="519.649" dur="5.761">it with you Mitch and gallop saying the</text>
  <text start="522.199" dur="5.601">economy is not strong so no one is</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="5.19">really believing the president anymore</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="4.69">everyone&amp;#39;s trying to look at the economy</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="3.69">and saying I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="3.779">the truth at this point and we know</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="5.43">politicians they don&amp;#39;t tell the truth</text>
  <text start="536.269" dur="5.791">they just continually lie now on april</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="4.5">first 2016 the china central bank</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="4.05">governor he announced that the chinese</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="6.78">government will take actions to promote</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="8.539">the new sdrs that the one is going to be</text>
  <text start="551" dur="6.449">included in for its domestic economy and</text>
  <text start="554.649" dur="5.44">the announcement was made at the end of</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="5.671">the meeting of the g20 in Paris which is</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="5.641">hosted by China this year</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="6.15">and China will start to use both the US</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="5.94">dollar and STRs REM reporting its</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="4.41">foreign reserves so it looks like</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re going to be removing the dollar</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="6.99">and using other baskets of currency</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="10.68">within the STRs at this point we also</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="9.89">see that the gold back you won will be</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="6.57">going into effect on April nineteenth</text>

  <text start="597.38" dur="5.81">the 18 members to join the new</text>
  <text start="599.63" dur="6.03">yuan-denominated gold benchmark that</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="5.71">signals China&amp;#39;s biggest step towards</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="6.09">making the yuan convertible by creating</text>
  <text start="608.9" dur="5.79">a you wan base gold fix this is a</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="5.67">backdoor to floating the one itself it</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="5.399">will allow for arbitrage and currency so</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="4.68">you can go long or short golden dollars</text>
  <text start="620.089" dur="5.181">and the opposite in you want and you</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="6.989">have then created a you won futures</text>
  <text start="625.27" dur="6.58">contract and we see that they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="629.089" dur="6.661">their way from everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="5.64">been talking about previously and we can</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="3.72">see that they&amp;#39;re trying to push out the</text>
  <text start="637.49" dur="3.39">you wan or try it we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="639.47" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re trying to push the one as a</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="4.74">reserve currency it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="5.07">included in the STRs and they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="645.62" dur="3.93">in that general direction because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="4.349">starting to see that everything is</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="6.51">moving from the west to the east at this</text>
  <text start="652.279" dur="7.011">point now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="6.18">deutsche bank they were exposed in</text>
  <text start="659.29" dur="6">manipulating gold and silver they came</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="6.39">clean now we have LIBOR gold silver and</text>
  <text start="665.29" dur="6.43">Deutsche Bank said it would expose other</text>
  <text start="668.63" dur="6.68">banks in rigging the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="5.61">market and we can see that at this point</text>
  <text start="675.31" dur="4.779">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at in</text>
  <text start="677.33" dur="5.759">the economy we&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="680.089" dur="4.081">that it is completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="683.089" dur="4.831">everything that we talked about in the</text>
  <text start="684.17" dur="6.39">past is all now coming true when</text>
  <text start="687.92" dur="4.169">everyone continually said no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.56" dur="2.91">impossible they don&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="692.089" dur="4.891">interest rates they don&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="693.47" dur="5.46">gold and silver that&amp;#39;s just crazy talk</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that yeah they</text>

  <text start="707.54" dur="4.68">is driven by the central bank itself and</text>
  <text start="710.72" dur="5.34">what&amp;#39;s very interesting we talked about</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="5.22">how the FDIC came out and the Federal</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="3.959">Reserve came out saying that the bangs</text>
  <text start="717.44" dur="6.03">aren&amp;#39;t ready for a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="720.019" dur="6.301">they released a 19-page letter issued to</text>

  <text start="726.32" dur="6.449">of JPMorgan Chase in April twelfth</text>
  <text start="729.459" dur="7.091">saying that they do not have a credible</text>
  <text start="732.769" dur="7.68">plan for winding itself down in a bank</text>
  <text start="736.55" dur="6.06">crisis if the bank failed and the letter</text>
  <text start="740.449" dur="5.521">actually carried a frightening passage</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="6.15">and large blocks of like redacted</text>
  <text start="745.97" dur="5.809">material in critical areas but one of</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="7.949">the major things that it said is that</text>
  <text start="751.779" dur="7.091">JPMorgan could pose a threat not to the</text>
  <text start="756.709" dur="5.011">shareholders or wall street or the</text>
  <text start="758.87" dur="5.579">markets it said the potential threat was</text>
  <text start="761.72" dur="7.859">to the financial stability of the United</text>
  <text start="764.449" dur="7.411">States actually the Fed poses a</text>
  <text start="769.579" dur="5.07">potential threat to the financial</text>
  <text start="771.86" dur="5.37">stability of the United States as we are</text>
  <text start="774.649" dur="5.31">now seeing how everything is unfolding</text>
  <text start="777.23" dur="6.75">because you have to remember they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="779.959" dur="8.581">control of this system they created this</text>
  <text start="783.98" dur="6.9">system so if one of the banks is a</text>
  <text start="788.54" dur="5.549">potential threat so is the central bank</text>
  <text start="790.88" dur="5.63">and they&amp;#39;re very worried about the</text>
  <text start="794.089" dur="5.791">derivatives they&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="796.51" dur="6.04">do they have enough cash on hand and I</text>
  <text start="799.88" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t think the banks are that worried</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="4.019">or the central bank is that worried I</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="3.99">know maybe the agencies within the</text>
  <text start="806.569" dur="2.88">government are worried but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="808.22" dur="2.46">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re not word</text>
  <text start="809.449" dur="4.711">because they know what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="810.68" dur="5.01">do when the crisis hits they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="814.16" dur="3.45">go inside and take the people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="815.69" dur="3.959">with what the beylin documents we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="5.49">already seeing it in Austria we&amp;#39;re see</text>
  <text start="819.649" dur="5.911">it we saw in Italy we saw it in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="823.1" dur="6.089">we know grease is on the verge of that</text>
  <text start="825.56" dur="4.92">and we&amp;#39;re going to see this throughout</text>
  <text start="829.189" dur="5.101">Europe UK</text>
  <text start="830.48" dur="5.52">Canada and many other places so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="834.29" dur="4.71">think they&amp;#39;re that worried because they</text>
  <text start="836" dur="5.76">have a plan and that&amp;#39;s the take my</text>
  <text start="839" dur="4.5">currency you&amp;#39;re a currency your cousin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="3.72">currency your brother&amp;#39;s currency and</text>
  <text start="843.5" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s why I continually tell people</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="4.799">only keep as much as you need in there</text>
  <text start="847.639" dur="5.341">to pay bills otherwise place it some</text>
  <text start="850.279" dur="4.441">other place I have a lot in gold and</text>

  <text start="854.72" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t tell people where it is but I only</text>
  <text start="856.97" dur="6.479">keep enough in the bank to pay my bills</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="6.27">that is it but we see something very</text>
  <text start="863.449" dur="6.871">interesting happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="866.57" dur="5.22">the elite they&amp;#39;re getting very worried</text>
  <text start="870.32" dur="3.36">about what is going on here and we</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="5.729">talked about how they were building</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="5.339">these homes away from civilization like</text>
  <text start="877.519" dur="5.19">in New Zealand with their private</text>
  <text start="879.019" dur="6.87">runways but we&amp;#39;re also seeing that</text>

  <text start="885.889" dur="10.14">survival bunkers to escape civil unrest</text>
  <text start="889.88" dur="7.53">and a collapse of the system and what</text>
  <text start="896.029" dur="5.971">we&amp;#39;re seeing is there a company called</text>
