  <text start="362.99" dur="8.8">people are nervous people are afraid of</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="6.22">what is happening right now because none</text>
  <text start="371.79" dur="3.63">of these statistical numbers that the</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="5.37">government is throwing at us it makes no</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="6.72">sense when you&amp;#39;re sitting there and you</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="9.21">see stores closing down your neighbors</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="10.46">losing jobs strip malls being emptied no</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="8.01">one shopping in malls there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="5.92">when you see manufacturing declining and</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="5.34">people being laid off there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="3.96">now the US government the central</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="4.76">bankers are trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="402.48" dur="6.48">that manufacturing is on a rebound and</text>
  <text start="405.95" dur="5.14">there&amp;#39;s trying to say see look all of a</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="5.01">sudden everything is getting better the</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="11.76">economy is doing well and when you look</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="12.8">at this how can this be suddenly the</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="6.36">manufacturing indices catapulted higher</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="4.79">supposedly because manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="5.77">rebounding well</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="7.26">now when we really look at this we see</text>
  <text start="434.98" dur="7.95">that us strong domestic activity can</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="6.81">only stimulate manufacturing but with 45</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="4.32">million people on food stamps and more</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="4.74">than 50 million who are permanently</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="6.78">unemployed where is the buying power to</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="5.31">boost manufacturing a supposed rebound</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="5.88">in the US manufacturing defies</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="6.18">rationality the US dollar is still</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="3.87">perched on an ultra absurd exchange rate</text>
  <text start="461.86" dur="5.46">versus nearly every other currency in</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="8.07">the world making US exports very</text>
  <text start="467.32" dur="6">expensive and simultaneously we&amp;#39;re told</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="3.12">that the bankers have succeeded in</text>
  <text start="473.32" dur="4.409">setting the whole global economy into a</text>
  <text start="474.97" dur="4.47">recession and right now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="477.729" dur="8.521">demand there&amp;#39;s no strength there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.44" dur="8.1">nothing this is a phantom rebound now of</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="4.59">course they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="487.54" dur="6.75">that there&amp;#39;s 11 million new jobs created</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="6.24">since the start of this recovery but</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="4.62">when we look at the real world the</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="5.28">percentage of Americans with jobs hovers</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="6.18">around 40 year lows hmm this translates</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="6.75">into 3 million less Americans with jobs</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="8.31">since the start of the recovery the 11</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="8.13">million new jobs never existed just like</text>
  <text start="513.4" dur="6.78">this manufacturing rebound the whole</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="6.54">thing is made up by the US government</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="9.54">central bankers how do they make it up</text>
  <text start="523.78" dur="9.95">they manipulate massage drop off forget</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="7.85">to add up different numbers and</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="6.76">statistics are very easy to play with</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s why they continually say oh these</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="5.28">people dropped off they don&amp;#39;t want a job</text>
  <text start="542.94" dur="5.5">don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re creating all of these</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="4.86">part-time jobs and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="4.2">part-time jobs we&amp;#39;re not even sure that</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re really created because as we can</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.08">see more and more retailers are laying</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="4.17">off and closing down but they keep</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="6.71">telling us that manufacturing is picking</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="6.54">up but we see no demand by the consumer</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="5.5">so again</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="6.42">someone&amp;#39;s lying and guess what it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="4.47">central banks and the US government we</text>
  <text start="571.69" dur="4.11">see the Baltic Dry Index it climbed</text>
  <text start="573.4" dur="3.9">another three points after dropping a</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="5.4">couple of points and we&amp;#39;re hovering</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="5.73">around this 395 area at this point I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="581.2" dur="4.05">going to say we&amp;#39;re going to start to see</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="5.1">this bounce up and down now around this</text>
  <text start="585.25" dur="4.62">area down to 380 back up to 390 and</text>
  <text start="588.13" dur="5.48">again this is what they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="589.87" dur="6.42">to say this is the new normal now this</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="6.28">part right here everyone should be</text>
