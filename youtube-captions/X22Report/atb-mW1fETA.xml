  <text start="40.039" dur="4.261">catastrophe executive order and the</text>
  <text start="42.409" dur="4.261">reason for this title is that i&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="44.3" dur="6.059">many reports today stating that</text>
  <text start="46.67" dur="6.54">President Obama is going to bring us to</text>
  <text start="50.359" dur="6.47">the edge of default and if he does</text>
  <text start="53.21" dur="7.769">default he can declare a national</text>
  <text start="56.829" dur="8.23">emergency and implement the executive</text>

  <text start="71.96" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re going to go out the Spain right</text>
  <text start="73.73" dur="5.48">now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing out in Spain</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="7.02">is that the austerity austerity program</text>
  <text start="79.21" dur="6.85">is really having a huge impact on the</text>
  <text start="82.97" dur="6.09">children the cuts are leaving children</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="4.98">in child poverty their malnutrition they</text>

  <text start="91.04" dur="6.33">inadequate housing for these children</text>
  <text start="93.32" dur="7.67">and we can see these countries are not</text>
  <text start="97.37" dur="6.24">in any type of recovery I know in the</text>
  <text start="100.99" dur="3.94">eurozone and in these countries the</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="4.5">government officials are out there</text>
  <text start="104.93" dur="5.729">telling us that they are in recovery and</text>
  <text start="108.11" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re doing a lot better but we see</text>

  <text start="124.52" dur="4.23">these countries are implementing are</text>
  <text start="126.83" dur="4.68">having an effect I mean there are cuts</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="5.64">in social and health and educational</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="7.589">budgets have led to a worrying growth of</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="6.32">family poverty in Spain and we can see</text>
  <text start="139.099" dur="6.051">not just in</text>
  <text start="140.71" dur="7.68">pain but in many countries in Europe</text>

  <text start="215.44" dur="4.5">eurozone country in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="7.17">and it has been bailed out by the rest</text>

  <text start="238.3" dur="5.52">percent the European nations are in</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="5.58">shambles I mean if we look at Cypress we</text>
  <text start="243.82" dur="5.94">look at Greece they have higher</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="5.04">unemployment rates than most of these</text>
  <text start="249.76" dur="4.35">other countries they have been bailed</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="5.07">out many times Cyprus as we know has</text>
  <text start="254.11" dur="5.76">done balance and bailouts and we are</text>
  <text start="257.17" dur="6.09">seeing that things are not getting</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="6.11">better in the eurozone in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="6.84">has close to 20 million people</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="7.989">unemployed right now and these people</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="6.629">require food housing metal medical care</text>
  <text start="273.969" dur="5.04">and they are just not getting what they</text>
  <text start="276.729" dur="6.42">need because the government&amp;#39;s are pretty</text>
  <text start="279.009" dur="6.66">much broke just like in the US and they</text>
  <text start="283.149" dur="3.72">can pretend that everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="3.99">if you notice I just want to bring up</text>
  <text start="286.869" dur="4.35">this one point if you notice in the US</text>
  <text start="289.659" dur="3.77">government we&amp;#39;re talking about this</text>
  <text start="291.219" dur="4.2">whole debt ceiling they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="293.429" dur="4.181">Obamacare defunding it they are talking</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="5.49">about everything except what the real</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="6.529">problem is and we&amp;#39;ve seen this 14 times</text>
  <text start="300.909" dur="6.42">before we reach the debt ceiling and the</text>
  <text start="304.139" dur="6.31">whole argument is should we raise the</text>
  <text start="307.329" dur="6.781">debt ceiling this problem is going to</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="7.35">come back again it doesn&amp;#39;t go away it is</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="6.059">like having a family who has 20 credit</text>
  <text start="317.799" dur="5.34">cards they&amp;#39;re all filled up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="5.941">maxed out and they need to get another</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="5.67">one so they can survive the problem does</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="6.329">not go away what happens is you</text>
  <text start="328.809" dur="7.53">continually ask for more until they</text>
  <text start="332.439" dur="5.82">there isn&amp;#39;t you there&amp;#39;s no longer you</text>
  <text start="336.339" dur="4.95">can no longer receive anymore because</text>
  <text start="338.259" dur="6.71">you cannot handle the interest payments</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="6.27">on this debt and we are seeing this now</text>
  <text start="344.969" dur="5.98">with the government they are not talking</text>
  <text start="347.559" dur="6.93">about the huge elephant in the room is</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="7.23">that we have a problem a debt problem</text>
  <text start="354.489" dur="7.23">and it&amp;#39;s not going to be solved by just</text>
  <text start="358.179" dur="6.51">raising the debt ceiling that actually</text>
  <text start="361.719" dur="7.47">is going to make it worse and they know</text>
  <text start="364.689" dur="6.87">this now we do understand that the</text>
  <text start="369.189" dur="4.65">collapse is coming and we understand</text>
  <text start="371.559" dur="5.25">that they are smacking down gold and we</text>
  <text start="373.839" dur="4.95">saw today when below 1,300 now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="376.809" dur="5.16">little bit above 1,300 but it is down</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="6.15">today and we have yesterday reported</text>
  <text start="381.969" dur="5.7">that Goldman Sachs is telling people</text>
  <text start="384.939" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s a perfect time to sell and you know</text>
  <text start="387.669" dur="4.11">just like they did back in April they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.739" dur="4.59">going to gobble up as much gold to say</text>
  <text start="391.779" dur="4.98">not as they can because they realize the</text>
  <text start="394.329" dur="4.98">economy is collapsing and they realize</text>
  <text start="396.759" dur="6.24">they need real money and what is real</text>
  <text start="399.309" dur="8.22">money gold and silver platinum palladium</text>
  <text start="402.999" dur="5.071">any any of the precious metals JPMorgan</text>
  <text start="407.529" dur="2.341">is having a</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="3.9">problem because everyone wants physical</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="4.26">delivery of the gold and they realized</text>
  <text start="411.97" dur="4.71">that they are pretty much screwed so</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="3.81">instead of facing up to this what</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="4.98">sell their physical commodity commodity</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="6.63">business and hand it off to someone else</text>
  <text start="422.92" dur="6.81">and they&amp;#39;re looking you know for you</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="4.74">know like 3.3 billion dollars for their</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="3.24">commodity business and they just want to</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="3.21">get out of the business right now before</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="3.21">the whole thing collapses and everyone</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="5.64">comes for the gold and they do not have</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="8.54">enough to give out now the US Treasury</text>
  <text start="440.17" dur="9.06">is out there and it is saying that this</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="6.64">shutdown this debt ceiling debacle that</text>
  <text start="449.23" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re doing that they&amp;#39;re having right</text>
  <text start="451.36" dur="6.3">now is going to have a permanent damage</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="5.91">on the reputation of the United States</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="6.66">and it could be a problem with other</text>
  <text start="460.42" dur="7.74">countries buying our bonds and feeling</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="5.37">that they are secure and you know what</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re leading up to</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="6.24">why the economy is declining why other</text>
  <text start="473.23" dur="6.51">nations are selling their bonds why the</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="7.2">fed is one of the major purchases</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="6.27">purchasers of these bonds and they are</text>
  <text start="483.13" dur="8.28">building the case to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="486.01" dur="8.55">that the longer that this shutdown goes</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="6.39">on the economy gets worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="7.35">nations will not want to hold on to</text>
  <text start="497.8" dur="7.95">their bonds and what we can see right</text>
  <text start="501.91" dur="5.73">now is fidelity sells all debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="4.92">maturing Treasuries despite blogosphere</text>
  <text start="507.64" dur="6.839">all clear call they are selling all of</text>
  <text start="510.67" dur="6.45">their Treasury bonds and they are</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="5.431">getting rid of them as fast as they</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="6.75">possibly can and we see that other</text>
  <text start="519.91" dur="7.05">foreign nations are also dumping these</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="5.73">Treasury bonds and the Fed will need to</text>
  <text start="526.96" dur="4.89">pick this up and purchase them because</text>
  <text start="529.6" dur="7.92">if there&amp;#39;s a cellar there needs to be a</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="9.21">buyer and American author James Bovard</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="4.41">says a time will soon come when the</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="2.969">United States</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="5.94">can no longer sell its ever expanding</text>
  <text start="544.029" dur="6.421">that to foreigners and this time is</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="4.98">approaching very quickly because</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="5.4">everyone is looking at the debt and what</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re showing us is 17 trillion but if</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="4.98">we count in everything the debt is</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="7.62">really like 200 trillion dollars and</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="7.83">this is impossible at this point to pay</text>
  <text start="565.42" dur="5.669">off the tax revenue that the government</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="5.58">brings in from all the unemployed and</text>
  <text start="571.089" dur="6.81">underemployed people makes it impossible</text>
  <text start="574.24" dur="6.06">to use that money to pay off the debt</text>
  <text start="577.899" dur="5.161">yeah they can pay off the interest and</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="5.909">keep it going but it&amp;#39;s like a family</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="5.85">that has 20 credit cards and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.209" dur="5.19">just paying their minimum amount each</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="5.76">month which is only the interest you</text>
  <text start="591.399" dur="5.641">never get anywhere you just keep things</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="5.789">going but what happens is and everyone</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="6.57">who had credit cards before or still has</text>
  <text start="600.459" dur="5.701">them realizes that if you do not pay the</text>
  <text start="603.61" dur="4.979">principal down and you keep charging on</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="4.35">the card the interest payments</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="5.94">continually go up and the amount of</text>
  <text start="610.51" dur="6.96">income that you&amp;#39;re bringing in never can</text>
  <text start="614.529" dur="6.451">really solve the problem and you lose</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="8.61">the battle you cannot continually do</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="8.28">this china now is saying listen you</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="5.699">better get your act together us because</text>
  <text start="629.26" dur="5.34">you know we hold a lot of the Treasury</text>
  <text start="631.779" dur="6.151">bonds and what China is doing they just</text>
  <text start="634.6" dur="5.85">added another 131 tons of gold to their</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="5.909">stockpile because they are worried and</text>
  <text start="640.45" dur="5.73">they are using and acquiring all this</text>
  <text start="643.839" dur="5.641">gold because they understand that</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="6.57">eventually the US dollar the US economy</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="5.549">is going to collapse and the US dollar</text>

  <text start="950.7" dur="6.15">group that has to pay more what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="954.96" dur="4.32">reasoning for this same thing with</text>
  <text start="956.85" dur="5.22">health insurance you could have someone</text>
  <text start="959.28" dur="4.92">who is underemployed or unemployed and</text>
  <text start="962.07" dur="3.87">they understand there&amp;#39;s a lot of us even</text>
  <text start="964.2" dur="4.17">though they manipulate the numbers the</text>
  <text start="965.94" dur="5.49">the actual numbers of unemployment is</text>
  <text start="968.37" dur="6.27">around 23% they manipulated and change</text>
  <text start="971.43" dur="5.13">the calculation back in 1994 and they</text>
  <text start="974.64" dur="3.57">continue to do this they don&amp;#39;t count the</text>
  <text start="976.56" dur="4.22">people that dropped off not looking</text>
  <text start="978.21" dur="5.25">anymore because there&amp;#39;s just no jobs if</text>
  <text start="980.78" dur="6.16">someone is going to apply for health</text>

  <text start="986.94" dur="4.89">because of a foreclosure and we know</text>
  <text start="989.22" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s a lot of those or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="991.83" dur="5.25">underemployed or unemployed and they can</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="6.3">make the credit card payments what does</text>
  <text start="997.08" dur="6.69">this have to do with the person&amp;#39;s health</text>
  <text start="1000.35" dur="5.88">for example we could have a person that</text>
  <text start="1003.77" dur="4.5">is struggling to get by they have two or</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="4.05">three part-time jobs and they are</text>
  <text start="1008.27" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re working their ass off to make</text>
  <text start="1010.28" dur="5.67">ends meet but they have to pay now a</text>
  <text start="1012.77" dur="5.19">higher premium because they have bad</text>
  <text start="1015.95" dur="3.9">credit they don&amp;#39;t visit the doctor</text>
  <text start="1017.96" dur="6.42">because most of these people who work</text>
  <text start="1019.85" dur="9.12">hard like this very rarely get sick and</text>
  <text start="1024.38" dur="7.32">this is a proven statistic and we can</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="7.95">have another person who has perfect</text>
  <text start="1031.7" dur="7.58">credit but is in the hospital three to</text>
  <text start="1036.92" dur="6.15">four times could have some type of</text>
  <text start="1039.28" dur="7.45">ailment like diabetes heart condition</text>
  <text start="1043.07" dur="6.6">and run the medical bills up this shows</text>
  <text start="1046.73" dur="6.15">this has nothing to do with health</text>
  <text start="1049.67" dur="5.7">asking for credit score this only has to</text>
  <text start="1052.88" dur="8.45">do with the insurance companies making</text>
  <text start="1055.37" dur="10.89">more money and also when you sign up for</text>

  <text start="1388.9" dur="4.95">Assad as the individual and I believe</text>
  <text start="1392.14" dur="4.89">this is what they&amp;#39;re going to use as</text>
  <text start="1393.85" dur="5.64">wiggle room to get Assad and a couple</text>

  <text start="1485.98" dur="5.669">mortar bombs fired from Syria hit in an</text>
  <text start="1489.039" dur="5.311">Israeli military post on the occupied</text>
  <text start="1491.649" dur="6.39">golan heights and it wounded some</text>
  <text start="1494.35" dur="6">Israeli soldiers and Israel fired back</text>
  <text start="1498.039" dur="5.191">they were hoping that Syria would fire</text>
  <text start="1500.35" dur="5.279">back again but nothing happened this was</text>
  <text start="1503.23" dur="5.99">probably a false flag to try to get</text>
  <text start="1505.629" dur="5.67">something started and it didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="1509.22" dur="4.659">what they&amp;#39;re saying is the initial</text>
  <text start="1511.299" dur="5.13">reports is that some mortars you know</text>
  <text start="1513.879" dur="5.52">straight away during the fighting in</text>
  <text start="1516.429" dur="4.83">Syria and we can see that something was</text>
  <text start="1519.399" dur="7.02">definitely trying to get started out</text>
  <text start="1521.259" dur="7.62">there now the government officials top</text>
  <text start="1526.419" dur="6.781">officials believe we are now sitting</text>
  <text start="1528.879" dur="6.93">ducks on a cyber pond and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1533.2" dur="4.949">saying is is that because of the</text>
  <text start="1535.809" dur="5.69">government shutdown and it&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1538.149" dur="7.921">longer and longer now we are completely</text>
  <text start="1541.499" dur="9.04">jeopardizing our cybersecurity and this</text>
  <text start="1546.07" dur="7.89">is they press a perfect storm that will</text>
  <text start="1550.539" dur="8.76">enable another country to cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1553.96" dur="9.149">the United States they are saying we are</text>
  <text start="1559.299" dur="6.75">lacking the people to hold the national</text>
  <text start="1563.109" dur="6.78">security in place and it is impossible</text>
  <text start="1566.049" dur="6.901">at this point to stop these types of</text>
  <text start="1569.889" dur="6.51">cyber attacks and if you thought that</text>
  <text start="1572.95" dur="6.679">the cyber threat was bad before in many</text>
  <text start="1576.399" dur="5.52">ways it is now a cyber attack on</text>
  <text start="1579.629" dur="5.23">steroids because we do not have the</text>
  <text start="1581.919" dur="7.58">resources to fight what is coming and</text>
  <text start="1584.859" dur="10.53">it&amp;#39;s leaving the US wide open right now</text>
  <text start="1589.499" dur="9.76">now in Arkansas we saw that the power</text>
  <text start="1595.389" dur="7.201">grid was sabotaged 10,000 people went</text>
  <text start="1599.259" dur="7.441">without power and there was a blackout</text>
  <text start="1602.59" dur="5.11">on Sunday the FBI said this is a third</text>
  <text start="1606.7" dur="3.579">at</text>
  <text start="1607.7" dur="5.01">in recent weeks and they brought down</text>
  <text start="1610.279" dur="6.211">some power lines and they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="1612.71" dur="7.29">what to do to create this a power</text>
  <text start="1616.49" dur="6.659">blackout and there was a message saying</text>
  <text start="1620" dur="5.94">you should have expected us and what</text>
  <text start="1623.149" dur="5.16">this leads me to believe is this is</text>
  <text start="1625.94" dur="5.07">going to be leading up to the major</text>
  <text start="1628.309" dur="5.431">attack on the power grid now the power</text>
  <text start="1631.01" dur="6.36">grid could be attacked by a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1633.74" dur="5.85">or a physical attack this was a physical</text>
  <text start="1637.37" dur="4.26">attack on the power grid and they were</text>
  <text start="1639.59" dur="5.189">able to bring down the grid and leave</text>
  <text start="1641.63" dur="5.34">10,000 people without power and we do</text>
  <text start="1644.779" dur="6.9">understand there is a power grid drill</text>
  <text start="1646.97" dur="6.179">coming up in November and this could be</text>
  <text start="1651.679" dur="6.451">the time frame it might not happen</text>
  <text start="1653.149" dur="7.74">exactly on that day but we in looking at</text>
  <text start="1658.13" dur="6.12">the whole situation it could come</text>
  <text start="1660.889" dur="6.42">anywhere in that area could come after</text>
  <text start="1664.25" dur="4.769">it right on that day but they are</text>
  <text start="1667.309" dur="5.34">definitely getting everything prepared</text>
  <text start="1669.019" dur="6.721">for some type of power grid failure some</text>
  <text start="1672.649" dur="6.63">type of false flag event to bring all of</text>
  <text start="1675.74" dur="8.73">this together and what better way to do</text>
  <text start="1679.279" dur="7.201">this is allow the American people to get</text>
  <text start="1684.47" dur="4.77">really pissed off at the government</text>
  <text start="1686.48" dur="6.99">which will just add to what is going to</text>
  <text start="1689.24" dur="7.71">happen and it looks like Obama is trying</text>
  <text start="1693.47" dur="6.809">to provoke something he is hitting all</text>
  <text start="1696.95" dur="5.43">the hot spots of the American people it</text>
  <text start="1700.279" dur="5.4">has to do with the veterans it has to do</text>
  <text start="1702.38" dur="5.279">with our military soldiers overseas with</text>
  <text start="1705.679" dur="4.021">their death benefits it has to do with</text>
  <text start="1707.659" dur="4.291">all the monuments across the country it</text>
  <text start="1709.7" dur="5.819">has to do with the websites that they</text>
  <text start="1711.95" dur="7.68">need to check on different things and</text>
  <text start="1715.519" dur="7.311">they&amp;#39;re trying to hit the Americans</text>
  <text start="1719.63" dur="6.269">where it will make them the angriest and</text>
  <text start="1722.83" dur="5.979">the citizens are getting pissed off and</text>
  <text start="1725.899" dur="5.791">this is why they are marching on DC and</text>
  <text start="1728.809" dur="6.83">we can see this this could be brewing</text>
  <text start="1731.69" dur="7.849">into a perfect storm for a confrontation</text>
  <text start="1735.639" dur="13.711">with the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="1739.539" dur="12.811">in DC now dr. Paul Craig Roberts was out</text>
  <text start="1749.35" dur="5.669">there saying that President Obama</text>
  <text start="1752.35" dur="5.25">because of the laws they already are on</text>
  <text start="1755.019" dur="5.941">the books would have the power to</text>
  <text start="1757.6" dur="5.699">declare a national catastrophe they</text>
  <text start="1760.96" dur="4.709">simply assume the leadership of the</text>
  <text start="1763.299" dur="5.161">government this gets Congress in the</text>
  <text start="1765.669" dur="4.47">courts out of the picture and at that</text>
  <text start="1768.46" dur="3.299">point there are no limits on the power</text>
  <text start="1770.139" dur="4.441">of the president if he calls for a</text>
  <text start="1771.759" dur="5.311">national catastrophe and this is one of</text>
  <text start="1774.58" dur="6.769">the executive orders and he can use this</text>
  <text start="1777.07" dur="7.4">to say that the government is in default</text>
  <text start="1781.349" dur="7.57">we&amp;#39;ve reached that point in time an</text>
  <text start="1784.47" dur="6.49">executive order 12 656 assignment of</text>
  <text start="1788.919" dur="4.651">emergency preparedness responsibility</text>
  <text start="1790.96" dur="8.219">and the provisions of this executive</text>
  <text start="1793.57" dur="7.319">order states that whereas our national</text>
  <text start="1799.179" dur="4.771">security is dependent upon our ability</text>
  <text start="1800.889" dur="5.49">to assure continuity of continuity of</text>
  <text start="1803.95" dur="4.559">government at every level in any</text>
  <text start="1806.379" dur="4.561">national security emergency situation</text>
  <text start="1808.509" dur="5.66">that might confront the nation and what</text>
  <text start="1810.94" dur="6.78">this is saying is that if the government</text>
  <text start="1814.169" dur="6.1">cannot continue to operate he can call</text>
  <text start="1817.72" dur="5.519">for a national emergency which takes all</text>
  <text start="1820.269" dur="6.931">the power away from Congress and from</text>
  <text start="1823.239" dur="7.17">the rest of the Senate and House and</text>
  <text start="1827.2" dur="5.159">gives it all to the president and while</text>
  <text start="1830.409" dur="4.71">I was doing some research I came across</text>
  <text start="1832.359" dur="5.19">something that says Pentagon warns to</text>
  <text start="1835.119" dur="5.461">expect radical change in u.s. government</text>
  <text start="1837.549" dur="5.88">soon a high troubling urgent bulletin</text>
  <text start="1840.58" dur="4.799">issued earlier today by the Ministry of</text>
  <text start="1843.429" dur="3.45">Foreign Affairs states that it has</text>
  <text start="1845.379" dur="5.03">received information from the main</text>
  <text start="1846.879" dur="5.97">intelligence agency warning to expect a</text>
  <text start="1850.409" dur="4.931">radical change in the government of the</text>
  <text start="1852.849" dur="5.4">United States possibly within the next</text>
  <text start="1855.34" dur="5.159">fortnight which is like two weeks based</text>
  <text start="1858.249" dur="3.93">on information they have received from a</text>
  <text start="1860.499" dur="4.91">highly placed sources within the</text>
  <text start="1862.179" dur="5.551">Pentagon according to this bulletin</text>
  <text start="1865.409" dur="4.96">intelligence assets were notified by</text>
  <text start="1867.73" dur="5.61">their Pentagon counterparts this past</text>
  <text start="1870.369" dur="4.681">week that President Barack Obama is for</text>
  <text start="1873.34" dur="5.97">preparing to invoke the powers given to</text>
  <text start="1875.05" dur="8.28">him under this executive order and we</text>
  <text start="1879.31" dur="6.57">can see that if this does happen he will</text>
  <text start="1883.33" dur="5.34">have sole power and i believe it&amp;#39;s for a</text>
  <text start="1885.88" dur="5.88">certain period of time where he does not</text>
  <text start="1888.67" dur="5.82">have to consult with Congress he can up</text>
  <text start="1891.76" dur="6.9">the debt ceiling by himself he can</text>
  <text start="1894.49" dur="8.04">declare martial law he can create and do</text>
  <text start="1898.66" dur="5.94">things without the congress at you know</text>
  <text start="1902.53" dur="3.57">without going to them I mean he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1904.6" dur="4.14">doing it anyhow pretty much if you</text>
  <text start="1906.1" dur="4.71">really look at it but it will enable him</text>
  <text start="1908.74" dur="5.07">to do whatever he wants and now we have</text>
  <text start="1910.81" dur="5.97">to look at this big picture because we</text>
  <text start="1913.81" dur="6.72">understand that there is a false flag</text>
  <text start="1916.78" dur="5.97">event coming we understand that they</text>
  <text start="1920.53" dur="6.42">want to get everyone under their control</text>
  <text start="1922.75" dur="8.4">and they are losing control is this plan</text>
  <text start="1926.95" dur="6.51">set up to bring us down to right where</text>
  <text start="1931.15" dur="5.25">the default happens and let it happen</text>
  <text start="1933.46" dur="7.53">and the president enabled hit the</text>
  <text start="1936.4" dur="8.46">president will then enact the executive</text>
  <text start="1940.99" dur="6.12">order to declare an emergency and take</text>
  <text start="1944.86" dur="4.17">full control I mean if you look at the</text>
  <text start="1947.11" dur="7.19">president&amp;#39;s actions he is completely</text>
  <text start="1949.03" dur="8.19">stonewalling at every turn and the house</text>
  <text start="1954.3" dur="5.65">just wants to negotiate with the</text>
  <text start="1957.22" dur="5.25">president and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="1959.95" dur="3.93">plays out because at this point in time</text>
  <text start="1962.47" dur="4.08">and again I don&amp;#39;t have a crystal ball</text>
  <text start="1963.88" dur="4.74">but when you look at everything that all</text>
  <text start="1966.55" dur="4.44">the information that&amp;#39;s coming in we are</text>
  <text start="1968.62" dur="4.68">seeing something and a picture is being</text>
  <text start="1970.99" dur="5.76">painted of something happening because</text>
  <text start="1973.3" dur="5.55">we look at what he closed down he closed</text>
  <text start="1976.75" dur="5.1">down all the things that Americans care</text>
  <text start="1978.85" dur="4.41">about but left things like left other</text>
  <text start="1981.85" dur="3.15">things open that they could have closed</text>
  <text start="1983.26" dur="4.25">down like maybe the golf course that he</text>
  <text start="1985" dur="5.43">plays golf on or how about the</text>
  <text start="1987.51" dur="4.75">congressional gym that the Senators used</text>
  <text start="1990.43" dur="3.93">why did they closed that down well that</text>
  <text start="1992.26" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t affect the American people they</text>
  <text start="1994.36" dur="4.29">close down the things that affected the</text>
  <text start="1996.73" dur="3.87">American people the Federals are getting</text>
  <text start="1998.65" dur="5.88">pissed off the military is getting</text>
  <text start="2000.6" dur="6.57">pissed off people who are want to see</text>

  <text start="2007.17" dur="5.69">people are going into Washington to</text>
  <text start="2009.09" dur="7.26">protest this is building up to something</text>
  <text start="2012.86" dur="7.78">for having the initial protest starting</text>
  <text start="2016.35" dur="8.1">this week the trucker&amp;#39;s bikers veterans</text>
  <text start="2020.64" dur="6.54">and people are all heading towards DC we</text>
  <text start="2024.45" dur="4.62">are getting close to that October 17th</text>
  <text start="2027.18" dur="4.26">date and I understand that they pushed a</text>
  <text start="2029.07" dur="4.26">little bit further because what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2031.44" dur="4.83">done with Treasury bonds to make it go</text>
  <text start="2033.33" dur="7.02">further and we can see that something is</text>
