  <text start="56.44" dur="5.61">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.449" dur="6.481">episode 1371 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.05" dur="5.19">September 5th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.93" dur="5.07">episode is bricks prepare for the death</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="4.89">of $1.00 by widening membership let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70" dur="4.86">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.13" dur="5.45">news now we know that the UK they are</text>
  <text start="74.86" dur="6.33">involved in the brexit with the EU and</text>
  <text start="77.58" dur="5.98">so far nothing has been really happening</text>
  <text start="81.19" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;ve been you know extreme exchanging</text>
  <text start="83.56" dur="5.52">insults back and forth and we received</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="3.51">this leaked document it was leaked by</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="4.61">the Guardian and prepared by the Home</text>
  <text start="90.61" dur="6.24">Office and the UK has prepared a</text>
  <text start="93.69" dur="5.469">hard-line brexit plan according to which</text>
  <text start="96.85" dur="5.82">Britain will end the free movement of</text>
  <text start="99.159" dur="5.55">labour immediately after the brexit and</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="5.43">introduced resections restrictions to</text>
  <text start="104.709" dur="7.2">deter all but highly-skilled EU workers</text>
  <text start="108.1" dur="7.17">now the proposal seeks to drive down the</text>
  <text start="111.909" dur="5.91">number of lower skilled EU migrants as</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="4.5">well as a phased in introduction to a</text>
  <text start="117.819" dur="4.25">new immigration system ending the right</text>
  <text start="119.77" dur="6.12">to settle in Britain for most European</text>
  <text start="122.069" dur="6.881">immigrants now the plan is to restrict</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="6.42">EU immigration by giving preference in</text>
  <text start="128.95" dur="6.42">the job market to the resident workers</text>
  <text start="132.31" dur="5.25">not the immigrants that are coming in</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="4.89">and there are many other things that</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="4.92">been leaked in this document and we can</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="4.77">see right now they&amp;#39;re breaking away from</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="4.53">what the EU has been doing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="4.59">seeing that a lot of countries would</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="5.16">like to break away from what the the EU</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="4.53">is dictating and we might see other</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="4.739">countries once this goes through if it</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="5.58">does go through actually follow suit and</text>
  <text start="156.909" dur="5.671">we can see right now countries have been</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="4.979">you know erecting fences protecting</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="4.86">their borders because they realise that</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="5.191">they can&amp;#39;t handle the immigration all</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="4.92">these migrants coming in now the reason</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="4.169">why we&amp;#39;re seeing this flow of migrants</text>
  <text start="172.36" dur="3.42">is because of what has been happening in</text>
  <text start="174.069" dur="5.041">the Middle East and this has been caused</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="5.19">by the Cabal where we&amp;#39;re having war and</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.23">everything else in these areas and these</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="4.29">people are fleeing the area if we</text>
  <text start="183.34" dur="3.51">stopped what was going on in the Middle</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="4.41">East all these people would be</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="5.43">able to return and we wouldn&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="4.59">problem and this is why we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="3.81">the countries talking about this and</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="6.39">this is why this is part of the brexit</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="6.6">plan we see that there might be a leg up</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="5.25">for gold and it might be here right now</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="7.08">now gold has broken out of the mother of</text>
  <text start="205.9" dur="7.08">all triangle patterns and we can see</text>
  <text start="209.77" dur="5.46">that it looks like it might be at the</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="4.05">point in time where all of a sudden gold</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="3.75">starts to shoot up now how do we know</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="4.28">this well we&amp;#39;re getting confirmation of</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.4">this from the gold miners to gold ratio</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="5.2">think of this as a measure of gold beta</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="4.77">as gold miners typically leave the</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="6.39">precious metals during major moves now</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="6.12">with this in mind consider that the gold</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.11">miners to gold ratio has broken out of</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="5.13">the bullish falling wedge pattern</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="6.27">running back to 2007 this is this is</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.92">massively bullish and predicts the ratio</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="4.71">moving to a point four five</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="5.07">put another way gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="4.56">moving sharply higher and gold miners</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="4.56">are going to be going through the roof</text>
  <text start="252.55" dur="3.9">and we need to watch this very carefully</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.32">because we could see that this might</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="5.16">happen now on the flip side we know that</text>
  <text start="259.27" dur="6.42">the precious metals market is completely</text>
  <text start="261.61" dur="6.03">manipulated if we see a move in gold we</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="4.23">know what the central banks are going to</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="4.53">do we know that they&amp;#39;re gonna dump a</text>
  <text start="269.92" dur="4.38">huge amount of paper contracts and</text>
  <text start="272.17" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re not going to let gold move up</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="3.9">and this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="4.23">watch we see that Lego well it looks</text>
  <text start="278.2" dur="3">like they&amp;#39;re cutting around fourteen to</text>
  <text start="279.91" dur="3.3">fifteen hundred people that&amp;#39;s eight</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="5.82">percent of their staff and we can see</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="6.69">that the sales of Legos well that has</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="5.31">been falling and it looks like business</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.91">is not going well and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="5.37">in a lot of different companies where</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="5.52">sales are falling but the corporate</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="5.49">media the central bank&amp;#39;s the financial</text>
  <text start="301.33" dur="3.57">pundits they don&amp;#39;t want to admit this</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t want to admit that there are</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="3.96">major problems in the economy because</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="4.05">think about this for a second we know</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="4.53">the unemployment rate is not in the 4%</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="4.08">range we know it&amp;#39;s much much higher</text>
  <text start="313.39" dur="4.2">we know that it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="4.22">and from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="5.63">looking at we can see that</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="8.52">this holds true because if unemployment</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="6.87">was really around 4.7 percent or 4.8% or</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="3.96">whatever they&amp;#39;re saying it is we</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="3.93">wouldn&amp;#39;t see retail closing like this</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;d be seeing retail expand because</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment so one</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="4.23">or two things are happening here one</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="4.92">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs and this number</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="4.02">is completely manipulated or people have</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="3.72">a lot of part-time jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345" dur="4.59">making a lot less money where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.8">spend and this is why the unemployment</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="4.86">numbers are so low now both of these</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="4.5">things are happening people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="354.45" dur="4.26">jobs people have taken part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="5.61">may be more than one and they&amp;#39;re counted</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.82">more than more than one time which</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="5.88">allows the unemployment numbers to look</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="5.28">really really great but in reality we</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="4.11">can see from what the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="4.83">from retail from the housing market from</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="5.52">the automobile market we can see that</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="4.98">guess what the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="3.99">this is why they had a sink very low to</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="4.02">get those subprime people in because</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="3.33">most of the people are not making enough</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="4.17">money a lot of people have bad credit</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="4.56">from the last crisis and we can see that</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="3.69">retail well there&amp;#39;s nothing you can</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="4.86">really do about it once the credit cards</text>
  <text start="391.5" dur="4.62">are up to their limit and people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="3.63">ringing in enough money they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="3.81">gonna go spend in retail and this is</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="3.99">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening because right</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="5.22">now we&amp;#39;re seeing that July factory</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="6.24">orders they&amp;#39;ve plunged to the weakest</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="6.03">since February and the last time they</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="3.87">shot up it was because Boeing well they</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="5.1">had a lot of sales</text>
  <text start="412.23" dur="8.01">now factory orders have tumbled by 6.8</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="5.88">percent and this is in durable goods</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="4.89">this is washers dryers the big-ticket</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="5.64">items so it looks like things are not</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="5.64">improving now it gets a little bit worse</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="4.79">because the aggregate factory orders are</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.23">now back at their lowest level since</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="5.13">February so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.94">things are not going well in the economy</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="5.55">the economy is losing a lot of steam and</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re going into the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.99">we&amp;#39;ve known from past holiday seasons</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="4.83">they weren&amp;#39;t that great this holiday</text>
  <text start="448.26" dur="4.62">season is going to be much much worse we</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="2.359">see the NAFTA negotiations there</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="2.859">continue</text>
  <text start="453.409" dur="7.31">on and we can see that at this point</text>
  <text start="455.739" dur="7.811">there is no consensus on anything the</text>
  <text start="460.719" dur="4.84">negotiations are going nowhere and it</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="4.049">looks like the United States might</text>
  <text start="465.559" dur="4.53">terminate all of this I know Trump has</text>
  <text start="467.599" dur="4.951">been saying this over and over but right</text>
  <text start="470.089" dur="5.43">now there&amp;#39;s been no agreements nothing</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="5.579">has been settled on and this whole NAFTA</text>
  <text start="475.519" dur="7.08">treaty is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="478.129" dur="8.01">for the people of the United States now</text>
  <text start="482.599" dur="5.19">we know that the dollar is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="486.139" dur="4.23">we know that countries right now are</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="6.12">bypassing the dollar and we know already</text>
  <text start="490.369" dur="9.27">that China is looking to have a yuyuan</text>
  <text start="493.909" dur="7.92">backed crude oil futures contract and we</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="5.19">see that the BRIC nations right now with</text>
  <text start="501.829" dur="5.281">Putin and you Jinping they are looking</text>
  <text start="504.829" dur="4.34">to widen the membership they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="4.889">more and more countries into the fold</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="5.951">this is to help support the belt and</text>
  <text start="511.999" dur="4.71">road trade system and it looks like what</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re extending this</text>
  <text start="516.709" dur="3.96">to many many countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="4.26">bringing them on board because they</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="4.891">understand once the system starts to</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="5.25">break down once everything starts to</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="5.25">fall apart the dollar loses its value</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="3.66">and countries say you know something we</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t want to hold on to this we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="5.28">trust it anymore they know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.04" dur="4.469">going to need another system in place</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="3.87">and this is why over the many many years</text>
  <text start="539.509" dur="2.851">they&amp;#39;ve been planning on this this is</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="2.819">not something that happened overnight</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="3.719">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="544.189" dur="4.32">studying it and we&amp;#39;ve been realizing</text>
  <text start="546.079" dur="5.851">that slowly but surely they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="548.509" dur="6.991">creating this new system now the BRICS</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="7.68">are considering a high-speed Eurasian</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="6.72">railway to support the one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="7.8">so they can have this entire trading</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="8.489">system now China&amp;#39;s belt and Road trading</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="5.64">system well this is going to extend this</text>
  <text start="570.709" dur="4.951">high-speed rail and modern highway</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="5.31">networks in its own country as well as</text>
  <text start="575.66" dur="6">the neighboring countries and going</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="5.039">through most likely Europe and they</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="3.69">would like to bring this to all the</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="3.391">different countries and we can see that</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="1.95">there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries that are</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="2.91">jumping on</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="6.12">bored with this because they realize</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re going to need to trade once the</text>
  <text start="593.42" dur="3.51">dollar disappears and we know that</text>
  <text start="595.25" dur="3.029">manufacturing really doesn&amp;#39;t exist here</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="2.61">in the United States we have a little</text>
  <text start="598.279" dur="3.891">bit of manufacturing but most of the</text>
  <text start="599.54" dur="5.16">manufacturing is in China right now and</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="4.96">they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to produce a lot</text>
  <text start="604.7" dur="3.75">for these countries and we can see that</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="4.199">the United States is going to be left</text>
  <text start="608.45" dur="5.34">out in the cold and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="611.329" dur="4.861">is happening right now so what is</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="4.62">happening is that the dollar is sign</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="6.81">other countries are making preparations</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="7.23">to basically take over where the dollar</text>
  <text start="623" dur="5.25">left off and the dollar will just fizzle</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="5.43">away and the other countries will start</text>
  <text start="628.25" dur="5.01">building more rails will start building</text>
  <text start="631.07" dur="3.69">more roads they will start having trade</text>
  <text start="633.26" dur="5.67">with each other they&amp;#39;ll be doing it</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="7.29">outside of the dollar and the oil will</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="5.19">be sold not using the dollar and all of</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="4.59">this means that countries once again</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="3.12">they do not have to use the dollar</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="3.42">anymore</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="6.15">there will be no reason for them to even</text>
  <text start="650.06" dur="4.83">keep the dollar on hand now when this</text>
  <text start="653.39" dur="3.18">starts to happen and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="654.89" dur="4.8">getting very very close to this because</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="6.45">it looks like China and Russia they are</text>
  <text start="659.69" dur="6.089">very close to basically breaking off</text>
  <text start="663.02" dur="4.14">from the United States that they really</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="3.451">don&amp;#39;t need the United States right now</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="4.08">they can be separate and apart because</text>
  <text start="669.23" dur="3.75">most of their systems are independent</text>
  <text start="671.24" dur="4.11">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been planning</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="4.109">on for a very long time so we can see</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="3.54">that the BRICS they&amp;#39;re widening their</text>
  <text start="677.089" dur="4.411">membership they&amp;#39;re taking control</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re building up the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re building these systems where</text>

  <text start="687.74" dur="5.51">doing absolutely nothing we&amp;#39;re stuck in</text>
  <text start="690.32" dur="5.55">a huge amount of debt we&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="4.899">arguing with each other the Democrats</text>
  <text start="695.87" dur="4.62">the Republicans were stuck in the</text>

  <text start="700.49" dur="6.18">completely dying right now the dollar is</text>
  <text start="703.55" dur="4.83">dying right now and everyone&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="3.599">wake up and they&amp;#39;re gonna realize that</text>
  <text start="708.38" dur="4.11">this whole thing just fell apart and</text>
  <text start="710.269" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s going to fall apart very very</text>
  <text start="712.49" dur="6.06">quickly and when it does people are</text>
  <text start="715.07" dur="5.8">going to be shocked and we can see we</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="4.39">are definitely heading in this direction</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="4.62">it took all this time since the last</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="4.26">crisis for all these countries to</text>
  <text start="725.49" dur="3.89">basically ramp up in what they were</text>
  <text start="727.2" dur="4.5">doing to realize what was happening and</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="4">once again I&amp;#39;m not saying that China and</text>
  <text start="731.7" dur="3.36">Russia it&amp;#39;s a good thing we know that</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="3.45">China is still part of the central</text>
  <text start="735.06" dur="4.68">banking system still part of the IMF</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="4.199">still part of all of this and all the</text>
  <text start="739.74" dur="3.33">central bankers are doing right now</text>
  <text start="741.029" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re just moving their base of</text>
  <text start="743.07" dur="4.89">operations from the United States over</text>
  <text start="745.56" dur="3.24">to China they don&amp;#39;t care what country</text>

  <text start="756.72" dur="4.83">thin air they are very patient they know</text>
  <text start="759.93" dur="3.57">that eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="761.55" dur="4.83">is they will take over the system it</text>
  <text start="763.5" dur="5.07">might start out with being gold back but</text>
  <text start="766.38" dur="4.74">eventually over the many years they will</text>
  <text start="768.57" dur="4.44">push the idea that it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="771.12" dur="4.71">gold back anymore this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="773.01" dur="4.32">happened all throughout history and we</text>
  <text start="775.83" dur="3.75">can see that all they&amp;#39;re doing is trying</text>
