  <text start="158.84" dur="5.85">bubble pop now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="5.58">second what is happening out in the</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="6">market mortgage rates are continually</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.89">rising this pushes a lot more people out</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="3.75">of the market and if a lot more people</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="3.569">out of the market you have less traffic</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="3.93">coming to these homes if there&amp;#39;s less</text>
  <text start="176.299" dur="3.961">traffic coming to these homes you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="186.67" dur="4.8">longer and longer the house prices come</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="7.29">down and they keep falling this is what</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="7.89">happened back in 2006-2007 this is when</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="6.299">individuals didn&amp;#39;t understand what was</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.95">going on real estate sales people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.599" dur="4.051">understand what was going on because</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="4.5">they were used to bringing bus loads of</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="4.41">people to homes showing it to them and</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.41">it was sold the same exact day and then</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="4.29">all of a sudden interest rates started</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="5.129">to rise mortgage rates started to rise</text>
  <text start="215.35" dur="5.4">the traffic dried up and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.349" dur="5.581">get anyone to come to the houses and all</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="5.87">you saw was prices continually dropping</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="5.369">and everyone started to chase the market</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="4.72">because every time you lowered it the</text>
  <text start="229.299" dur="5.041">market lowered the price even further</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.429">and it kept happening in many many</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="4.26">different areas we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="236.769" dur="5.491">thing happened once again now the</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="5.969">bubbles that were created after 2008</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re all going to start to pop just</text>
  <text start="244.569" dur="5.241">like Canada Canada has one of the</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="5.701">biggest housing bubbles we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.72">it&amp;#39;s bigger than the US and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="3.96">starting to see it&amp;#39;s completely falling</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="6.509">apart commercial real estate prices they</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="6.9">peaked in August 2017 at 27 percent</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="4.951">above the crazy peak of the prior bubble</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="5.46">now according to the Green Street</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="6.81">commercial property index the sea PPI we</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="7.17">can see that prices now they&amp;#39;re falling</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="6.15">and by April this year the index was</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="6.33">down 1.4 percent from the peak and by</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="6.3">about 1% from April a year ago and we</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="6.75">can see from the graph that if we go</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="7.289">back in time and we look at 2007 2008</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="7.02">2009 we see the commercial property</text>
  <text start="292.539" dur="7.081">price index down by negative 10 we are</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="7.41">already at negative 2 and this is April</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="8.28">2018 and it&amp;#39;s been dropping since mid</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="7.14">2017 and we&amp;#39;re going to the same exact</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="5.43">spot we were during the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="5.339">now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of economic</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="5.31">indicators showing us that the economy</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="3.691">is completely falling apart we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="318.64" dur="3.39">bubbles pop</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.08">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that credit cards they</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="4.68">are at the highest point that we&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="324.19" dur="4.62">seen and again a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="326.71" dur="5.07">tapped out a lot of people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="5.19">have enough to you know go along on</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="4.02">their daily lives and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="334" dur="4.77">are using their credit cards to make</text>
  <text start="335.8" dur="6.21">ends meet and from the latest data data</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="6.75">from the Fed what we are seeing here is</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="6.93">that we have about 1 trillion of credit</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="6.33">card revolving loans a record 1.3</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="6.09">trillion of auto loans and a record 1.5</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="5.04">trillion of student loans now credit</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="3.9">card and auto loans have been</text>
  <text start="356.89" dur="3.51">experiencing accelerating delinquencies</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="3.21">and when we look at this we could see</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="4.17">that the big banks aren&amp;#39;t the problem</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="4.83">this time it&amp;#39;s the small banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.57" dur="5.67">seeing a huge amount of credit card</text>
  <text start="366.97" dur="6.72">charge offs and it&amp;#39;s almost at the point</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="6.18">it was during the crisis now the big</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="4.38">banks they have been pushing this off to</text>
  <text start="376.42" dur="3.87">the smaller banks so they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="4.71">to be hit as hard but we can see what is</text>
  <text start="380.29" dur="4.43">happening right now and we can see the</text>
  <text start="382.78" dur="4.92">outstanding credit card borrowings</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="5.71">unexpectedly declined by 2.6 billion the</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="5.7">most since the end of 2012 after a drop</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="5.37">of just about 500 million last month now</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="3.93">when we look at the graph and we look at</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="4.59">the revolving consumer credit and</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="4.95">monthly change we can see that we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="3.3">the point actually we&amp;#39;re at the point</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="3.87">where we&amp;#39;re much higher than we were</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="4.71">during the Great Recession we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="5.49">seeing that downturn now that we saw</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="4.8">back in 2008 we&amp;#39;re at the same exact</text>
  <text start="411.64" dur="5.01">point but we&amp;#39;re a little bit higher</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="5.96">which shows us we are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="5.82">right now we&amp;#39;ve plateaued we are now</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="5.53">declining and we&amp;#39;re declining very very</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="4.68">quickly and when we start to put all</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="5.43">this together what does this mean well</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="5.31">we understand that credit is going to</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="5.01">freeze up we talked about this in the</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="5.16">last report and if credit freezes up</text>

  <text start="437.62" dur="4.8">to 2008 I mean there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="440.23" dur="3.78">talking about credit freeze Italian that</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="3.9">credit is going to you know come to a</text>
  <text start="444.01" dur="3.69">screeching halt and everyone laughed and</text>

  <text start="457.24" dur="5.19">were laughing at came true we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="4.86">the exact same signs once again and if</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="5.13">credit freezes up like it did back in</text>

  <text start="481.81" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse because</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="4.59">what the central bankers have done is</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve created this illusionary economy</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="4.11">and you really do believe that</text>
  <text start="489.64" dur="4.62">everything is great because they pumped</text>

  <text start="536.26" dur="6.12">completely made-up it wasn&amp;#39;t based in</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="4.65">reality but everyone thought it was</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="4.68">based in reality and everyone kept</text>
  <text start="544.48" dur="5.61">investing in it even the pension funds</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="5.46">and once again we&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>

  <text start="651.889" dur="3.601">running through the United States and</text>
  <text start="653.179" dur="4.171">slowly but surely what the central</text>
  <text start="655.49" dur="3.569">bankers did over time was move</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="4.289">everything out of the United States</text>
  <text start="659.059" dur="5.731">because they knew their system was not</text>
  <text start="661.639" dur="5.971">going to last even if they backed it up</text>
  <text start="664.79" dur="5.909">using the petro dollar it was never</text>
  <text start="667.61" dur="5.459">going to last because they know when you</text>
  <text start="670.699" dur="4.771">continually create currency and you</text>
  <text start="673.069" dur="4.68">continually create currency with no</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="5.729">ceiling and it just happens and it keeps</text>
  <text start="677.749" dur="6.601">happening you run into problems go back</text>
  <text start="681.199" dur="6.421">in history it has happened every single</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="6.359">time without question and those systems</text>
  <text start="687.62" dur="5.49">always collapse and they knew it and</text>
  <text start="690.709" dur="4.44">they knew how much time they have they</text>
  <text start="693.11" dur="4.229">knew exactly what they needed to do they</text>
  <text start="695.149" dur="3.511">knew exactly where it was going to end</text>
  <text start="697.339" dur="3.451">up and this is why they made all the</text>
  <text start="698.66" dur="3.929">deals with China now during that period</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="4.019">of time people thought oh we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="702.589" dur="3.93">these deals with China to get cheaper</text>
  <text start="704.809" dur="4.231">products here to make us feel good and</text>
  <text start="706.519" dur="5.57">everything looks great yes they were</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="6.93">doing that but there was an underlying</text>
  <text start="712.089" dur="6.641">agenda the underlying agenda was to move</text>
  <text start="715.97" dur="3.06">everything from the United States over</text>
  <text start="718.73" dur="2.61">to</text>
  <text start="719.03" dur="5.88">because they knew eventually they were</text>
  <text start="721.34" dur="4.98">gonna be the next power that is what is</text>
  <text start="724.91" dur="3.66">happening right now they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="726.32" dur="5.1">calling the shots and the United States</text>
  <text start="728.57" dur="6.18">will no longer call the shots because</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="6.45">they will hold all the cards they have</text>
  <text start="734.75" dur="3.51">70 countries on the belt and road</text>
  <text start="737.87" dur="2.64">already</text>
  <text start="738.26" dur="3.9">and eventually the United States and the</text>
  <text start="740.51" dur="3.51">rest of the countries are going to have</text>
  <text start="742.16" dur="3.63">to join I know there are countries that</text>
  <text start="744.02" dur="3.99">are fighting it they you know they did</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="3.75">the TPP that&amp;#39;s not gonna work</text>
  <text start="748.01" dur="3.45">because the United States is not</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="4.02">involved in that Trump made sure that</text>
  <text start="751.46" dur="3.84">note we&amp;#39;re not gonna be joining it so</text>
  <text start="753.56" dur="4.86">this whole thing is not by coincidence</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="7.02">it is happening and is happening very</text>
  <text start="758.42" dur="5.97">quickly think back to the 70s when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="6.09">coming off the gold standard and if I</text>
  <text start="764.39" dur="6.45">came out during the 60s and I was</text>
  <text start="768.41" dur="5.52">telling the stories of hey behind the</text>
  <text start="770.84" dur="5.82">scenes right now it looks like Kissinger</text>
  <text start="773.93" dur="5.7">and many others they are talking about a</text>
  <text start="776.66" dur="5.16">petro dollar system and what they want</text>
  <text start="779.63" dur="4.47">to do is they want to move us off the</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="4.98">gold standard that we&amp;#39;re on today move</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="5.16">us over to an oil based system where the</text>
  <text start="786.8" dur="4.71">dollar would basically be used to</text>
  <text start="789.26" dur="3.81">purchase the oil and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="791.51" dur="3">in the Middle East right now making</text>
  <text start="793.07" dur="3.21">deals with all these different countries</text>
  <text start="794.51" dur="4.8">saying listen we will protect you as</text>
  <text start="796.28" dur="5.34">long as you use the dollar on oil trade</text>
  <text start="799.31" dur="4.68">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="801.62" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to make up this incredible</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="5.55">story where they&amp;#39;re going to say that</text>
  <text start="805.88" dur="5.19">speculators were speculating in the gold</text>
  <text start="809.54" dur="2.85">market and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to come off</text>
  <text start="811.07" dur="2.61">the gold center because of that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="1.65">gonna be temporary so don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="3">it</text>
  <text start="814.04" dur="4.23">and I was telling you all this during</text>
  <text start="816.68" dur="4.23">the 60s most of the people would laugh</text>
  <text start="818.27" dur="4.23">because no one believed it come off the</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="2.94">gold standard that&amp;#39;s ridiculous we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="822.5" dur="3.72">the gold said why would we come off of</text>
  <text start="823.85" dur="3.77">it well if we do it&amp;#39;s only gonna be</text>
  <text start="826.22" dur="3.6">temporary of course it was been</text>
  <text start="827.62" dur="4.84">40-something years it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="4.44">temporary and if I told you they were</text>
  <text start="832.46" dur="3.78">going to make up a story that we had a</text>
  <text start="834.26" dur="4.05">shortage in oil that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="836.24" dur="4.05">see gas lines has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="838.31" dur="4.98">petrodollar system has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="840.29" dur="4.83">with anything else it&amp;#39;s because we have</text>
  <text start="843.29" dur="5.67">a shortage of oil and this is why you</text>
  <text start="845.12" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t get fuel on certain days and this</text>
  <text start="848.96" dur="4.29">is why we have to lower the speed limit</text>
  <text start="850.43" dur="4.65">to save fuel</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="3.24">people would laugh people would say</text>
  <text start="855.08" dur="1.89">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous that&amp;#39;s never gonna</text>
  <text start="856.49" dur="3.11">happen</text>
  <text start="856.97" dur="6.09">but guess what happened it did happen</text>
  <text start="859.6" dur="6.67">the whole system changed in a blink of</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="5.81">an eye they prepared for it for many</text>
  <text start="866.27" dur="5.7">years and then they switched it and</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="5.92">everyone believed that narrative that</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="4.74">was told to them because back then we</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="2.94">didn&amp;#39;t have the internet back then we</text>
  <text start="876.71" dur="2.97">just listened to the corporate media</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="3.75">back then we just believed what they</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="4.62">were telling us we thought they were</text>
  <text start="881.48" dur="5.76">honest and we come to find out all of</text>
  <text start="884.3" dur="4.5">that was fake phony and false the same</text>
  <text start="887.24" dur="3.84">thing is happening right now</text>
  <text start="888.8" dur="4.23">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it this</text>
  <text start="891.08" dur="3.54">is why we&amp;#39;ve been following it to let</text>
  <text start="893.03" dur="3.96">everyone know what is coming up so you</text>
  <text start="894.62" dur="4.98">can be prepared so you can be ready for</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="4.35">what is about to happen here I mean</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="4.71">think about it if we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="901.34" dur="5.37">standard the gold dropped down to $10 an</text>
  <text start="904.31" dur="6.21">ounce five dollars an ounce or did it</text>
  <text start="906.71" dur="6.75">start moving up over time because why</text>
  <text start="910.52" dur="5.46">the value of the dollar decreased</text>
  <text start="913.46" dur="7.32">because they created more dollars so</text>
  <text start="915.98" dur="8.97">gold had arise but again if we told you</text>
  <text start="920.78" dur="7.68">this before 1971 how many people would</text>
  <text start="924.95" dur="6.06">have believed not many of course they</text>
  <text start="928.46" dur="4.74">believed after 1971 because again that</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="4.5">then it happened we&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="933.2" dur="3.66">thing once again we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="3.93">everything we could see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="5.58">doing we know exactly where we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="939.44" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of when and we know</text>
  <text start="942.44" dur="4.76">it&amp;#39;s going to happen sooner or later</text>
  <text start="944.54" dur="5.25">probably much sooner than later and</text>
  <text start="947.2" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for a very long</text>
  <text start="949.79" dur="3.92">time I think they&amp;#39;re ready to do it I</text>
  <text start="951.71" dur="4.59">think they&amp;#39;re ready to throw the switch</text>
  <text start="953.71" dur="4.69">to move us to a completely different</text>
  <text start="956.3" dur="3.99">system if they have it their way if they</text>
  <text start="958.4" dur="3.72">can gain the narrative and this is what</text>
  <text start="960.29" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about whoever gains</text>
  <text start="962.12" dur="3.93">the narrative that is the winner but no</text>
  <text start="964.88" dur="2.85">matter what we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through</text>
