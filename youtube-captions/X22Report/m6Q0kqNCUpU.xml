  <text start="138.28" dur="5.31">give you sound bites of why things look</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="4.5">great up to the point when things start</text>

  <text start="144.97" dur="6.45">starting to fall apart they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="6.66">going to do this and all this time</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.399">they&amp;#39;re going to give you little nuggets</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="7.14">of why things are starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="7.84">who to blame where to look and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.3" dur="6.299">already seeing this begin now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.659" dur="6.481">seeing mortgage delinquencies well</text>
  <text start="166.599" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re starting to trend upwards for</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="4.679">the first time since the first quarter</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="5.75">of 2013 mortgage delinquencies rose</text>
  <text start="174.819" dur="5.791">quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="4.53">the jump 1/4 went from four point five</text>
  <text start="180.61" dur="4.98">two percent</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="7.089">24.80 percent this is the largest since</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="5.19">2010 now the corporate media they are</text>
  <text start="189.069" dur="5.67">out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="4.83">everyone believe that retail is doing</text>
  <text start="194.739" dur="2.761">fantastic</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="4.68">one of the headlines I saw look at</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="5.459">retail sizzle and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="5.309">people are spending like crazy look how</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="3.271">much money they spent the little</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="3.991">misleading</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="8.3">remember how retail and the information</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="8.85">that they receive how it works well when</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="6.549">retail stores close down they don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="3.15">well we have Sports Authority closed</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="3.421">down</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="5.489">we have BCBG clothes 150 stores we had</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="4.92">you know wet and wild clothes this many</text>
  <text start="227.079" dur="5.91">stores well we&amp;#39;re just gonna have to</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="6.3">subtract all those sales no they spread</text>
  <text start="232.989" dur="6.951">it out over time to give the illusion</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="9.859">that retail is still doing well and</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="7.139">remember fuel costs are included in</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="6.31">retail</text>
  <text start="247.079" dur="8.77">remember if inflation increases people</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="7.41">are spending more for the same products</text>
  <text start="255.849" dur="6.63">or for fuel and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="8.071">seeing right now we are seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="10.261">increase right now fuel prices have gone</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="7.74">up because at this point we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="6.92">to see that consumer prices they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="275.11" dur="7.679">surged at the fastest pace in five years</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="7.33">so that means inflation is increasing</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="7.291">we&amp;#39;re already above the 2% mark actually</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="6.09">inflation right now we&amp;#39;ll start moving</text>
  <text start="290.08" dur="5.49">up quicker and quicker but when we look</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.92">at the retail sales we see that retail</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="5.55">sales were pushed up by fuel costs and</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.61">by inflation think about it think about</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="5.49">all the stories that you heard shutting</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="6.03">down think about the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="4.739">in January which is one of the worst</text>
  <text start="309.64" dur="3.99">months for retail sales they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="3.661">you retail sales were incredible does</text>
  <text start="313.63" dur="5.37">that make sense</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="9">we see motor vehicles the vehicles the</text>
  <text start="319" dur="9.5">parts dealers down- 1.4% we see</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="9.96">miscellaneous store retailers down- 0.2%</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="9.45">we see clothing stores only 1% building</text>
  <text start="333.97" dur="6.09">materials 0.3% furniture and home</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="5.68">furniture in the home furnishing stores</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="6.24">zero so at this point what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="5.75">is things aren&amp;#39;t going as well as</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re saying things are deteriorating</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="4.72">but they&amp;#39;re spinning the news and making</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="2.61">you believe that things are actually</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="3.3">better than they really are</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="4.59">if we really look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="4.59">that the Consumer Price Index it is</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="6.48">driven by a 14 point 2 percent</text>
  <text start="361.99" dur="8.7">year-on-year spike in gasoline prices so</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="6.15">gasoline has gone up quite a bit now</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="8.22">when we look at industrial production</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="9.3">well that declined it tumbled whatever</text>
  <text start="378.91" dur="5.58">word you want to use it tumbled to 0.3%</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="5.72">month a month this is the biggest month</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="5.97">among drops in 2016 and year-over-year</text>
  <text start="387.6" dur="5.56">industrial production is now unchanged</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="6.26">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="393.16" dur="7.95">industrial production had one pop up in</text>
  <text start="396.72" dur="7.39">the beginning of 2017 we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="6.48">something like 17 months of negative</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.97">industrial production we are in a</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="7.56">recession because once again the hard</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="8.79">data well it outshines the soft data</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="7.14">showing what&amp;#39;s really going on here we</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="6.12">see that the GDP now model well they</text>
  <text start="422.29" dur="4.47">just revised the GDP once again first</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="4.17">they were saying we&amp;#39;re going to hit 5%</text>
  <text start="426.76" dur="6.45">then it was down to 3.5% and then down</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="7.08">to 2.7 percent now we are down to 2.2</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="5.7">percent this year I mean this quarter so</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="6.03">we can view already that things are not</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="6.21">going as well as everyone believed now</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="4.71">remember we&amp;#39;ve been watching the economy</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="446.98" dur="2.91">looking at</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="3.66">the housing market we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="5.19">manipulated the manipulating numbers</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="5.01">like GDP unemployment and the rest we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="4.68">been looking at corporate default to tax</text>
  <text start="456.73" dur="4.79">receipts and we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="5.82">is contracting right now</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="6.55">now since the Great Recession which was</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="5.88">about eight years ago almost going on</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="6.3">nine years now the Heritage Foundation</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="5.25">there are 2017 index for economic</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="4.53">freedom which is an annual global study</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="5.19">that compares countries entrepreneurial</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="6.93">environments well they rank different</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="7.38">countries on economic freedom and for</text>
  <text start="485.83" dur="7.68">the ninth time since 2008 America has</text>
  <text start="489.28" dur="7.32">lost ground according to the 2017 index</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="5.52">the u.s. ranks 17th out of a hundred</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="6.12">rated economies we&amp;#39;re not even in the</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="6.93">top ten Hong Kong is number one</text>

  <text start="508.87" dur="9.36">number eight Chile is number ten the</text>
  <text start="514.54" dur="6.78">United States is number 17 that should</text>
  <text start="518.23" dur="6.66">tell you something now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="521.32" dur="6.03">talking a very long time about how the</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="4.67">central bank they don&amp;#39;t want to take</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.41">blame for what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="4.69">because they want to restart the system</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="4.32">and this has been going on for quite a</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="4.74">while they&amp;#39;ve been pumping this up</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="6.24">remember to pump up an economy to create</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="6.57">this illusion it doesn&amp;#39;t happen over a</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="5.63">day or two it happens over many years</text>
  <text start="545.56" dur="6.51">and they pump it up</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="6.28">it&amp;#39;s like pumping up a car tire with a</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="4.62">hand pump how long does it take you to</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="5.13">pump that tire up does it happen in a</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.32">minute no it takes a while this is what</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been doing to the economy here</text>
  <text start="561.01" dur="3.66">and we&amp;#39;ve been watching the economy</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="6.42">looking at what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="8.69">creating this gigantic illusion now</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="6.33">Janet Yellen she was on Capitol Hill</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.4">talking about the economy now we have to</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="5.85">understand that US wholesale inflation</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="5.86">posted its largest monthly jump in four</text>
  <text start="581.71" dur="7.2">years so inflation is moving up it&amp;#39;s way</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="8.49">above the 2% target of the Fed and its</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="7.38">approaching 2.5% on its way to 3% and we</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="5.19">have to understand that there is clear</text>
  <text start="596.29" dur="3.96">evidence right now that the US economy</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="3.33">is rolling over we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="2.7">this now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="2.46">is hiding all this the central banker is</text>
  <text start="602.95" dur="2.94">not going to come out and say hey you</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="3.63">know something the economy&amp;#39;s rolling</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="3.75">over and we&amp;#39;re headed towards really bad</text>
  <text start="607.72" dur="3.27">time sorry for all of this they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="609.64" dur="2.67">going to do that but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="3.51">following it and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="3.99">housing retail and everything else and</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="5.04">we could see right now that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="8.13">starting to roll over Yellen was saying</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="10.92">that growth is quite disappointing the</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="7.86">economy is weaker than we thought but</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="5.79">she said the Fed policies have helped</text>
  <text start="632.29" dur="6.54">they were not a hindrance and she said</text>
  <text start="636.25" dur="6.27">something very important which I think a</text>
  <text start="638.83" dur="6.21">lot of people really didn&amp;#39;t hear when</text>
  <text start="642.52" dur="6.48">she said the economy was weak quite</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="9.17">disappointing she said but it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="649" dur="6.77">fault of the Fed now that&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="6.1">important</text>
  <text start="655.77" dur="7.42">why because we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="6.6">this for a very long time how the Fed is</text>
  <text start="663.19" dur="8.1">going to take everyone in the country</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="7.4">around the world and shift where</text>
  <text start="671.29" dur="6.36">everyone is looking to another location</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="6.25">she already is telling you she&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="677.65" dur="6.33">up the entire story the setup is right</text>
  <text start="680.56" dur="5.22">now the economy is weak it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="683.98" dur="4.74">disappointing now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="685.78" dur="5.19">second they&amp;#39;ve been telling us the</text>
  <text start="688.72" dur="5.01">economy has been getting stronger and</text>
  <text start="690.97" dur="4.53">stronger and stronger we&amp;#39;re down to four</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="5.01">point six percent or four point eight</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="5.07">percent but we&amp;#39;re in the fours they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="4.32">been telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="700.57" dur="4.95">fantastic they&amp;#39;re convincing us that</text>
  <text start="703.06" dur="4.83">retail is great housing market is</text>
  <text start="705.52" dur="4.67">fantastic the stock market&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="707.89" dur="6.56">going up but she says the economy is</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="8.61">weak and it&amp;#39;s not the feds</text>
  <text start="714.45" dur="7.98">fault this is what&amp;#39;s called the set up</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="4.62">stage changing the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="722.43" dur="3.99">story</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="6.27">think about what Mario Draghi has said</text>
  <text start="726.42" dur="7.23">if Trump puts his economic policies</text>
  <text start="729.69" dur="7.68">forward well that could be a huge</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="7.05">problem in regards to the global economy</text>
  <text start="737.37" dur="6.66">think about what Fitch said they said</text>
  <text start="740.7" dur="6.2">the same exact thing right now they are</text>
  <text start="744.03" dur="8.04">setting up the narrative of the story</text>
  <text start="746.9" dur="7.84">they just did a 180 degree turn they are</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="8.4">now telling us that the economy is</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="9.48">getting weak why what&amp;#39;s changed Trump</text>
  <text start="760.47" dur="8.67">has done nothing he has done absolutely</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="6.99">nothing to the economy as of yet as we</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="4.59">were coming out of December moving into</text>

  <text start="773.73" dur="7.62">it was that Obama was handing off a</text>
  <text start="776.85" dur="5.7">strong economy now the story is changing</text>
  <text start="781.35" dur="4.95">and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="5.76">about for a very long time because it</text>
  <text start="786.3" dur="5.67">took up a long time to build up all</text>
  <text start="788.31" dur="6.96">these bubbles they have now started the</text>
  <text start="791.97" dur="5.7">narrative the story of what is going to</text>
  <text start="795.27" dur="5.7">happen we&amp;#39;ve never heard the Fed say</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="9.36">this before where they said it was weak</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="8.49">but the Fed is not to blame for it so</text>
  <text start="807.03" dur="4.8">this tells us this is the signal letting</text>
  <text start="809.46" dur="4.56">us know that they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="811.83" dur="6.06">bring this economy down now like I said</text>
  <text start="814.02" dur="5.34">in the past this is a race to who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.89" dur="4.53">going to bring down the economy because</text>
  <text start="819.36" dur="5.91">if the central bankers bring it down</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="4.56">when they want and I believe most likely</text>
  <text start="825.27" dur="3.51">it will be in the latter part of this</text>
  <text start="826.98" dur="4.08">year because they need to allow Trump</text>
  <text start="828.78" dur="5.21">time to do whatever he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="831.06" dur="6.33">this way they can blame it on him</text>
  <text start="833.99" dur="6.04">they&amp;#39;re going to wait Trump on the other</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="5.73">hand he&amp;#39;s going to have to bring it down</text>
  <text start="840.03" dur="4.53">before that period of time and blame it</text>
  <text start="843.12" dur="3.48">on the Fed now the Fed is already</text>
  <text start="844.56" dur="3.48">protecting themselves saying that the</text>
  <text start="846.6" dur="4.14">economy is weak and</text>
  <text start="848.04" dur="6">we are not to blame so we can already</text>
  <text start="850.74" dur="6.24">say the battle has already started now</text>
  <text start="854.04" dur="6.93">looking at this we know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="856.98" dur="4.65">happen we know that the people are going</text>
  <text start="860.97" dur="3.179">to suffer</text>
  <text start="861.63" dur="5.16">remember Trump doesn&amp;#39;t run the country</text>
  <text start="864.149" dur="5.341">the elected officials they don&amp;#39;t run the</text>
  <text start="866.79" dur="4.77">country yes they can pass certain laws</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="5.76">and regulations and things like that but</text>

  <text start="894.81" dur="4.17">what is going on they&amp;#39;re controlling it</text>
  <text start="896.88" dur="4.5">they understand I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
