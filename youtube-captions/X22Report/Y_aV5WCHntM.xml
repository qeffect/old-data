  <text start="121.909" dur="4.95">financial news now we know that the</text>
  <text start="125.09" dur="4.65">mainstream media the central bank the</text>
  <text start="126.859" dur="4.411">deep state all those people that are</text>
  <text start="129.74" dur="4.71">part of the elite the establishment</text>
  <text start="131.27" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="7.2">possibly can to stop the Patriots from</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="7.71">moving forward let&amp;#39;s take for example</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="7.29">the UK we know that Boris Johnson has</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="6.059">been elected to deliver brexit on</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="6.33">October 31st and he&amp;#39;s saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.569" dur="5.911">going to be a no deal because the only</text>
  <text start="155.27" dur="6.84">deal the EU would work on is the one</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="6.46">that Theresa May has which is really not</text>
  <text start="162.11" dur="4.9">a brexit deal it</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="5.94">really the same thing that we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="6">before with the illusion that there is a</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="5.97">brexit but the EU is still in control</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="6.48">and the people turn this down over and</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="7.5">over and over now</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="7.14">many MPs those who oppose the UK from</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="6.81">leaving the EU without a deal on October</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="9.72">31st they&amp;#39;ve settled on a plan their</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="6.81">plan is to stop Boris Johnson from from</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="3.21">running down the clock they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.97" dur="3.93">reportedly planning to pass legislation</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="6.15">that would force Johnson to seek a</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="6.78">three-month delay of his brexit day now</text>
  <text start="205.71" dur="6.69">right now they&amp;#39;re voting on him they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="7.35">trying to get it passed and they want to</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="5.61">stop or delay the No Deal brexit any way</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="4.38">they possibly can so let&amp;#39;s get this</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="4.92">straight Theresa May tried to push a</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="4.29">deal and the people said no this is not</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.01">a good deal actually it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="5.37">written deal that they had with the EU</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="3.99">before in a different form to make it</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="5.01">seem like there was going to be a brexit</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="5.25">which there really wasn&amp;#39;t then Theresa</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="3.99">May decided to resign because she tried</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="5.51">to get this past multiple times it</text>
  <text start="239.07" dur="7.59">didn&amp;#39;t work the people rejected it</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="7.39">then people elected Boris Johnson to</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="8.24">push the brexit deal via a No Deal</text>
  <text start="250.08" dur="7.23">brexit individuals within government</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re going against what the people</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="7.53">want and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="8.37">possibly can to stop Boris Johnson Trump</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="6.05">and Boris Johnson have already made an</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="6.44">interim deal once the brexit is done and</text>
  <text start="270.89" dur="5.35">they will protect the UK from this</text>
  <text start="274.1" dur="5.77">catastrophic disaster that the EU</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="6.45">continually pushes out there so</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="4.86">basically those in government are going</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="5.49">against the people the will of the</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="7.47">people and they&amp;#39;re trying to delay this</text>
  <text start="288.18" dur="7.56">No Deal brexit so as you can see once</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.1">again there are certain groups and</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="4.11">individuals</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.68">that are pushing their own agenda and</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s the same thing here in the United</text>
  <text start="301.98" dur="7.86">States we have a mainstream media deep</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.95">state central bank that pushes their own</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="4.65">agenda it&amp;#39;s not a people&amp;#39;s agenda it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="5.07">their agenda where they convince the</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="5.1">people that yes this is what we should</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.47">be doing it&amp;#39;s not the people saying yes</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="3.72">this is what I want just like the</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="4.74">Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve was</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="5.4">pushed on the people the people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.19">say hey you know what we really need a</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="5.78">Federal Reserve we really need a private</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="6.45">institution where we can&amp;#39;t see the books</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="7.96">where we want them to create currency</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="8.67">and then loan it to us with interest so</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="7.65">we can never get ahead and we want the</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="6.87">central bank to maintain control over</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="5.79">all the countries and we want them to be</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.62">above the law and we want them not to</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="4.74">pay any of the taxes that the people are</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="5.25">paying this is what we want know that</text>
  <text start="360.63" dur="5.64">people have never said this this was</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="5.91">pushed on the people by non elected</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="5.28">leaders and then of course certain</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="5.1">elected leaders went with it because</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="5.82">they were bribed they were suckered into</text>
  <text start="374.07" dur="6">it they saw dollar signs and they</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.61">decided you know something why not and</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="4.01">then they realized later on this was a</text>
  <text start="382.98" dur="4.41">huge mistake</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="6.55">now since Trump and the Patriots since</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve been in control right now the</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="4.53">same central bank the same team state</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="6.54">the same mainstream media they were in</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="6.81">trouble they no longer have full control</text>
  <text start="398.67" dur="4.11">of everything they thought they did but</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="4.89">they lost it</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="7.95">Trump in the Patriots took over and this</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="7.14">is why they are forcing this narrative</text>
  <text start="410.73" dur="6.81">of a recession they know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414" dur="6">cause one using the central bank where</text>
  <text start="417.54" dur="5.27">they would raise the rates and then have</text>
  <text start="420" dur="6.12">the entire system come crashing down</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="5.26">because that was their plan they thought</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="3.93">they had control they were going to use</text>
  <text start="428.07" dur="2.8">the central bank and they were going to</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="3.11">bring down</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="5.95">since they don&amp;#39;t have that control</text>
  <text start="433.16" dur="8.07">anymore they&amp;#39;re trying to force it by</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="7.95">using the network of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="6.24">media and this is the news networks on</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="5.28">TV this is the paper networks I mean</text>
  <text start="447.47" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re all one and the same and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="3.68">continually putting out articles and</text>
  <text start="451.85" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re continually repeating this</text>
  <text start="453.73" dur="4.33">trying to brainwash the people into</text>
  <text start="456.35" dur="3.03">thinking that every session is coming</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="4.23">this is that in the New York Times a</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="6.74">recession is coming eventually here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="7.32">where you&amp;#39;ll see it first out of CNBC</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="8.79">here&amp;#39;s a list of recession signals that</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="9.36">are flashing red this next one is out of</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="6.22">USA Today growing pessimism 34% of</text>

  <text start="481.13" dur="5.13">recession in 2021</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="5.88">as you can see and there&amp;#39;s many many</text>
  <text start="486.26" dur="5.69">many more articles letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="6.12">that something bad is about to happen</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="4">trying to convince people this is where</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re headed but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="4.71">these are the same things that we saw</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="4.38">when Obama was president really there</text>
  <text start="500.66" dur="3.51">was no difference we saw the same</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="7.08">indicators we saw the same things</text>
  <text start="504.17" dur="7.74">flashing red but the difference was the</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="4.86">central bank the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="511.91" dur="4.77">back then had control and they were able</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="5.28">to keep the illusion alive by keeping</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="4.83">interest rates very low when Trump came</text>
  <text start="519.56" dur="4.11">into office this is when they started to</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="5.82">raise rates and they started to increase</text>
  <text start="523.67" dur="6.39">them in 2017 and further in 2018 and</text>
  <text start="527.33" dur="5.06">they were supposed to raise them in 2019</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.79">until Trump of the Patriots took control</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="6.58">now we need to remember it&amp;#39;s the raising</text>
  <text start="535.85" dur="6.36">of the rates that causes the domino</text>
  <text start="538.97" dur="6">effect it&amp;#39;s not the look that the the</text>
  <text start="542.21" dur="4.89">lowering of the rates that comes after</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="4.23">but the mainstream media is trying to</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="4.26">convince us that if Trump lowers the</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="4.83">rates we&amp;#39;re gonna enter into a recession</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="6.63">actually it is the complete opposite of</text>
  <text start="554.03" dur="6.06">what they&amp;#39;re saying and they know that</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="4.05">they need to continually push this</text>
  <text start="560.09" dur="4.62">narrative because once the rates are</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="5.24">lowered enough and stimulus starts</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="5.4">this entire recession narrative</text>
  <text start="567.28" dur="4.84">disappeared fades into the ether and</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do about it</text>
  <text start="572.12" dur="4.02">this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="3.78">right now this is why you see so many</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="3.96">articles and this is why they keep</text>
  <text start="577.85" dur="4.62">repeating it because they know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.44">point in time that they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="582.47" dur="3.21">do this anymore and this is coming in</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="4.5">the next couple of months</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="5.39">now Trump he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="5.25">to let everyone know that hey</text>

  <text start="696.45" dur="4.68">member they have a lot of work ahead of</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="4.8">them they&amp;#39;re preparing for a transition</text>
  <text start="701.13" dur="5.07">this is why Trump was out there saying</text>
  <text start="703.71" dur="4.34">yes eventually we might go through a</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="4.8">recession it will be a bump in the road</text>
  <text start="708.05" dur="6.04">he&amp;#39;s planning the narrative and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711" dur="5.7">projecting out there because he knows</text>
  <text start="714.09" dur="4.35">and the Patriots know once they make</text>
  <text start="716.7" dur="5.33">this transition away from the central</text>
  <text start="718.44" dur="7.26">bank yes we will go through a recession</text>
  <text start="722.03" dur="8.29">it will be tough but on the other side</text>
  <text start="725.7" dur="7.19">the economy will be booming we saw this</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="4.77">back in 1971</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="6.04">back then we were coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="735.09" dur="6.27">standard and we moved into a Fiat system</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="4.71">when President Nixon took us off the</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="4.38">gold standard and we saw inflation and</text>
  <text start="743.64" dur="4.71">during this period of time people</text>
  <text start="745.74" dur="5.49">thought this was fantastic Wow look at</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="5.46">this my wages are going up wow look at</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="5.43">this my house just went up Wow look at</text>
  <text start="753.81" dur="4.77">this it&amp;#39;s fantastic but really it was an</text>
  <text start="756.66" dur="4.14">illusion what they were doing is they</text>
  <text start="758.58" dur="6.15">were creating a lot of currency which</text>
  <text start="760.8" dur="7.77">meant your dollar was devaluing when you</text>
  <text start="764.73" dur="7.56">saw inflation in the beginning this</text>
  <text start="768.57" dur="6.54">illusion tricks people into thinking</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="4.98">that everything is fantastic and look at</text>
  <text start="775.11" dur="5.07">this now everything that I purchased</text>
  <text start="777.27" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s worth a lot more but what happens</text>
  <text start="780.18" dur="5.76">over time is that the system slowly</text>
  <text start="783.6" dur="4.67">breaks down instead of one person</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="5.22">working now you need two people working</text>
  <text start="788.27" dur="5.38">instead of paying everything in cash you</text>
  <text start="791.16" dur="5.16">need to have a gas card then you needed</text>
  <text start="793.65" dur="4.68">to have a credit card and then you</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="4.65">needed to take a loan out on a</text>
  <text start="798.33" dur="5.1">automobile instead of paying cash in the</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="5.46">beginning was three years then it was</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="5.22">four years then it was five years now</text>
  <text start="806.43" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s seven eight nine years then they</text>
  <text start="808.65" dur="5.58">turned to leasing were you actually just</text>
  <text start="811.14" dur="5.85">rented the car because the monthly</text>
  <text start="814.23" dur="5.31">payment was much lower because remember</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="5.73">inflation is driving the prices of these</text>
  <text start="819.54" dur="6.24">cars up up and up actually the value of</text>
  <text start="822.72" dur="4.92">the dollar is decreasing each time which</text>
  <text start="825.78" dur="3.66">means a lot more dollars are needed to</text>
  <text start="827.64" dur="3.47">pay for that same exact car so they</text>
  <text start="829.44" dur="6.63">moved into Li</text>
  <text start="831.11" dur="7.93">the whole thing is a trick the whole</text>
  <text start="836.07" dur="5.579">system breaks down as you move towards</text>
  <text start="839.04" dur="6.95">the end of a central bank system and</text>
  <text start="841.649" dur="6.331">here we are today huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="845.99" dur="4.12">college graduates they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="847.98" dur="5.359">difficult time finding high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="6.719">they have a huge amount of college debt</text>
  <text start="853.339" dur="5.381">people are in debt around the world they</text>
  <text start="856.829" dur="4.551">have one two three four five six credit</text>
  <text start="858.72" dur="5.13">cards hardly anything in savings and</text>
  <text start="861.38" dur="4.449">this is all because of the central bank</text>
  <text start="863.85" dur="4.89">system in the beginning it feels</text>
  <text start="865.829" dur="5.581">fantastic then they tell you stories of</text>
  <text start="868.74" dur="4.74">why you need two people working why you</text>
  <text start="871.41" dur="4.89">need a credit card why you need this and</text>
  <text start="873.48" dur="5.4">that and the other thing eventually</text>
  <text start="876.3" dur="4.229">people start to realize that this system</text>
  <text start="878.88" dur="4.5">does not work for them</text>
  <text start="880.529" dur="6.12">and as we see gold continually move up</text>
  <text start="883.38" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s an indicator to let us know that</text>
  <text start="886.649" dur="5.731">the central bank system is over and</text>
  <text start="889.29" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to see when we</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="5.97">see gold approach 2,000 2,500 3,000 and</text>
  <text start="895.95" dur="4.86">I do believe when it hits around three</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="5.25">to four thousand dollars that is the</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="5.399">solid indicator letting us know the fiat</text>
  <text start="903.6" dur="4.38">system has completely broken down and I</text>
  <text start="906.209" dur="4.351">think by maybe just a little bit before</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="5.88">that time you won&amp;#39;t even be able to find</text>
  <text start="910.56" dur="6">gold people will be rushing to own gold</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="3.93">at that point people are sitting back</text>
  <text start="916.56" dur="2.88">right now because they&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="917.79" dur="4.08">before they&amp;#39;ve been tricked before and</text>
  <text start="919.44" dur="4.709">this was a trick done by the central</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="5.55">banks to make sure that people would not</text>
  <text start="924.149" dur="4.831">go and purchase precious metals but what</text>
  <text start="927.42" dur="3.33">you should be doing and I&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="928.98" dur="5.419">in this is my opinion it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="930.75" dur="6.029">pursing purchasing gold or silver and</text>
  <text start="934.399" dur="4">you don&amp;#39;t have to buy a whole ounce of</text>
  <text start="936.779" dur="3.75">gold you can buy a tenth of an ounce a</text>
  <text start="938.399" dur="5.221">quarter same thing with silver actually</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="3.571">Silver&amp;#39;s very cheap you can buy one</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="4.25">ounce</text>
  <text start="944.1" dur="6.15">half ounce a quarter of an ounce and</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="4.959">remember if we look at the 1913</text>
  <text start="950.25" dur="4.62">calculations gold should be around six</text>
  <text start="952.829" dur="4.531">grand right now and silver should be</text>
  <text start="954.87" dur="5.19">around 700 why do you think China and</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="6.13">Russia have accumulated so much gold you</text>
  <text start="960.06" dur="8.63">think they just did it just to do it no</text>
  <text start="963.49" dur="7.36">country&amp;#39;s central banks investors they</text>
  <text start="968.69" dur="4.98">only do things because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="970.85" dur="6.15">going to happen Russia and China they</text>
  <text start="973.67" dur="6.599">knew they know that this system couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="977" dur="6.44">can&amp;#39;t last forever and they needed an</text>
  <text start="980.269" dur="6.091">insurance policy to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="983.44" dur="6.04">you should have that insurance policy to</text>
  <text start="986.36" dur="4.68">protect yourself because eventually</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="3.419">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="991.04" dur="3.9">come out of this system and this is the</text>
  <text start="992.899" dur="3.81">central bankers central banker system</text>
  <text start="994.94" dur="3.449">that will be coming out of will be</text>
  <text start="996.709" dur="5.13">moving into a sound money system and</text>
  <text start="998.389" dur="6.781">just imagine if you owned silver gold</text>
  <text start="1001.839" dur="5.94">copper junk silver and we moved into a</text>
  <text start="1005.17" dur="5.909">sound money system think about those</text>
  <text start="1007.779" dur="7.591">that have it and those that don&amp;#39;t who&amp;#39;s</text>
