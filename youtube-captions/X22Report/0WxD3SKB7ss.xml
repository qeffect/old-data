  <text start="68.729" dur="7.351">geopolitical news now the US government</text>
  <text start="71.759" dur="6.421">they will never stop trying to spy on</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="3.99">each and every one of us and we know</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="5.1">they use the spying for many different</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="7.22">event agendas they use it to blackmail</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="7.65">judges they use it to blackmail</text>
  <text start="87.29" dur="5.859">government employees they use it to keep</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="5.28">track of certain people or certain</text>

  <text start="104.159" dur="3.721">going to an old complete overhaul of the</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.35">NSA which they never did they said</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re going to discontinue the Patriot</text>
  <text start="110.19" dur="3.9">Act but they just created the USA</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="4.98">Freedom Act which allows the</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="4.11">corporations to spy on every single</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="2.79">person so they really didn&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.37">anything actually they made it easier</text>
  <text start="119.4" dur="5.28">for themselves because they shifted the</text>
  <text start="122.57" dur="5.65">responsibility over to the corporations</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="7.32">and all they&amp;#39;re waiting for is sista or</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="6.239">sissa to be passed so they can collect</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.19">that information and not have these</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="3.75">corporations be liable for it and this</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="5.519">is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="6.84">through but it has been shut down every</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="6">single time but there was a leaked memo</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="6.811">that shows the White House explored all</text>
  <text start="148.709" dur="6.151">different ways for law enforcement to</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="5.34">unlock encrypted smartphones here are</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="3.75">some of the ideas that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.02">use they wanted to separate encryption</text>
  <text start="158.61" dur="5.459">keys or spyware embedded in automatic</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="5.76">software updates they</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="5.131">wanted the providers to add a separate</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.099">encrypted port to their devices through</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="4.799">which any law enforcement could access</text>
  <text start="172.079" dur="4.08">the data after receiving a warrant by</text>
  <text start="173.999" dur="5.58">using a set of keys that only they would</text>
  <text start="176.159" dur="5.791">have but when they do this it&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="179.579" dur="6.27">and security and other hackers can have</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="7.769">access to it another approach was to add</text>
  <text start="185.849" dur="6.601">spyware to automatic software updates</text>
  <text start="189.719" dur="5.371">and this is something that hackers use</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="5.67">today but they wanted to use it where</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="4.549">you got a software update and it allowed</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="4.679">them to have access to your phone</text>
  <text start="199.639" dur="5.171">another method was splitting up</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="4.741">encryption keys that could be combined</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="4.56">under court order a fourth solution</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="3.869">involved a forced back up where they</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="5.489">would just take all the information from</text>
  <text start="211.409" dur="8.7">your phone and store it on an</text>
  <text start="214.859" dur="7.171">unencrypted location and technologists</text>
  <text start="220.109" dur="5.22">have warned that this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="7.859">ridiculous they&amp;#39;re removing the security</text>
  <text start="225.329" dur="8.791">and allowing others to find the holes</text>
  <text start="229.889" dur="6.57">and to break in and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.039">happen before and this is why we all</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="7.101">need to take responsibility to make sure</text>
  <text start="239.159" dur="8.22">and make it harder for the government to</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="6.069">spy on us I mean on the x 22 report.com</text>
  <text start="247.379" dur="5.67">site on the right-hand side scroll down</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="6.33">someone introduced me into PI crypt he</text>
  <text start="253.049" dur="4.771">created it and I put the link there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="3.81">open source where you can encrypt</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="3.87">messages you could take a look at that</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="4.351">go over to it you can take a look at it</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="7.819">see what it&amp;#39;s like you can use start</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="8.849">page this will hide your searches</text>
  <text start="269.509" dur="6.46">someone mentioned a tor browser which</text>
  <text start="272.969" dur="7.17">will keep you completely anonymous for</text>
  <text start="275.969" dur="6.871">your credit card for your driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="5.791">license you can use a product called</text>

  <text start="285.93" dur="5.039">they&amp;#39;re just sleeves and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="5.19">intertwined interwoven with metals like</text>
  <text start="290.969" dur="3.961">silver copper and it blocks the signal</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="4.53">so if you have a credit card with an</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="5.25">RFID chip you slip it into there</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="3.78">close it and it will block the signal so</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="3.42">if someone&amp;#39;s walking by with a scanner</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.69">they can&amp;#39;t lift your information the</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="3.93">same thing with the smart with the real</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="3.87">IDs that are going to replace the</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="3.72">driver&amp;#39;s license the new ones are going</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="3.24">to have these chips in them and it will</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="2.94">block the signal you can use them for</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="5.7">your phone you can use them for your</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="5.73">iPad and it will cut off the signal so</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="4.17">you cannot be tracked so there are all</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="5.4">different ways that you can protect</text>
  <text start="322.32" dur="5.22">yourself and I know with smart page if</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="3.93">you decide to use one of the proxies</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="4.19">there to completely hide your location</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="5.25">sometimes the websites don&amp;#39;t come up</text>
  <text start="331.73" dur="5.8">that great some of the functionality</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="7.56">does not work but if you don&amp;#39;t use that</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="9.51">function at least Google doesn&amp;#39;t connect</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="6.3">your searches with you now DHS we know</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve been working on this kill switch</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="8.34">to kill cell phones if something happens</text>
  <text start="351.42" dur="7.71">like a false flag and in in the Boston</text>
  <text start="356.7" dur="4.47">bombing and many different incidences</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="4.65">what they did was they shut down the</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="4.56">cell towers to stop people from calling</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="4.08">out and sending pictures but what they</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t realize was once the towers came</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="4.08">back up people started sending pictures</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="4.5">all over the place and this posed a</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="5.1">problem and this is why they are looking</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.26">to put and most likely everyone has the</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="3.66">kill switch on their phone so if</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.94">something happens in an area your phone</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="5.91">will just die now what are they working</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="4.35">on well the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="4.41">Security has revealed that is working</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="5.49">with boeing company to develop a</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="8.85">so-called brain chip that would allow</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="7.11">any smartphone to self-destruct now in</text>
  <text start="399.87" dur="3.33">theory this technology will provide</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="4.2">users with additional intelligence</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="5.48">security so that an event a smart phone</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="8.19">is stolen or lost the device will</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="8.23">basically just self-destruct and how</text>
  <text start="414" dur="6.84">does it know you know if it was stolen</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="7.68">or anything like that well the chip will</text>
  <text start="420.84" dur="9.129">detect unusual activity by accessing</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="7.149">your camera your microphone</text>
  <text start="429.969" dur="6.48">because it&amp;#39;s going to track the way you</text>
  <text start="431.739" dur="6.81">talk the way you walk your behavior as</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="6.12">you use your phone so do you really</text>
  <text start="438.549" dur="6.78">think this is all for the self-destruct</text>
  <text start="442.569" dur="5.82">or are they trying to correlate this in</text>
  <text start="445.329" dur="6.32">a database somewhere to match you up</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="7.05">with people who are using cell phones</text>
  <text start="451.649" dur="6.64">because it seems to me that that would</text>
  <text start="455.439" dur="5.52">be a great way to track each individual</text>
  <text start="458.289" dur="4.47">because each individual their movement</text>
  <text start="460.959" dur="6.02">the way they talk on the phone the way</text>
  <text start="462.759" dur="4.22">they use it is completely different and</text>
  <text start="467.039" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re saying oh no we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="470.079" dur="4.531">this for you know high-level government</text>
  <text start="472.719" dur="5.85">employees just in case the phone gets</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="5.279">stolen but it seems to me that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="3.93">going to be using this for something</text>
  <text start="479.889" dur="4.05">else down the line and they always give</text>
  <text start="482.499" dur="3.57">the story that oh no we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="483.939" dur="5.31">it for this but it seems like this is</text>
  <text start="486.069" dur="4.92">just another way of tracking each person</text>
  <text start="489.249" dur="4.47">so they&amp;#39;re going to access your camera</text>
  <text start="490.989" dur="4.92">your microphone and your touchpad on</text>
  <text start="493.719" dur="5.97">your phone and record all this</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="5.88">information very interesting and if you</text>
  <text start="499.689" dur="4.23">notice the White House is continually</text>
  <text start="501.789" dur="3.87">trying to figure out ways and how to get</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="3.65">through the encryption of your phone and</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="3.9">if you notice from the leaked memo</text>
  <text start="507.569" dur="3.97">they&amp;#39;re never going to stop they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.559" dur="4.53">never going to say oh no we decided not</text>
  <text start="511.539" dur="3.93">to do this no no they&amp;#39;re always doing</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="5.911">this they&amp;#39;re just finding different ways</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="6.2">to do it now this sunday we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.129">have to watch Spain and Catalonia</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="5.35">there&amp;#39;s going to be referendum and a lot</text>
  <text start="525.129" dur="6.361">of people saying well could this kick</text>
  <text start="527.019" dur="8.01">off a Black Swan type of scenario and we</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="6.18">know that the Bank of Spain brought in</text>
  <text start="535.029" dur="4.23">all these vans they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="4.229">comment of what they were doing there</text>
  <text start="539.259" dur="4.68">they pulled up something was loaded into</text>
  <text start="541.899" dur="4.651">them most likely gold and then they were</text>
  <text start="543.939" dur="5.94">driven away and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="6.36">that on September 27th the election in</text>
  <text start="549.879" dur="6.27">Catalonia which really accounts for</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="6.06">nineteen percent of Spanish GDP is going</text>
  <text start="556.149" dur="5.461">to be voted on and if they decide that</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="3.84">you know they want to be separate and</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="3.12">apart</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="4.56">this could really muddy the waters</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="4.95">further ahead of general elections in</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="4.44">December creating further uncertainty</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="4.23">and adding yet another destabilizing</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="5.28">element to an already fragile situation</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="7.23">in the EU I mean think about what we</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="10.05">have here France Italy Spain Greece</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="8.639">Cyprus Portugal you know all teetering</text>
  <text start="587.14" dur="6.36">on disaster and if Catalonia breaks</text>
  <text start="589.779" dur="6.541">apart from Spain this could be this</text>
  <text start="593.5" dur="4.589">could have a disastrous effect across</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="4.019">Europe because other countries are going</text>
  <text start="598.089" dur="6.511">to say well wait a minute they&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="600.339" dur="7.531">done this so can we and this could be a</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="6.21">huge problem now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="607.87" dur="5.67">additional warnings out of Malaysia I</text>
  <text start="610.81" dur="5.279">mentioned that the u.s. gave a warning</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="5.16">to the people in Malaysia US citizens to</text>
  <text start="616.089" dur="5.401">be very wary that there could be a</text>

  <text start="1239.36" dur="4.68">never admit that they were wrong they</text>
  <text start="1241.94" dur="6.3">can never admit that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1244.04" dur="7.71">is their proxy army because if they do</text>
  <text start="1248.24" dur="7.38">do this think about think of the</text>
  <text start="1251.75" dur="8.15">ramifications now let&amp;#39;s say the United</text>

  <text start="1259.9" dur="7.96">really not a terrorist group it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1263.24" dur="6.99">proxy army for the United States you</text>
  <text start="1267.86" dur="7.58">know all those videos that we saw of the</text>

  <text start="1287" dur="8.22">States at this point I mean it would be</text>
  <text start="1291.26" dur="6.8">a complete disaster so when you think</text>
  <text start="1295.22" dur="7.26">about these videos now are they real or</text>
  <text start="1298.06" dur="7.78">are they really fake we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1302.48" dur="5.58">fake but they can&amp;#39;t admit to this</text>
  <text start="1305.84" dur="4.8">because this whole thing would</text>
  <text start="1308.06" dur="5.13">completely fall apart and if you notice</text>
  <text start="1310.64" dur="4.65">from their actions and I say the US</text>
  <text start="1313.19" dur="5.37">government central bankers they&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="1315.29" dur="5.79">admit it they&amp;#39;ll keep pushing to the</text>
  <text start="1318.56" dur="4.32">very end yes they might be sidelined a</text>
  <text start="1321.08" dur="4.97">little bit but they&amp;#39;ll come up with a</text>
  <text start="1322.88" dur="7.11">new plan and come back even stronger now</text>
  <text start="1326.05" dur="6.76">Russia has introduced a UN resolution</text>
  <text start="1329.99" dur="5.61">saying that we should call the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1332.81" dur="5.28">state a global terrorist group which</text>
  <text start="1335.6" dur="7.73">means that every single country can go</text>
  <text start="1338.09" dur="9.21">after the Islamic state the UN says yes</text>
  <text start="1343.33" dur="8.11">that means it&amp;#39;s fair game guess who</text>
  <text start="1347.3" dur="8.37">opposes this the United States now why</text>
  <text start="1351.44" dur="7.5">would they do that unless it is the</text>
  <text start="1355.67" dur="7.08">proxy army for them and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1358.94" dur="6.059">what it is because their actions show</text>
  <text start="1362.75" dur="5.159">you that</text>
  <text start="1364.999" dur="6.48">the Islamic state is not a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1367.909" dur="9">group al-qaeda is not a terrorist group</text>
  <text start="1371.479" dur="10.02">all this security is a waste of time and</text>

  <text start="1381.499" dur="9.72">that&amp;#39;s it because now reverse and go</text>
  <text start="1385.909" dur="8.88">back well if al-qaeda is a government</text>
  <text start="1391.219" dur="6.12">entity and the Islamic state is a</text>
  <text start="1394.789" dur="4.47">government entity there is no terrorism</text>
  <text start="1397.339" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s no need for the pat downs</text>

  <text start="1478.039" dur="8.97">of China Z Jinping was here to talk</text>
  <text start="1483.169" dur="5.19">about cyber attacks the Chinese</text>
  <text start="1487.009" dur="4.32">President thought he was coming over to</text>
  <text start="1488.359" dur="6.18">sign something to say okay we agree we</text>
  <text start="1491.329" dur="5.31">should not be doing cyber attacks and of</text>
  <text start="1494.539" dur="3.421">course the president of China saying we</text>
  <text start="1496.639" dur="4.381">didn&amp;#39;t attack you</text>
  <text start="1497.96" dur="5.9">please show us the evidence well we have</text>
  <text start="1501.02" dur="5.789">the IP address well as everyone knows</text>
  <text start="1503.86" dur="4.689">the IP IP address is meaningless because</text>
  <text start="1506.809" dur="4.711">you can bounce this off server to server</text>
  <text start="1508.549" dur="4.291">to server and you can mask it and it you</text>
  <text start="1511.52" dur="4.47">can make it look like it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="1512.84" dur="6.6">China or use a server in China for the</text>
  <text start="1515.99" dur="4.74">attack so that&amp;#39;s kind of meaningless but</text>
  <text start="1519.44" dur="5">what happened was they didn&amp;#39;t sign</text>

  <text start="1524.44" dur="5.26">mutual agreement which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1527.899" dur="3.66">meaningless and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="1529.7" dur="3.75">might have signed anything because that</text>
  <text start="1531.559" dur="6.331">would hold the US government central</text>
  <text start="1533.45" dur="7.199">mangoes accountable and they know they</text>
  <text start="1537.89" dur="5.61">need to blame this on China on North</text>
  <text start="1540.649" dur="7.52">Korea on Russia and they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="1543.5" dur="9.179">a cyberattack when all else fails and</text>
  <text start="1548.169" dur="6.461">this is where we are headed and this is</text>
