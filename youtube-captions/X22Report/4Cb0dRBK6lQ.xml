  <text start="54.93" dur="4.29">as well of course they&amp;#39;re out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="4.95">blaming this on the brexit this is why</text>
  <text start="59.22" dur="6.06">the stock market is falling we see right</text>
  <text start="62.04" dur="5.94">now that gold and silver they have moved</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="6.81">up a little bit and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="67.98" dur="6.63">realize that as we move forward when you</text>
  <text start="72.09" dur="4.74">really need to watch the precious metals</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="4.68">market because when things start to</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="6">rapidly fall apart we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="6.66">gold and silver explode and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="4.56">to see gains of fifty sixty a hundred a</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.72">hundred and fifty dollars and we start</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="5.519">seeing that this is when everyone should</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="6.36">say okay here it comes we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="5.761">down that path we&amp;#39;re about to go here</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="4.65">and at the same time we will be seeing</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="6.089">the stock market collapse at the same</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="5.84">exact time but what we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="6.03">at and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="106.52" dur="8.44">researching we&amp;#39;ve been watching this</text>
  <text start="110.789" dur="9.421">economy implode on itself every single</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="6.99">day and it is not getting better at all</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s actually getting worse as we</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="6.029">continually move on here now we know a</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="5.251">lot of people went back to school we</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.461">know they took out student loans and we</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="7.41">know a lot of the graduates they cannot</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="6.09">find a job which means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="4.76">going to be delinquent on their loans</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="5.64">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="6.34">coming from the Federal Reserve Bank of</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="6.6">New York they already estimated that 90</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="6.21">plus state delinquent loans to be over</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="6.6">eleven percent this puts two loans at</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="4.95">the higher delinquency rate than credit</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="4.5">cards which is seven point six percent</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="4.32">auto loans which are at three point five</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="7.5">percent mortgages which is</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="6.899">2.2% so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.009">everything we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="171.329" dur="6.36">where graduates cannot find the the</text>
  <text start="174.379" dur="4.59">high-paying jobs they cannot make ends</text>
  <text start="177.689" dur="5.851">meet they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="178.969" dur="5.83">this is all true actually the Federal</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="3.809">Reserve Bank of New York found that</text>
  <text start="184.799" dur="7.02">forty-nine percent of college graduates</text>
  <text start="187.349" dur="7.17">age 22 to 27 they were working in</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="6.691">careers right now where they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="7.411">need college education which shows us</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="7.11">that these people are not working in the</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="6.149">field they went to school for they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="4.739">not finding those high-paying jobs that</text>
  <text start="208.079" dur="4.201">everyone promised them and I know a lot</text>
  <text start="210.359" dur="6.3">of people out there that are graduating</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="5.97">and they cannot find work now is this</text>
  <text start="216.659" dur="3.571">happening to every single person but no</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="5.129">we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen to the majority</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="6.569">of the people and it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="223.379" dur="5.811">and worse what else are we seeing well</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="8.131">we have many other indicators here</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="7.78">retail sales in luxury items coming from</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.339">bank of america credit and debit card</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="6.419">spending data guess what it is declining</text>
  <text start="240.269" dur="7.14">home improvement related spending well</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="7.13">that is declining too so when you look</text>
  <text start="247.409" dur="10.05">at this this is very easy to calculate</text>
  <text start="250.519" dur="10.421">GDP is based on all of this and without</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="6.421">a strong rebound in spending there can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="5.52">be a strong rebound in gdp it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="6.06">completely impossible and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="7.59">that sales at luxury retailers it has</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="8.13">dropped from 2011 from thirty-five</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="6.69">percent all the way down to around two</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="6.11">to three percent here we see home</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="7.47">improvement where we&amp;#39;ve had the height</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="8.26">back in 2011 around eleven twelve</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="8.25">percent it is now down to six seven</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="5.76">percent building materials actually are</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="4.95">at negative five percent</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="5.67">but we&amp;#39;re having a housing boom it makes</text>
  <text start="301.41" dur="4.98">no sense and the reason why it makes no</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="6.14">sense is because this whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="8.79">complete illusion the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="9.07">it is formed by 1.2 609 now something</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="8.85">very interesting here is that we</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="7.89">definitely have a pension bubble problem</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="5.46">and we see a lot of people working</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="4.83">worrying about the stock market worrying</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="7.77">about real estate but we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="6.87">seeing a bubble in pension plans pension</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="3.33">funds which have been issuing</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="4.74">over-optimistic revenue forecasts for</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="4.32">many many many years aren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="4.88">earn nearly enough money to pay the</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="6.18">benefits that these recipients expect</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="6.43">bonds which form a major part of the</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="6.95">most plans well they&amp;#39;re earning next to</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="7.38">nothing and interest we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="6.82">defaults on pension obligations actually</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s already started to happen we know</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="4.26">that the u.s. central state pension fund</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.07">whose 400,000 beneficiaries were</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="4.17">recently offered cuts of up to 60</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="7.86">percent and the amounts they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="7.95">receive that is a warning sign and when</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.82">we move forward here we look at the</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="7.7">whole entire situation and we see that</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="9.06">companies in 37 states well guess what</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="8.26">they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay out</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="5.91">this entire system is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="5.37">and we see multiple bubbles in different</text>
  <text start="399.35" dur="5.2">areas we see it in the pension area we</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="3.87">see it in the stocks we see it in the</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="6.3">bond market we see it in the derivative</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="6.27">market and when we look at all of this</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="5.85">and we look at what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="5.91">have done they&amp;#39;ve created a system that</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="5.31">cannot be sustained which does not</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="5.43">benefit the people which cannot work in</text>
  <text start="422.01" dur="7.07">the long run the only ones that it</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="7.44">benefits is themselves now back in</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="5.47">2007-2008 the</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="6.81">US economy entered a recession which we</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="5.399">all know we all remember and of course</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="3.42">ninety-nine percent of the economist</text>
  <text start="439.949" dur="4.62">they didn&amp;#39;t even see it coming they told</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="5.129">us the economy was strong it&amp;#39;s solid</text>
  <text start="444.569" dur="4.651">it&amp;#39;s contained nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="4.111">the stock market is soaring what is</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="3.15">everyone complaining about and then all</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="4.56">of a sudden everything fell apart and</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="6.15">all of a sudden these 99% of these</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.799">economies just kind of scurried off into</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="5.31">their holes and didn&amp;#39;t say anything for</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="6.66">quite a while but there&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="7.19">indicator to understand what the US the</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="8.581">economy is doing we talked about the</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="6.67">personal tax receipts showing how people</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="6.12">aren&amp;#39;t working today how that has</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="7.409">declined rapidly to show that people</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="5.43">really aren&amp;#39;t spending all you have to</text>
  <text start="485.099" dur="6.181">do is look at the state sales tax</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="7.41">receipts and guess what they are</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="6.72">declining now with these two things with</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="8">people not having work people not</text>
  <text start="498" dur="6.539">spending this is a collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="6.82">waiting to happen this is what we saw</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="7.291">prior to 2007 going into 2008 and when</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="5.85">we look at this once again and we say</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="6.3">okay the US federal personal withholding</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="6.5">tax receipts back in 2013 we hit a</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="8.04">height of about four fifteen percent</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="9.18">it&amp;#39;s dropped to one percent now when we</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="7.26">look at the sales the state sales tax</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="5.35">well what happened there we were at</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="5.82">eight percent back in 2013 we have</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="8.07">dropped down to about one percent right</text>
  <text start="539.25" dur="10.73">now and this shows us actually it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="8.37">warning sign that we are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="6.01">looking at commercial and industrial</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="7.289">loans well guess what the delinquencies</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="6.15">they are skyrocketing this means that</text>
  <text start="559.949" dur="5.341">businesses aren&amp;#39;t they are now late</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="4.92">making loan payments now they only do</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="4.969">this when they don&amp;#39;t have the cash handy</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="7.529">to pay the bank and this only occurs</text>
  <text start="570.259" dur="7.781">during recessions and when we look at</text>
  <text start="574.589" dur="9.17">this once again we see back in 2008</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="8.94">going it into 2009 it&amp;#39;s skyrocketed and</text>
  <text start="583.759" dur="8.07">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the same</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="10.44">thing since 2015 the Lincoln see rate</text>
  <text start="591.829" dur="14.231">has skyrocketed back in 2009 it hit</text>
  <text start="597.42" dur="11.789">about 145 we are at 100 right now we are</text>
  <text start="606.06" dur="5.61">headed in the same direction and just to</text>
  <text start="609.209" dur="5.731">let everyone know this from the</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="8.849">beginning of 2015 it started at negative</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="9.959">20 by the end of 2015 it hit 100 in 2016</text>
  <text start="620.519" dur="6.99">we&amp;#39;re already close to 120 so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="4.74">seeing right now is everything rapidly</text>
  <text start="627.509" dur="4.77">falling apart very very quickly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.639" dur="4.651">deteriorating there&amp;#39;s no two ways of</text>
  <text start="632.279" dur="3.721">looking at this now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="634.29" dur="5.669">interesting about this we see state</text>
  <text start="636" dur="6.51">sales tax receipts declining we see</text>
  <text start="639.959" dur="5.391">personal tax receipts from the federal</text>
  <text start="642.51" dur="6.269">government declining delinquencies</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="5.44">skyrocketing we see delinquencies and</text>
  <text start="648.779" dur="4.29">student loans and then the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="650.79" dur="4.62">Journal they need to explain her weight</text>
  <text start="653.069" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s happening here so they came out</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="5.669">and said retail sales and consumer</text>
  <text start="658.769" dur="5.211">spending isn&amp;#39;t everything we really</text>
  <text start="661.079" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t need that to support the economy</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="5.919">well wait a minute they told us we</text>
  <text start="667.079" dur="7.38">didn&amp;#39;t need manufacturing they told us</text>
  <text start="669.899" dur="7.261">that this is a service country now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.459" dur="4.801">all dependent on spending and retail</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="7.07">sales now they&amp;#39;re telling us we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="679.26" dur="8.309">need that what is left in this country</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="5.229">nothing because what&amp;#39;s happening now is</text>
  <text start="687.569" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="689.459" dur="4.201">explain away what&amp;#39;s really happening and</text>
  <text start="691.439" dur="4.471">that is the economy is collapsing things</text>
  <text start="693.66" dur="4.83">are rapidly falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="3.36">running out of excuses of how to explain</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="3.69">this</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t you get to a certain point where</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s nothing left to say I mean yes</text>
  <text start="705.24" dur="2.4">you can just say yeah that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="3.18">matter that doesn&amp;#39;t matter that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="707.64" dur="4.08">matter and pretty soon you&amp;#39;re left with</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="6.3">nothing and everything that you said</text>
  <text start="711.72" dur="7.26">didn&amp;#39;t matter really does matter we see</text>
  <text start="716.04" dur="5.31">the ECB right now they started to</text>
  <text start="718.98" dur="3.6">purchase corporate bonds they spent</text>
  <text start="721.35" dur="4.26">about three hundred and forty-eight</text>
  <text start="722.58" dur="6.39">million euros right now to purchase</text>
  <text start="725.61" dur="5.55">these they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the system</text>
  <text start="728.97" dur="4.47">alive right now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="5.31">everything actually but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="733.44" dur="6.6">going to be able to do this we see more</text>
  <text start="736.47" dur="6.03">European banks they are failing the</text>
