  <text start="109.33" dur="8.52">their agenda is to never let a country</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="5.399">leave their system ever and we can see</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="3.9">this is what&amp;#39;s happening out in the UK I</text>

  <text start="126.25" dur="4.59">that listen you don&amp;#39;t need to be part of</text>
  <text start="128.049" dur="5.671">the EU you don&amp;#39;t have to be part of this</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="5.79">and we can see at this time that this</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="4.799">brexit well it looks like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="3.75">to miss the deadline and it looks like</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="6.121">there is no deal whatsoever right now</text>
  <text start="140.38" dur="5.91">and Monday&amp;#39;s meeting might be cancelled</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="5.939">maybe they&amp;#39;ve cancelled it already and</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="6.06">we can see that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="150.579" dur="3.091">are never gonna let this happen and</text>
  <text start="152.35" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;ve said this many many times before</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="4.62">because this will send a message to</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="5.31">around around the world to all the other</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="6.419">countries that this can be done and they</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="4.56">do not want this message sent out so we</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="3.241">can see that it&amp;#39;s completely breaking</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="4.47">down and we need to realize and</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="4.56">understand that the central banks they</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="5.4">are very very desperate at this point</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.009">remember their system is designed to</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="3.059">only last a certain period of time now</text>
  <text start="177.519" dur="3.331">of course the central bankers know this</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="3.78">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize this and</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m sure the major population doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.739" dur="3.301">realize that their system will only go</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="3.839">to a certain period of</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="4.77">before the debt overtakes everything</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="5.401">else and collapses every single country</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="5.22">now if they allow this to happen every</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="4.62">country would start collapsing under the</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="4.409">debt load people would lose jobs people</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="3.06">will say why did this happen who was in</text>
  <text start="200.439" dur="3.571">control of this and it would all come</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="5.58">back to the central banks this is what</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="5.729">they&amp;#39;re most worried about they usually</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="4.38">have some type of an event to cover this</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="4.021">up like war but we can see that this</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="3.48">isn&amp;#39;t happening even through bad times</text>
  <text start="213.76" dur="4.11">like when we were going through this</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="4.619">recovery which we you know allegedly</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="4.199">still are there&amp;#39;s really never been a</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="5.97">recovery but we&amp;#39;ll just use their terms</text>
  <text start="222.069" dur="5.76">of a recovery since 2008-2009 the IMF</text>
  <text start="225.819" dur="3.901">has been out there and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="227.829" dur="4.611">making projections saying how great it</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="5.79">is and look we&amp;#39;re gonna hit a GDP of 4%</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="5.829">3.9 percent it always comes down after</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="5.58">that and what&amp;#39;s very interesting they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="4.8">been telling us how great things are how</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="4.56">everything is improving now this was</text>
  <text start="243.069" dur="5.101">part of their plan remember to convince</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="6.149">you that the economy was doing well and</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="7.92">then all of a sudden we entered an event</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="7.111">a war and you had a sacrifice credit</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="4.59">froze up because of that and it was very</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="4.17">difficult to get supplies and things</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="4.109">like that but they had an out so this</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="3.78">way they showed you the economy was</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="5.31">doing well the economy collapsed because</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="5.339">of the event war the problem is they</text>
  <text start="270.099" dur="5.371">don&amp;#39;t have that event or period right</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="5.701">now and they&amp;#39;re very very desperate so</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="4.71">the International Monetary Fund who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.9" dur="6.269">been you know very bullish very</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="7.53">optimistic throughout 2008 9 all the way</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="5.43">up to 2016 maybe even 2017 and we know</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="4.199">that the IMF and other central banks</text>
  <text start="289.599" dur="3.781">have come out and said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.909" dur="2.94">heading towards another Great Depression</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="3.33">of course they tried to blame this on</text>
  <text start="294.849" dur="4.531">Trump they&amp;#39;re still blaming it on Trump</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="5.07">and the Patriots we&amp;#39;re you know because</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="5.819">of his policies of fiscal policies with</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="5.49">trade wars and tariffs it&amp;#39;s breaking</text>
  <text start="305.199" dur="5.161">down the entire global economic scene</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="5.55">now we know that this is not true we</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="3.929">know the entire global economic scene</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="5.19">has been breaking down for many many</text>
  <text start="314.289" dur="4.491">years they&amp;#39;ve come out and they have</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="4.57">admitted</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="5.21">that they might have been too bullish to</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="5.89">over-optimistic</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="5.82">going into 2017-2018 1920 and now</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;re saying they have to scale back</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="5.35">the growth because of the emerging</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="4.861">markets because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="5.37">with other countries what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="5.46">with brexit and the problem is is</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re telling us all of this and</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are responsible for</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="5.19">all of it and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="4.68">out a way out of this I mean the ECB</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="4.86">right now and central banks are famous</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="5.43">for this they never admit when there is</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="5.76">a bubble now the ECB they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="5.04">mention the word bubble all over the</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="5.13">place there are risks that bubbles might</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="5.7">be building up there are risks that</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="5.13">assets might be mispriced market</text>
  <text start="369.63" dur="4.74">participants might become too lenient</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="5.25">when assessing the real value of assets</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="5.1">and they&amp;#39;re continually out there saying</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="6.119">this for a reason they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="379.47" dur="6">trying to project this onto somebody</text>
  <text start="382.979" dur="3.811">else away from them and this is why</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re mentioning this right now</text>
  <text start="386.79" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to point the fingers away</text>
  <text start="389.76" dur="5.85">from the central bank to some other area</text>
  <text start="393.03" dur="4.8">and they&amp;#39;re doing as much as they</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.74">possibly can actually the ECB is saying</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="4.29">that the financial stability just</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t concern the banking sister but</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="5.52">also the shadow banking sector which</text>
  <text start="405.72" dur="5.04">accounts for 40% of the EU financial</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="6.899">system might be in trouble that might be</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="6.48">it is in trouble the entire system is in</text>

  <text start="432.539" dur="4.44">because what the US has been doing</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="4.47">because what the Fed has been doing now</text>

  <text start="448.26" dur="4.13">putting them in a tough position because</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="5.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to blame him</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="6.42">and defend the Fed at the same time and</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="8.76">this is very difficult to do they are</text>
