  <text start="136.89" dur="4.179">year hey maybe they&amp;#39;ll throw in more QE</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="3.61">by doubling</text>

  <text start="143.709" dur="5.73">economy is not going to grow its going</text>
  <text start="146.439" dur="6.481">to implode that is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="149.439" dur="6">happen here now Yellen was out there</text>

  <text start="164.65" dur="5.25">everything is fantastic here and she</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="4.25">went on to say a strong economy with</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="5.94">full employment and stable prices is</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="4.81">tantalizingly on the horizon Federal</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="4.379">Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="5.16">Wednesday Yellen noted that the central</text>
  <text start="180.219" dur="5.19">bankers and many economists he returned</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="7.47">to full employment and stable prices and</text>
  <text start="185.409" dur="6.901">strong housing at the end of 2016 so</text>
  <text start="190" dur="5.48">we&amp;#39;re on the right path and by the end</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="6.09">of 2016 we are going to be fine and</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="6.7">perfect of course they put this date out</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="6.899">you know two years from now and right</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="5.579">now we are completely recovering yes we</text>
  <text start="205.299" dur="6.36">had a slow down during the winter but</text>
  <text start="207.759" dur="7.5">now the second half of 2014 is really</text>
  <text start="211.659" dur="7.41">going to really move full steam ahead</text>
  <text start="215.259" dur="5.611">and this is how we know this next event</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="4.29">is going to occur because they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="7.17">letting us know that we are on the</text>
  <text start="223.359" dur="7.71">precipice of a recovery there is</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="5.61">absolutely no way that we are on a</text>
  <text start="231.069" dur="5.07">recovery path at this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="5.25">impossible and let&amp;#39;s look at this I mean</text>
  <text start="236.139" dur="4.68">we talked about in the last couple of</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.41">days about housing is completely</text>
  <text start="240.819" dur="4.23">declining we talked about retail we know</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="3.959">stores are closing all over the place</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="3.77">people are being laid off by the</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="4.381">thousands we understand that</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="6.94">unemployment is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="7.069">and falsified to keep this illusion the</text>
  <text start="255.759" dur="5.611">Fed has been channeling money away to</text>
  <text start="258.719" dur="5.561">Belgium now to buy the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re continually pumping in the money</text>
  <text start="264.28" dur="4.199">into the banks buying the toxic real</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="4.98">estate which then in turn these banks</text>
  <text start="268.479" dur="6.541">pump it back into the stock amarte the</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="6.3">stock market to pump it up so again</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="5.78">things changed it&amp;#39;s the exact same place</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="5.039">where we were back when they started</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="4.179">stimulating the economy but actually</text>
  <text start="282.849" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s worse now because now we have more</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="4.891">debt we have more problems the</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="4.171">unemployment is really between thirty</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="5.669">and thirty seven percent housing is</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="5.88">imploding and it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="5.641">and we&amp;#39;re looking at this and we see the</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="4.889">Baltic Dry Index completely dropping and</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s been dropping every single day</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="4.891">during a since the start of this year</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s just getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="4.62">and right now industrial production</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="5.37">growth slows as manufacturing completely</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="5.31">misses this is the fourth miss of the</text>
  <text start="315.25" dur="6.83">last five months for manufacturing</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="8.31">production housing starts right now</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="6.489">completely it&amp;#39;s a complete miss on the</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="4.77">expectations the starts were nine</text>
  <text start="328.569" dur="6.66">hundred and forty-six thousand they were</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="6.99">expecting 970,000 and of course they</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="4.53">revised numbers and they made the</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="5.19">previous month lower to make it look</text>
  <text start="339.759" dur="6.21">great and right now housing is going</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="5.94">absolutely nowhere and in my last</text>
  <text start="345.969" dur="4.711">reports we looked into mortgage</text>
  <text start="349" dur="3.96">originations because these are the</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="4.709">American people taking out mortgages to</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="4.679">buy homes or even if their flippers or</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="5.03">anyone else but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="5.191">mortgage applications completely</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="4.75">imploding they&amp;#39;re declining they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="4.679">by sixty-six percent and the last couple</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="4.351">of days I took we looked at JPMorgan</text>
  <text start="367.509" dur="4.171">Chase&amp;#39;s books we looked at Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="4.17">but let&amp;#39;s review all this because Bank</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="4.68">of America just came out and let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="4.89">a look at how well housing is going and</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="4.799">let&amp;#39;s see if we can see some type of</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="10.23">trend we&amp;#39;ll start off with Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="381.159" dur="13.141">here now back in September of 2012 we</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="8.49">were at 139 billion worth of housing</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="6.6">originate mortgage originations going</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="7.2">from 139 billion from September 2012 to</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="5.43">march twenty 2013 we&amp;#39;re at a hundred</text>
  <text start="404.5" dur="4.32">nine billion so we&amp;#39;re seeing the trend</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="6.15">go down and then we look at</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="5.94">of 2013 which is down to 80 billion we</text>
  <text start="412.48" dur="4.89">look at December of 2013 we&amp;#39;re down to</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="4.62">50 billion and we look at March 2014</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re at 36 billion and that was Wells</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="5.13">Fargo let&amp;#39;s look at JP Morgan and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="8.51">start pretty much at the same time here</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="12.05">so we&amp;#39;re looking here at September of</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="9.07">2012 and it looks like they were at 80</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="7.39">2.7 billion and then we look at the next</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="6.36">state going forward and this is in 2013</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="4.95">of December it looks like it dropped to</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="4.62">49 billion and then let&amp;#39;s just go to</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="5.31">March 2014 because we&amp;#39;re going down</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="7.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re at 17 billion right</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.97">now now let&amp;#39;s take a look at a citibank</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="4.77">now we look starting that January of</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="6.57">2012 and it looks like their loan</text>
  <text start="462.91" dur="6.24">origination was around 20 billion and we</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="4.74">can see it declining since that point in</text>
  <text start="469.15" dur="7.58">September it looks like it went down to</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="8.88">a 10 billion and now here we are at</text>
  <text start="476.73" dur="5.56">March 2014 and we&amp;#39;re looking at seven</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="3.78">billion now Bank of America just came</text>
  <text start="482.29" dur="3.6">out and they&amp;#39;re saying that you know</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="2.94">their losses because of lawsuits and</text>
  <text start="485.89" dur="2.43">thing like this but all the banks are</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="3.17">showing that they haven&amp;#39;t done well at</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="4.41">all and now here&amp;#39;s Bank of America with</text>
  <text start="490.26" dur="5.65">real estate and we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="492.73" dur="6.06">same time periods here and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="495.91" dur="6.6">that Bank of America started in 2012</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="6.93">they started at twenty three point nine</text>
  <text start="502.51" dur="5.85">billion it decreased to twenty two point</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="6.09">six billion in September it went down to</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="6.27">eleven point six billion in the December</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="6.68">and now March 2014 there at eight point</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="6.45">nine billion so we can see that the</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="4.06">mortgage originations are completely</text>
  <text start="521.08" dur="3.12">falling in every single one of the</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="4.08">things now I can understand if it was</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="4.38">one bank and the other ones were showing</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="4.38">positive signs and i would say okay</text>
  <text start="528.58" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s not but it not a big deal here</text>
  <text start="531.01" dur="5.28">but when all the banks are showing that</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="7.2">all their mortgage origination have</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="5.9">dropped dramatically we have a huge huge</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="4.49">problem that means</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="5.1">housing is not on its way up it&amp;#39;s on its</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="3.57">way down and really if you look at Bank</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="3.3">of America right now which is the last</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="4.28">one of the last banks to report right</text>
  <text start="550.59" dur="4.98">now their retail mortgage originations</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="5.11">are down twenty four percent in the</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="5.64">fourth quarter of 2013 and down over</text>
  <text start="558.12" dur="5.34">sixty percent from the 1st quarter of</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="5.07">2013 so throughout the whole year they</text>
  <text start="563.46" dur="5.34">have dropped completely to this point</text>
  <text start="566.28" dur="6.75">and here in 2014 it is at its lowest</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="6.45">point yet so what does this tell us it</text>
  <text start="573.03" dur="4.86">tells us the American people are</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.65">completely tapped out they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="577.89" dur="6.78">the wealth they don&amp;#39;t have the funds and</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="7.74">they are not buying homes soon this</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="5.34">entire housing market is going to</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="4.68">collapse and it&amp;#39;s going and once it</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="4.41">starts it&amp;#39;s going to be very very fast</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="3.3">just like it was back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="3.36">eight if you look at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="3.9">2008 was very slow people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="3.39">understand what was going on it sped up</text>
  <text start="599.52" dur="4.59">a little bit in the summer and then boom</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="4.8">october two thousand eight things went</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="4.17">crazy housing just kept on going down</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="4.56">down faster and faster and faster we are</text>
  <text start="608.28" dur="5.58">going to see the same exact thing happen</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="6.03">at this point now this is not all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="5.61">happening we have to remember that all</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="4.71">the countries that are private western</text>

  <text start="884.67" dur="5.34">smash and let me just remind everyone</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="5.17">when Goldman was out there last year</text>
  <text start="890.01" dur="6">telling everyone that gold was going to</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="7.68">come down as these people were selling</text>
  <text start="896.01" dur="8.34">their gold Goldman Sachs was purchasing</text>
  <text start="900.15" dur="7.71">it because they knew this dive in gold</text>
  <text start="904.35" dur="5.28">prices back in April was only going to</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="3.33">be temporary and it was going to go</text>
  <text start="909.63" dur="4.14">right back up so when it reach the</text>
  <text start="911.19" dur="5.28">lowest point they started buying up all</text>
  <text start="913.77" dur="4.71">this gold and then right afterwards the</text>
  <text start="916.47" dur="5.97">gold went back up so everyone get out of</text>
  <text start="918.48" dur="5.88">gold Goldman was buying gold but Goldman</text>

  <text start="937.77" dur="3.93">going to get a lot better on the second</text>
  <text start="940.2" dur="2.97">half of this year it&amp;#39;s almost like when</text>
  <text start="941.7" dur="3.3">Goldman told us to buy these</text>
  <text start="943.17" dur="4.08">prime securities these are triple a</text>
  <text start="945" dur="4.11">rating rated and they were betting</text>
  <text start="947.25" dur="4.26">against them that they were completely</text>
  <text start="949.11" dur="4.74">implode on themselves while tho is set</text>
  <text start="951.51" dur="5.069">while they were selling it to investors</text>
  <text start="953.85" dur="4.859">and dr. Roberts came out to say the</text>
  <text start="956.579" dur="4.681">American economy is not going to boom</text>
  <text start="958.709" dur="4.291">because real consumer incomes have been</text>
  <text start="961.26" dur="4.74">falling and I reported this on yesterday</text>
  <text start="963" dur="5.36">incomes in America have dropped by seven</text>
  <text start="966" dur="6.36">point six percent that people have lost</text>
  <text start="968.36" dur="6.19">thirty-eight percent of their wealth if</text>
  <text start="972.36" dur="4.86">there is no income growth then there is</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="4.77">no credit growth so the US economy is</text>
  <text start="977.22" dur="4.2">definitely not going to accelerate I</text>
  <text start="979.32" dur="3.93">think this is just all part of keeping</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="4.62">pressure off the dollar this</text>
  <text start="983.25" dur="5.82">quantitative easing has done nothing for</text>
  <text start="986.04" dur="5.88">the US economy except hurt it because it</text>
  <text start="989.07" dur="5.069">deprived everyone of interest income</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="4.289">this lack of interest income has caused</text>
  <text start="994.139" dur="4.471">a consumption of savings from the</text>
  <text start="996.209" dur="4.5">elderly this is very detrimental for the</text>
  <text start="998.61" dur="5.159">people and detrimental for their heirs</text>
  <text start="1000.709" dur="5.37">as well and what he&amp;#39;s saying is we are</text>
  <text start="1003.769" dur="5.07">heading down the path to a total</text>
  <text start="1006.079" dur="4.651">collapse it is not getting better people</text>

  <text start="1018.199" dur="5.25">not buying stuff in retail we can see</text>
  <text start="1020.899" dur="5.341">what is happening it is completely</text>
  <text start="1023.449" dur="6.841">falling apart and everyone needs to get</text>

  <text start="1599.38" dur="8.19">turning out well here and again the</text>
  <text start="1603.03" dur="5.41">United States and II you wanted the</text>

  <text start="2293.14" dur="5.73">video of recent meeting of a hundred</text>
  <text start="2295.12" dur="5.82">al-qaeda members in Yemen and we have to</text>
  <text start="2298.87" dur="4.35">remember the Yemen people are fighting</text>
  <text start="2300.94" dur="5.22">back you know those al-qaeda people who</text>
  <text start="2303.22" dur="4.53">are the actual people of Yemen who want</text>
  <text start="2306.16" dur="3.75">their country back but of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2307.75" dur="4.44">called terrorists and they&amp;#39;re having a</text>

  <text start="2312.19" dur="5.31">the government further and further in</text>
  <text start="2314.5" dur="4.32">their demands and getting uh and doing</text>
  <text start="2317.5" dur="3.36">the same thing that Libya&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="2318.82" dur="4.08">same thing in Iraq people are doing and</text>
  <text start="2320.86" dur="4.08">this goes on to say that including some</text>

  <text start="2340.24" dur="5.67">bearer of the cross is America the main</text>
  <text start="2343.3" dur="5.85">problem about this group is that it has</text>

  <text start="2359.53" dur="7.8">Rogers said so we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="2363.76" dur="5.19">being pushed for their agenda they need</text>
