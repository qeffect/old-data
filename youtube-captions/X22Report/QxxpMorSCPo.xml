  <text start="102.04" dur="7.04">he created an executive order which</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="5.82">eases the pain of the penalties on</text>
  <text start="109.08" dur="6.67">Americans with regards to Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="5.58">it looks like when you&amp;#39;re filling out</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="3.93">your taxes you really don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="2.94">answer that box if you have health</text>

  <text start="126.729" dur="4.14">looks like he did make it possible where</text>
  <text start="128.739" dur="5.071">people do not have to pay the penalty at</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="7.471">all at this point now we have the CEO of</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="7.35">Aetna Mark Bertolini he is out there and</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="6.84">he&amp;#39;s saying that there&amp;#39;s a problem with</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="6.57">Obamacare it is in a death spiral he</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="5.82">says the risk pools or deteriorating in</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="5.58">the Affordable Care Act to a point that</text>
  <text start="151" dur="5.07">it would inevitably result in more</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="3.929">withdrawals this year and he says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.07" dur="3">not going to get any better it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="157.239" dur="4.861">to get worse and this is why they need</text>
  <text start="159.07" dur="4.65">to get rid of Obamacare right now and we</text>
  <text start="162.1" dur="5.99">see right now you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="7.65">insurance industry created this bill</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.13">Obamacare because what they thought was</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="6">that if we can get everyone into this</text>
  <text start="174.22" dur="6.51">type of health insurance raise the</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="5.25">deductibles have high premiums put a</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="4.38">penalty in so people are</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="5.31">pushed into healthcare the system would</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="4.67">work great for the insurance agencies</text>
  <text start="187.93" dur="4.38">and what they&amp;#39;ve come to find is that</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.41">the people of the United States they</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="4.319">just can&amp;#39;t afford it this is this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="5.28">health sure health insurance for</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="5.791">everyone this was here we&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="3.989">monopoly and we&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="4.98">premiums and you can&amp;#39;t do anything about</text>
  <text start="204.459" dur="4.771">it no matter where you go you have to</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="5.04">take it and if you don&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="6.509">be charged anyhow and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="5.76">which we&amp;#39;ve been saying all along he</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="4.291">said let me say I&amp;#39;m going to pay this</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="3.539">much premium I&amp;#39;ve got a six thousand</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="3.989">dollar ductable and I&amp;#39;m going to go to</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="5.06">the doctor I&amp;#39;m going to pay cash so</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="5.64">premium plus deductible plus paying cash</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="6.101">why do I do this I&amp;#39;ll just pay the</text>
  <text start="229.659" dur="5.881">penalty and move on and this is what</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;ve been saying all along why would</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.35">people do this it makes no sense because</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.569">if you got out of the doctor guess what</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="5.159">you&amp;#39;ll just pay at the time that you go</text>
  <text start="241.629" dur="6.061">and this is what people were saying now</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="4.381">people who don&amp;#39;t have jobs or people who</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="4.229">are over that limit who are not getting</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="6.899">subsidized from the government it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.919" dur="6.12">help them it made it worse for them now</text>
  <text start="256.329" dur="4.171">we understand that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="258.039" dur="5.761">is out there and they are really bearing</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="5.639">down on the Trump administration and we</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="4.56">can see that it is very one-sided using</text>
  <text start="266.139" dur="5.491">a lot of propaganda to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="5.67">that Trump has relations with Russia</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="6.719">that he&amp;#39;s linked to Russia he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="7.109">receiving funds from Russia well we can</text>
  <text start="278.349" dur="5.641">see right now that there was a probe by</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="5.731">deutsche bank they were looking at his</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="6.48">accounts with hundreds of millions of US</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="8">dollars and they were looking for links</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="7.949">that indicated Russian involvement and</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="6.85">Deutsche Bank their internal review said</text>
  <text start="298.419" dur="6.861">we cannot find anything there is no such</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="9.12">link between Trump&amp;#39;s accounts and</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="8.53">Russian involvement so already that was</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.34">propaganda and we can see as we move</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="6.12">forward that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="6.72">putting out a lot of propaganda without</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.769">facts backing it up and this is where</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="5.1">the corporate media works this is why</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="5.31">this is how these agencies work they</text>
  <text start="328" dur="3.99">just want you to believe what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="6.451">saying but they don&amp;#39;t back anything up</text>
  <text start="331.99" dur="7.35">with facts now Bloomberg calmness Eli</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="4.709">Lake the former senior national security</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="3.12">correspondent for The Daily Beast who</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="2.611">covered national security and</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="5.1">intelligence for the Washington Times</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="6.9">the New York Sun and UPI said the</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="5.1">following that one White House official</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="4.38">with knowledge of the conversation told</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="4.68">me the Russian ambassador raised the</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="4.53">sanctions to Flynn and then Flynn</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="4.44">responded that Trump team will be taking</text>
  <text start="359.59" dur="5.91">office in a few weeks and we would</text>
  <text start="361.78" dur="6.12">review Russia policy and sanctions well</text>
  <text start="365.5" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s neither illegal nor improper that</text>
  <text start="367.9" dur="6.84">is the proper thing to say now if all</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="6.6">this is true then Flynn didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="5.79">anything and we&amp;#39;re getting word from a</text>
  <text start="376.84" dur="6.93">US until a few who&amp;#39;s saying that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="6.419">nothing criminal in Flynn&amp;#39;s phone call</text>
  <text start="383.77" dur="6.6">he listened to it and they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="386.949" dur="7.981">anything in other words this is all anti</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="7.2">Russia hysteria now jason Chaffetz he is</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="4.979">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that the House</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="4.86">Oversight Committee is going to be</text>
  <text start="399.909" dur="4.201">looking into this he says heads are</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="7.049">going to roll they&amp;#39;re going to look at</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="8.22">who is leaking this information now</text>
  <text start="409.479" dur="5.551">Larry Klayman the founder of freedom</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.29">watch is asking a federal court to hold</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="5.669">an emergency hearing on the National</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="8.13">Security Agency saying that the CIA is</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="5.761">spying on Donald Trump and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="4.44">see where all this goes but when we</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="5.22">listen to all of this we can see that</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="5.069">the corporate media the CIA the deep</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="4.919">state they&amp;#39;re pushing their soft coup</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="4.491">and they have to be very careful about</text>
  <text start="436.599" dur="6.6">this whole thing about the Logan act</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="6.7">because they might get others in trouble</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="4.231">with it because we need to go back in</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="4.6">time a little bit and just as a reminder</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="4.419">in over 200 years</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="7.049">not a single person has actually been</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="8.91">prosecuted under the logan act and we</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="5.491">know that the logan act says any citizen</text>
  <text start="460.759" dur="3.81">of the united states wherever he may be</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="3.78">who without authority of the United</text>
  <text start="464.569" dur="4.171">States directly or indirectly commences</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="3.72">or carries on any correspondence or</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="4.59">intercourse with any foreign government</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="5.97">or any officer or agent thereof with</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="5.28">intent to influence the measures or</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="6">conduct of any foreign government or any</text>
  <text start="478.61" dur="5.459">officer or agent Lee rough in relation</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="3.569">to any disputes or controversies with</text>
  <text start="484.069" dur="3.181">the United States or to defeat the</text>
  <text start="485.629" dur="4.051">measures of the United States shall be</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="6.21">fined under this title or in prison not</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="6.63">more than three years or both and when</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="7.079">we look back in time we can see that</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="6.69">obama and pelosi well they actually</text>
  <text start="500.539" dur="4.581">broke the logan act because in 2008</text>
  <text start="503" dur="6.36">while bush was in the White House</text>
  <text start="505.12" dur="7.87">senator Obama went to Iraq to in private</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="5.789">to persuade Iraqi officials to delay in</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="5.099">agreement on the drawdown of the</text>
  <text start="515.149" dur="6.211">American military presence until after</text>
  <text start="518.089" dur="6.901">the elections now Obama was not</text>
  <text start="521.36" dur="6.39">authorized by Bush to do this we see the</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="4.86">then house speaker nancy pelosi engaged</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="3.69">in similar activities that would seem to</text>
  <text start="529.85" dur="3.96">represent a much more obvious violation</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="6.69">of the logan act than anything flynn is</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="6.75">accused of in 2007 pelosi went to Israel</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="5.149">and Syria while in Damascus she</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="4.98">reportedly told Syrian dictator assad</text>
  <text start="543.279" dur="5.231">that Israel officials were ready for</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="4.919">peace talks now once again the US State</text>
  <text start="548.51" dur="3.449">Department came out and they blasted the</text>
  <text start="550.459" dur="4.141">entire visit saying it did not want</text>
  <text start="551.959" dur="6.151">Pelosi meddling in Syria or anywhere</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="6.66">else but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="5.31">all this the corporate media never</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="5.43">mentioned the Logan Act never really</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="6.479">brought it up never did anything didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="6.03">say it was a violation very hush-hush on</text>
  <text start="569.899" dur="5.041">the whole thing but we can see if</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re pushing this issue this might</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="7.17">turn up but the bigger question about</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="7.23">all of this is this</text>
  <text start="582.11" dur="6.81">Trump&amp;#39;s strategy did he come up with</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="5.039">this plan because Flynn knew he did</text>
  <text start="588.92" dur="7.159">nothing wrong Trump knew he did nothing</text>
  <text start="591.649" dur="6.87">wrong was this to flush out the leakers</text>
  <text start="596.079" dur="6.031">because think about it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="598.519" dur="7.801">difficult to fire these individuals it</text>
  <text start="602.11" dur="8.02">would be better to flush them out have</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="8.639">them leaked the information then have an</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="9">investigation to get rid of them to make</text>
  <text start="614.959" dur="7.56">the corporate media look bad now we will</text>
  <text start="619.13" dur="6.209">know this because if we start to see</text>
  <text start="622.519" dur="5.88">heads roll in the next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="625.339" dur="6.321">or months we know that this was his plan</text>
  <text start="628.399" dur="6.63">this was the strategy from the beginning</text>
  <text start="631.66" dur="6.549">now WikiLeaks they just released CIA</text>
  <text start="635.029" dur="5.55">documents detailing espionage orders to</text>

  <text start="646.64" dur="6.629">meaning no foreign eyes can view it well</text>
  <text start="650.209" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s obvious reasons why they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="653.269" dur="5.731">want any foreign eyes viewing it it</text>

  <text start="738.13" dur="6.63">to ensure they maintain influence over</text>
  <text start="740.5" dur="8.76">that inc outcome and what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="744.76" dur="9.12">from all of this is that the u.s. is not</text>
  <text start="749.26" dur="7.53">innocent the CIA has been manipulating</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="5.94">elections spying on foreign governments</text>
  <text start="756.79" dur="5.49">for quite a while and we know that the</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="4.83">deep state has been pushing regime</text>
  <text start="762.28" dur="4.32">change in many countries so for the</text>
  <text start="764.65" dur="4.11">United States to sit here and the</text>
  <text start="766.6" dur="4.35">corporate media to sit here to say how</text>
  <text start="768.76" dur="4.16">dare Russia get involved with the</text>
  <text start="770.95" dur="6.48">elections where there is no proof at all</text>
  <text start="772.92" dur="6.52">we see that the CIA the deep state the</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="4.77">agencies of the United States government</text>
  <text start="779.44" dur="5.76">they had been messing around with</text>
  <text start="782.2" dur="6.23">elections in other countries spying on</text>
  <text start="785.2" dur="8.01">Angela Merkel spying on the French</text>

  <text start="793.21" dur="6.84">in Lebanon in Iraq and then Syria which</text>
  <text start="797.92" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re still trying to do in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="800.05" dur="6.9">and many other countries so the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="803.74" dur="5.04">not innocent at all actually when you</text>
  <text start="806.95" dur="4.07">look at it it looks like the United</text>
  <text start="808.78" dur="7.08">States has done a lot more than Russia</text>
  <text start="811.02" dur="7.42">has done and right now there is</text>
  <text start="815.86" dur="5.76">absolutely no proof that Russia even</text>
  <text start="818.44" dur="4.98">hacked the elections or change the</text>
  <text start="821.62" dur="4.44">outcome in any way they cannot find any</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="6.33">proof whatsoever they&amp;#39;ve been searching</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="7.02">for proof they can&amp;#39;t find any now</text>
  <text start="829.75" dur="5.97">something very interesting in the German</text>
  <text start="833.08" dur="6.87">elections they are now pushing</text>
  <text start="835.72" dur="7.52">legislation a proposal I should say to</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="6.51">have migrants vote in the next election</text>
  <text start="843.24" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a 50-page concept proposes a</text>
  <text start="846.46" dur="3.95">series of reforms</text>
  <text start="848.16" dur="5.159">at making it easier for migrants from</text>
  <text start="850.41" dur="5.13">non-eu countries to settle in Germany as</text>
  <text start="853.319" dur="5.06">well as giving them access to the German</text>
  <text start="855.54" dur="4.919">labor market and political system and</text>
  <text start="858.379" dur="4.51">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="860.459" dur="4.23">is it&amp;#39;s very similar to what happened</text>
  <text start="862.889" dur="3.57">here in the United States where all of a</text>
  <text start="864.689" dur="3.061">sudden all these illegal immigrants were</text>
  <text start="866.459" dur="3.12">allowed to stay in the country if they</text>
  <text start="867.75" dur="5.04">jumped the border and they got working</text>
  <text start="869.579" dur="6.031">papers they were allowed to vote they</text>
  <text start="872.79" dur="6.27">could do all that stuff which is very</text>
  <text start="875.61" dur="6.12">interesting and we have to look at the</text>
  <text start="879.06" dur="5.55">reason why there was a poll done by</text>
  <text start="881.73" dur="6.419">yougov and it shows that sixty four</text>
  <text start="884.61" dur="6.089">percent of Germans want a new chancellor</text>
  <text start="888.149" dur="5.701">now we know that angular Merkel she is</text>
  <text start="890.699" dur="5.101">looking at the polls she seen had the</text>
  <text start="893.85" dur="4.32">people well they don&amp;#39;t want her anymore</text>
  <text start="895.8" dur="4.909">this is why she&amp;#39;s coming down hard on</text>
  <text start="898.17" dur="5.729">fake news this is why she&amp;#39;s blocking</text>
  <text start="900.709" dur="4.81">stories that have the opposite view of</text>
  <text start="903.899" dur="4.141">what she is trying to push out there</text>
  <text start="905.519" dur="4.651">this is why they want migrants to vote</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="3.87">because hey it&amp;#39;s Angela Merkel who let</text>
  <text start="910.17" dur="4.339">you into the country how are you going</text>
  <text start="911.91" dur="4.83">to vote and we can see a lot of</text>
  <text start="914.509" dur="4.601">similarities of what they&amp;#39;re proposing</text>
  <text start="916.74" dur="5.339">and what is happening here in the United</text>
  <text start="919.11" dur="5.57">States because these leaders understand</text>
  <text start="922.079" dur="5.43">that they&amp;#39;re not going to be reelected</text>
  <text start="924.68" dur="5.74">we see it in France we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="927.509" dur="5.58">Italy we&amp;#39;re seeing in Germany things are</text>
  <text start="930.42" dur="5.43">changing and the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="933.089" dur="4.74">globus they don&amp;#39;t like it remember they</text>
  <text start="935.85" dur="5.94">like to keep their power they will do</text>
  <text start="937.829" dur="7.32">anything to keep their power they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="941.79" dur="5.31">like change like this this is why we can</text>
  <text start="945.149" dur="4.62">see the corporate media the deep state</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="4.229">pushing a soft coup in the United States</text>
  <text start="949.769" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="951.329" dur="6.93">to regain control now we understand that</text>
  <text start="956.279" dur="3.93">the central bankers of deep state they</text>
  <text start="958.259" dur="4.05">want to get us into war and something</text>
  <text start="960.209" dur="5.82">very interesting as we know we discussed</text>
  <text start="962.309" dur="5.25">it before where we had kim jeongnam he</text>
  <text start="966.029" dur="2.881">was murdered now there are many</text>
  <text start="967.559" dur="3.931">different stories going around they</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="4.5">arrested two women they say that they</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.019">sprayed something on him another report</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="3.659">that it was a needle and they keep</text>
  <text start="975.509" dur="5.88">saying yes it&amp;#39;s North Korea it&amp;#39;s North</text>
  <text start="977.069" dur="5.281">Korea and there was a hit put out on kim</text>
  <text start="981.389" dur="4.621">jungnam</text>
  <text start="982.35" dur="7.32">five years so five years ago they put</text>
  <text start="986.01" dur="6.9">out this order and we can see that kim</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="5.97">jungnam well he traveled freely he went</text>
  <text start="992.91" dur="4.8">to many different countries it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="995.64" dur="4.44">like he was hiding he was under guard or</text>
  <text start="997.71" dur="5.55">anything like that so over the five</text>
  <text start="1000.08" dur="6.3">years they waited for this point in time</text>
  <text start="1003.26" dur="5.73">to assassinate him something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1006.38" dur="4.8">sound right now a defector who was a</text>
  <text start="1008.99" dur="4.95">senior official in the North said it is</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="5.79">hard to believe that it took agent five</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="5.64">years to execute in order he says</text>
  <text start="1016.97" dur="5.25">something else happened and it he</text>
  <text start="1019.58" dur="6.33">doesn&amp;#39;t believe that the North actually</text>
  <text start="1022.22" dur="8.25">put the hit out on kim jungnam who&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="1025.91" dur="8.96">half brother of King Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1030.47" dur="8.16">most likely this was wet work by the CIA</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="6.91">where they took him out trying to create</text>
  <text start="1038.63" dur="5.49">an incident and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1041.78" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re looking toward the north south</text>
  <text start="1044.12" dur="4.92">korea saying this they have intel saying</text>
  <text start="1046.94" dur="4.41">it definitely was the north south korea</text>
  <text start="1049.04" dur="4.2">OSS as the north and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1051.35" dur="4.47">now they&amp;#39;re trying to build this case</text>
  <text start="1053.24" dur="5.64">and they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke the north</text>
  <text start="1055.82" dur="6.39">once again and it seems like this most</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="7.32">likely was their plan now out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1062.21" dur="6.33">we see Ukraine just accused Russia in</text>
  <text start="1066.2" dur="4.53">hacking their power grid their financial</text>
  <text start="1068.54" dur="5.07">system and other infrastructure with a</text>
  <text start="1070.73" dur="5.25">new type of virus and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1073.61" dur="4.53">now we know that Graham and McCain they</text>
  <text start="1075.98" dur="4.14">were out in Ukraine speaking to</text>
  <text start="1078.14" dur="3.42">poroshenko saying this is the year of</text>
  <text start="1080.12" dur="3.75">the offensive and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1081.56" dur="4.14">war broke out in this area and it</text>
  <text start="1083.87" dur="4.02">started to heat up and now we see that</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="5.4">poroshenko is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="1087.89" dur="4.65">blaming Russia for cyber attacks and of</text>
  <text start="1091.1" dur="3.87">course this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="1092.54" dur="5.19">propaganda to try to draw Russia in</text>
  <text start="1094.97" dur="5.31">remember the neocons the deep state the</text>
  <text start="1097.73" dur="6.18">elite central bankers they want a war</text>
  <text start="1100.28" dur="6.65">with Russia and they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="1103.91" dur="6.03">this story now Putin is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1106.93" dur="5.92">Kiev is not ready for any type of</text>
  <text start="1109.94" dur="5.58">peaceful conflict all they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1112.85" dur="3.21">do is start a war they don&amp;#39;t even want</text>
  <text start="1115.52" dur="3.06">to abide</text>
  <text start="1116.06" dur="4.62">other means to agreement and we can see</text>
  <text start="1118.58" dur="5.73">at this point that it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="1120.68" dur="5.07">difficult to deal with them and we can</text>
  <text start="1124.31" dur="3.66">see right now that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1125.75" dur="4.5">is making a very big deal about the spy</text>
  <text start="1127.97" dur="4.53">ship that is off the coast and they keep</text>
  <text start="1130.25" dur="6.78">broadcasting it but we have to</text>
  <text start="1132.5" dur="7.53">understand something that&amp;#39;s a fact the</text>
  <text start="1137.03" dur="6.93">spy ship which is really an intelligence</text>
  <text start="1140.03" dur="6.24">collection ship is perfectly perfectly</text>
  <text start="1143.96" dur="6.06">marked so everyone knows what it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1146.27" dur="7.83">in international waters and what they</text>
  <text start="1150.02" dur="7.11">always forget to do is take what the</text>
  <text start="1154.1" dur="5.79">Pentagon said the Pentagon came out and</text>
  <text start="1157.13" dur="5.72">said so long as the spy ship is</text>
  <text start="1159.89" dur="6.27">operating in international waters as</text>
  <text start="1162.85" dur="5.62">frankly we do around the world and are</text>
  <text start="1166.16" dur="4.17">behaving in a responsible way they are</text>
  <text start="1168.47" dur="3.87">certainly free to do so and it does not</text>
  <text start="1170.33" dur="4.08">cause any alarm within this building</text>
  <text start="1172.34" dur="6.72">this is coming from the press secretary</text>
  <text start="1174.41" dur="7.26">Geoff Morrell so we can see already they</text>
  <text start="1179.06" dur="4.98">already know that this is not a problem</text>
  <text start="1181.67" dur="4.83">but the corporate media is building this</text>
  <text start="1184.04" dur="5.79">up now we also had the report that</text>
  <text start="1186.5" dur="5.28">Russian Jets while they buzzed the USS</text>
  <text start="1189.83" dur="4.02">Porter and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1191.78" dur="4.29">this that the u.s. navy they released a</text>
  <text start="1193.85" dur="6.15">picture of the porter casting law from</text>
  <text start="1196.07" dur="5.58">its birth in romania on februari 8th US</text>
  <text start="1200" dur="4.26">records reveal a gap between the porter</text>
  <text start="1201.65" dur="5.16">leaving romania and passing through the</text>
  <text start="1204.26" dur="4.74">Bosphorus and out of the black sea on</text>
  <text start="1206.81" dur="4.2">februari 11th now the distance between</text>
  <text start="1209" dur="5.01">the two is a hundred ninety seven</text>
  <text start="1211.01" dur="5.64">nautical miles the porters top rated</text>
  <text start="1214.01" dur="4.53">speed is more than 30 knots but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1216.65" dur="3.93">cruising speed is around 20 knots at</text>
  <text start="1218.54" dur="5.37">that rate it would have taken eight</text>
  <text start="1220.58" dur="7.41">hours to sail from the port in Romania</text>
  <text start="1223.91" dur="7.62">to the Bosphorus in fact the vessel took</text>
  <text start="1227.99" dur="5.61">three days in other words the porter was</text>
  <text start="1231.53" dur="5.82">failing either north towards the Russian</text>
  <text start="1233.6" dur="7.59">naval base at Sevastopol Crimea or east</text>
  <text start="1237.35" dur="6.24">towards the Russian mainland now the</text>
  <text start="1241.19" dur="6.24">question is where was the USS Porter</text>
  <text start="1243.59" dur="5.73">during this period of time because it</text>
  <text start="1247.43" dur="5.339">took some</text>
  <text start="1249.32" dur="6.569">in like four days or so for anyone to</text>
  <text start="1252.769" dur="7.081">even mention that Russia flew by the</text>
  <text start="1255.889" dur="6.87">ship now if they sailed male sailed near</text>
  <text start="1259.85" dur="5.85">Crimea or sailed NER near the Russian</text>
  <text start="1262.759" dur="5.221">mainland well Russian Jets would have</text>
  <text start="1265.7" dur="5.01">flown by to see what is this ship doing</text>
  <text start="1267.98" dur="6.99">here it goes on the morning of februari</text>
  <text start="1270.71" dur="7.349">15th the London Daily Mail put out a</text>
  <text start="1274.97" dur="7.38">headline Russia test the waters military</text>
  <text start="1278.059" dur="7.681">jets buzz a US destroyer and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1282.35" dur="6.09">seeing right now is that once again the</text>
  <text start="1285.74" dur="6.419">porter was missing during this period</text>
  <text start="1288.44" dur="5.31">where did it go because they have a</text>
  <text start="1292.159" dur="3.99">record of when it passed through the</text>
  <text start="1293.75" dur="4.59">Bosphorus and they have a record of when</text>
  <text start="1296.149" dur="5.52">it left the port but they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1298.34" dur="5.24">where it went during this period and we</text>
  <text start="1301.669" dur="5.551">can see right now unless russia says hey</text>
  <text start="1303.58" dur="6.339">the USS porter was near crimea it was</text>
  <text start="1307.22" dur="5.309">near the Russian mainland that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="1309.919" dur="5.46">flew by and most likely that is going to</text>
  <text start="1312.529" dur="4.53">be the story we see you as troops</text>
  <text start="1315.379" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re bringing in the ground vehicles</text>
  <text start="1317.059" dur="4.141">and they&amp;#39;re deploying them to Bulgaria</text>
  <text start="1318.83" dur="4.229">right now and we can see that the United</text>
  <text start="1321.2" dur="4.559">States they&amp;#39;re moving military assets</text>
  <text start="1323.059" dur="4.98">and troops all around Russia right now</text>
  <text start="1325.759" dur="5.28">and this has been going on for quite a</text>
  <text start="1328.039" dur="4.441">while this is nothing new the United</text>
  <text start="1331.039" dur="5.61">States government central bankers if you</text>
  <text start="1332.48" dur="6.21">go back to 2012 2013 2014 they have been</text>
  <text start="1336.649" dur="5.25">moving military assets more and more and</text>
  <text start="1338.69" dur="5.219">more of them into and around Russia and</text>
  <text start="1341.899" dur="4.11">encircling China because this has been</text>
  <text start="1343.909" dur="5.191">their planned from the beginning now out</text>
  <text start="1346.009" dur="6.201">in Libya we see that NATO has received a</text>
  <text start="1349.1" dur="5.4">formal request from the un-backed</text>
  <text start="1352.21" dur="4.809">government because we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1354.5" dur="5.659">general huffed are made a request to</text>
  <text start="1357.019" dur="6.061">Russia now NATO is getting involved</text>
  <text start="1360.159" dur="4.9">because the Libyan National Army well</text>
  <text start="1363.08" dur="4.589">it&amp;#39;s not under the control of the UN</text>
  <text start="1365.059" dur="5.25">back government and it looks like NATO</text>
  <text start="1367.669" dur="5.37">is going to help Libya with their</text>
  <text start="1370.309" dur="5.641">expertise and advice in establishment of</text>
  <text start="1373.039" dur="4.86">defense and security in this area so we</text>
  <text start="1375.95" dur="4.859">can see NATO is getting involved in</text>
  <text start="1377.899" dur="4.781">Libya because right now Trump well he&amp;#39;s</text>
