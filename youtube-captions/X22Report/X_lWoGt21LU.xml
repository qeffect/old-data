  <text start="53.56" dur="5.34">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="56.95" dur="6.15">x22 report my name is dave Andrews</text>
  <text start="58.9" dur="7.17">episode 1341 bien today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="63.1" dur="5.4">25th 2017 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="66.07" dur="5.64">is a strategic move by Russia has just</text>
  <text start="68.5" dur="5.19">been played check let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.71" dur="4.35">economic collapse political NGO</text>
  <text start="73.69" dur="4.23">political news now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="76.06" dur="4.53">feud between Trump and sessions is</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="5.01">continuing and we&amp;#39;re seeing that Trump</text>
  <text start="80.59" dur="5.07">he is just unleashing a tweet storm and</text>
  <text start="82.93" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s lashing out at the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="85.66" dur="4.709">and one of the things he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="87.61" dur="4.86">that the Attorney General Jeff session</text>
  <text start="90.369" dur="5.131">he&amp;#39;s taken a very weak position on</text>
  <text start="92.47" dur="5.85">Hillary Clinton crimes and Intel leakers</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="5.43">and I have to agree with him I mean he</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="5.22">should be investigating all these things</text>
  <text start="100.93" dur="6.39">about the email about what was going on</text>
  <text start="103.54" dur="6.63">and he should also be looking in to the</text>
  <text start="107.32" dur="4.83">leaks and the unmasking and everything</text>
  <text start="110.17" dur="4.8">because these things are completely</text>
  <text start="112.15" dur="4.41">against the law and there was a crime</text>
  <text start="114.97" dur="3.42">that was committed but it looks like</text>
  <text start="116.56" dur="3.869">he&amp;#39;s doing none of this you should be</text>
  <text start="118.39" dur="4.74">also looking into the training efforts</text>
  <text start="120.429" dur="5.61">to sabotage the election because as we</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="7.14">know Clinton was maybe colluding with</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="6.961">the Ukrainian government to basically</text>
  <text start="130.27" dur="3.81">set up Trump this also should be</text>
  <text start="133" dur="3.12">investigated because if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="3.75">investigating the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="6.24">where there&amp;#39;s no evidence they should do</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="6.06">the same with Ukraine but once again the</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="3.54">deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this the</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="4.23">corporate media once again is the</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="4.41">mouthpiece of the deep state so we know</text>
  <text start="148.12" dur="5.43">exactly what is going he also tweeted</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="6">about the acting director Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="5.25">who he accused of corruption and</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="6.27">remember he received 700,000 from</text>
  <text start="158.8" dur="8.01">Hillary for his wife when his wife was</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="6.36">running for office so we see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="4.47">many different things happening here and</text>
  <text start="168.94" dur="4.23">at this point Trump looks like he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="3.9">calling out all these individuals</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s also rumors that killer sin</text>
  <text start="175.18" dur="4.23">might be quitting now CNN is putting</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="5.19">this out and again once again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.41" dur="6.299">pushing this propaganda trying to make</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.59">it seem like trump&amp;#39;s administration is</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="3.571">in complete chaos</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="5.039">what I think Trump should do at this</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="5.31">point and I think Todd it&amp;#39;s now time to</text>
  <text start="192.159" dur="4.351">do this just like he fired Comey it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="3.78">time to get rid of Tillerson it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="4.619">to get rid of sessions it&amp;#39;s time to get</text>
  <text start="198.37" dur="4.83">rid of all these individuals and bring</text>
  <text start="201.129" dur="4.741">in the people that he wants I think when</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="4.259">he became president remember Republicans</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="3.509">they really don&amp;#39;t like him they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="4.081">sticking up for him Democrats completely</text>
  <text start="209.379" dur="4.14">hate him the deep state can&amp;#39;t stand them</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="5.61">the intelligence agencies they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.519" dur="6.271">like them I think it&amp;#39;s time to bring in</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="5.22">the people that he wants who cares about</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.229">Republican who cares about Democrat who</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="3.959">cares about the intelligent agencies</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="6.201">bring in people that are going to work</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="7.861">for the people not for these</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="5.92">organizations not for lobbyists not for</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="4.65">all of these things now if he could do</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="5.819">this this would be something we see that</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="5.13">CIA director John Brennan and we see</text>
  <text start="241.959" dur="4.14">clapper they&amp;#39;re both out there saying</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="5.04">listen if Trump tries to fire Mueller</text>
  <text start="246.099" dur="6.211">well we should have some type of coup</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="4.74">and get rid of Trump now they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="3.09">trying to do this and you can see this</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="4.44">is their real intention their real</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="5.489">intention is trying to get rid of Trump</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="5.849">that&amp;#39;s their main focus and it has been</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="4.59">like this for a very long time we see</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="3.241">that the Korver media was out there</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="4.44">trying to say that yes Trump&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="4.259">into parting himself and once again I</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="3.12">think this is complete propaganda I</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s going to pardon himself</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="4.861">and even if he did it would be a</text>
  <text start="275.349" dur="4.111">complete disaster on his part and I</text>
  <text start="277.9" dur="4.26">think the corporate media was playing</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="3.989">that up quite a bit maybe they looked</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="2.58">into it to see if there was a</text>
  <text start="283.449" dur="3.601">possibility but I don&amp;#39;t think he would</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="5.73">ever do it because once again if he</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.489">fires Mueller if he fires anyone else it</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.1">would look very suspicious at this point</text>
  <text start="292.539" dur="4.621">and we can see that Al Green who filed</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="4.2">the impeachment papers</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s also also creating a bill to</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="3.99">prevent Trump from pardoning himself now</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="5.13">remember a lot of these government</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="5.219">idiots they get their information from</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.62">the deep State now what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="5.011">is they read the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="3.9">they believe everything that is being</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="3.39">said there I mean when you were</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="3.48">listening to these Senate panels and</text>
  <text start="317.38" dur="2.96">they were questioning Comey they were</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="3.62">questioning</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="4.05">sessions they were reading from the</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="4.08">corporate media like this was the</text>
  <text start="324.39" dur="4.38">absolute truth I mean if you listen to</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="3.75">Feinstein she was reading from you know</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="4.86">the Washington Post or The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="330.57" dur="5.55">Journal she was reading from these you</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="4.92">know papers or the New York Times like</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="5.07">yes this is the real story instead of</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="6.03">investigating and going past this and</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="5.01">looking into this themselves but once</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="4.47">again we can see many of these</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="6.59">individuals are part of the deep state</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="6.5">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="352.79" dur="4.87">maybe back in April we talked about</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="5.61">microchipping employees we talked about</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="6.9">this Swedish company epicenter that was</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="5.92">implanting their people with RFID chips</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="4.56">if we go back even further we talked</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="4.17">about the plan of the deep state the</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="3.54">central bankers to everyone have</text>
  <text start="371.25" dur="3.9">everyone chipped and everyone said no</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="5.04">this is ridiculous this is not going to</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="5.13">happen this is one of those conspiracy</text>
  <text start="377.7" dur="4.17">theories but yes when we discussed it</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.29">back in April a Swedish company</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="6.06">epicenter they did implant their</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="5.81">employees with RFID chips now these RFID</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.34">chips they&amp;#39;re very small - like a small</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="4.57">piece of rice and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="4.29">implant it right under the skin it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="4.98">electronic device and you can use it to</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="4.17">gain access to doorways you can use it</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="3.93">to pay you can use it for many different</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="5.61">things they&amp;#39;d also be used for tracking</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.79">now when these employees in the Swedish</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="6">company receive the RFID chip they have</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="5.82">parties they congratulate the individual</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="4.44">getting it they say yes you&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="4.44">the group now and they&amp;#39;re able to go</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="3.75">shopping with it they&amp;#39;re big they can</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="4.2">use their money with it they can open</text>
  <text start="421.53" dur="4.53">doors and have access to certain parts</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="4.62">of the company and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="5.67">that well this is starting to spread now</text>
  <text start="428.73" dur="5.25">a Wisconsin company yes you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="431.73" dur="4.62">United States is about to become the</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="6.81">first in the u.s. to offer microchip</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="5.88">implants to its employees and of course</text>
  <text start="440.79" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re saying this is the next big</text>
  <text start="442.23" dur="4.47">thing and it&amp;#39;s going to happen to</text>
  <text start="444.57" dur="4.17">everyone and we want to be a part of it</text>
  <text start="446.7" dur="5.63">this is coming from three square market</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="4.68">chief executive officer Todd Westby now</text>
  <text start="452.33" dur="2.95">what</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these individuals</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="7.74">about 50 of them have already received</text>
  <text start="458.22" dur="7.23">the implant and they are using it and we</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="5.34">can see that once again they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="465.45" dur="6.06">that this is a fantastic thing they</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t have to use cash they can use this</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="5.13">chip for many other different things it</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="5.76">has all your identification paperwork on</text>
  <text start="476.64" dur="4.26">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that yes this</text>
  <text start="479.64" dur="4.23">should spread throughout the country</text>
  <text start="480.9" dur="6.09">throughout the world and we have said</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.53">this before this is the main goal of the</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.14">deep State the central bank they want</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="5.25">everyone shipped they want to control</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="4.71">track and they want to make sure that</text>
  <text start="493.65" dur="6.99">they know exactly what you&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="7.71">once they do this guess what well at</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="7.26">this point there&amp;#39;s going to be no paper</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="6.81">money there&amp;#39;s going to be no papers you</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="4.2">can be turned off or turned on and what</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="4.11">I mean by that is your bank account they</text>
  <text start="512.1" dur="2.879">can track all your purchases where have</text>
  <text start="514.47" dur="1.98">you been</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="3.571">because think about it they can set up</text>
  <text start="516.45" dur="4.47">sensors in every part of the city or</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="3.69">everywhere you go and all that has to do</text>
  <text start="520.92" dur="4.14">is register that you just walk by</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="4.8">something without you even knowing it</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="4.83">you can&amp;#39;t turn it on you can&amp;#39;t turn it</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="5.16">off they can update the software within</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="4.29">the RFID chip automatically to have</text>
  <text start="532.2" dur="3.21">whatever they want and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="2.7">saying well no it&amp;#39;s not going to be used</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="3.12">for tracking it&amp;#39;s going to be encrypted</text>
  <text start="536.88" dur="4.71">you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it and of</text>
  <text start="538.53" dur="5.73">course you know how well this worked out</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="5.37">with cell phones where they implanted</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="4.86">the software without anyone knowing and</text>
  <text start="546.96" dur="3.9">they have the ability to track they have</text>
  <text start="549.12" dur="4.53">the ability to do whatever they want the</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="5.79">difference now is that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="5.94">within you you you really unless you you</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="7.17">know dig it out it&amp;#39;s always with you and</text>
  <text start="559.59" dur="6.39">you cannot really remove it because you</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="5.49">will not be able to do anything without</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="4.16">it so they&amp;#39;re already making the push to</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.77">do this</text>
  <text start="570.14" dur="5.83">now out in Venezuela we see Maduro he is</text>
  <text start="574.08" dur="4.11">racing against time he wants a new</text>
  <text start="575.97" dur="5.7">constitution and we see the deep state</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="7.68">they are pushing very very hard to try</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="5.659">to overthrow this government and Maduro</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="3.319">he&amp;#39;s out there saying that</text>
  <text start="587.329" dur="4.23">he will have the vote and it will be</text>
  <text start="589.189" dur="4.231">held next week in defiance of all the</text>
  <text start="591.559" dur="4.71">threats from US sanctions in the deep</text>
  <text start="593.42" dur="5.55">state and they&amp;#39;re going to vote on his</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="4.92">ability to basically redraft the country</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="4.14">Constitution this way it will give him</text>
  <text start="601.189" dur="4.531">more power it will be able to fight</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="5.939">against the deep state and it will allow</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="5.7">him more power to do this now is this a</text>
  <text start="609.049" dur="4.53">good thing is this a bad thing one thing</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="4.44">that we do know is that the deep state</text>
  <text start="613.579" dur="4.92">they want control of Venezuela they have</text>
  <text start="615.86" dur="4.649">a lot of oil they need it to prop up</text>
  <text start="618.499" dur="4.171">this system remember the deep state they</text>
  <text start="620.509" dur="4.411">haven&amp;#39;t given up even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.67" dur="5.669">being dismantled in all different parts</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="6.659">their goal is still to have control of</text>
  <text start="628.339" dur="5.641">the world they&amp;#39;re there their goal is</text>
  <text start="631.579" dur="5.67">still to have regime change they have</text>
  <text start="633.98" dur="5.609">not stopped this as of yet now out in</text>

  <text start="639.589" dur="5.34">Andre vicek he visited the Philippines</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="3.509">to see what was really going on there</text>

  <text start="652.129" dur="4.14">there and said well all these reports</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="4.829">coming from the Western media well</text>
  <text start="656.269" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re not exactly true he&amp;#39;s saying</text>

  <text start="675.259" dur="5.55">reaction when he visited the Philippines</text>
  <text start="676.809" dur="6.22">was one of shock and outrage he said</text>
  <text start="680.809" dur="4.65">what I witnessed was a fundamentally</text>
  <text start="683.029" dur="4.441">different from what has repeatedly been</text>
  <text start="685.459" dur="5.761">said by most of the western mass media</text>
  <text start="687.47" dur="6.359">outlets it is evident right from the</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="5.279">start that Marawi is not totally</text>

  <text start="696.499" dur="6.15">saying that it&amp;#39;s devastating the entire</text>
  <text start="699.439" dur="4.921">area is completely destroyed he says</text>
  <text start="702.649" dur="3.87">most of its standing and standing firm I</text>
  <text start="704.36" dur="3.509">said I would estimate that only about</text>
  <text start="706.519" dur="3.961">twenty to thirty percent of the houses</text>
  <text start="707.869" dur="5.28">and buildings they have sustained heavy</text>
  <text start="710.48" dur="6.389">damage but the rest of the area is</text>
  <text start="713.149" dur="6.24">pretty darn good and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="716.869" dur="4.211">there&amp;#39;s around 400,000 to 500,000</text>

  <text start="726.69" dur="6.48">so people and there is no indiscriminate</text>
  <text start="730.71" dur="5.22">bombing of civilians that is completely</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="5.1">fake phony and false the saying that all</text>
  <text start="735.93" dur="5.61">targets are mostly precise they&amp;#39;re aimed</text>
  <text start="738.27" dur="5.64">at the terrorists only mosques and other</text>
  <text start="741.54" dur="7.31">building houses they are still standing</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="7.98">and we can see that the people they are</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="5.89">supporting the president now everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.89" dur="3.81">talking about martial law and how you</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="2.85">know the government is going to be</text>
  <text start="755.7" dur="4.68">coming down on the people if they</text>
  <text start="757.59" dur="5.46">violate the curfew with martial law but</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s saying this is not true once again</text>
  <text start="763.05" dur="6.54">with martial law in this area there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.66" dur="7.8">been no brutal consequences if you are</text>
  <text start="769.59" dur="6.36">outside of the curfew they just tell you</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="4.62">listen you shouldn&amp;#39;t be outside nothing</text>
  <text start="775.95" dur="4.74">really happens they only put it into</text>
  <text start="778.08" dur="4.62">place to make sure that everyone clears</text>
  <text start="780.69" dur="4.86">the street because there&amp;#39;s battles going</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="4.47">on within the country and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="785.55" dur="3.87">that the difference between this martial</text>
  <text start="787.17" dur="4.26">laws this martial law and those that</text>
  <text start="789.42" dur="4.83">were imposed during the reign of Fernand</text>
  <text start="791.43" dur="4.65">Marcos is that now the military is</text>
  <text start="794.25" dur="4.35">mainly doing real fighting while</text>
  <text start="796.08" dur="5.73">providing assistance to the civilians</text>
  <text start="798.6" dur="5.22">and the people that belong to the</text>
  <text start="801.81" dur="4.44">Islamic state are not only terrorists</text>
  <text start="803.82" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re also criminals they&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="806.25" dur="4.29">in drugs they&amp;#39;re dealing in human</text>
  <text start="807.87" dur="5.73">trafficking and again this is all part</text>
  <text start="810.54" dur="5.91">of the West where they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="6.09">their agenda in the Philippines now he</text>
  <text start="816.45" dur="5.7">spoke to a lot of the people within this</text>
  <text start="819.69" dur="5.82">area and most of the people say listen</text>
  <text start="822.15" dur="5.55">the West is constantly criticizing about</text>
  <text start="825.51" dur="3.66">what you know the entire situation here</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="3.87">and we see all the news reports coming</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="4.68">out but they haven&amp;#39;t sent any help</text>
  <text start="831.57" dur="3.93">whatsoever they have sent no assistance</text>
  <text start="833.85" dur="5.58">whatsoever all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="7.62">criticizing all the help is coming from</text>
  <text start="839.43" dur="6">the do-dirty government he is sending in</text>
  <text start="843.12" dur="4.89">supplies for the people he&amp;#39;s helping the</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="5.25">people and the Western countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.01" dur="5.13">doing absolutely nothing because this is</text>
  <text start="850.68" dur="3.84">not part of their agenda their agenda is</text>
  <text start="853.14" dur="3">to take control</text>
  <text start="854.52" dur="3.39">of the Philippines just like their</text>
  <text start="856.14" dur="5.27">agendas take control of Libya</text>
  <text start="857.91" dur="6.12">control to take control of Iraq Syria</text>
  <text start="861.41" dur="4.57">Yemen and if they&amp;#39;re trying to take</text>
  <text start="864.03" dur="4.98">control they&amp;#39;re not going to bring in</text>
  <text start="865.98" dur="5.94">support for those people now it looks</text>
  <text start="869.01" dur="5.16">like Trump at this point is not sending</text>
  <text start="871.92" dur="4.62">troops into Afghanistan McMaster has</text>
  <text start="874.17" dur="4.59">brought him a plan and it looks like</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="3.24">Trump rejected the plan to send more</text>
  <text start="878.76" dur="2.4">troops in there</text>
  <text start="879.78" dur="3.9">they were talk that you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.16" dur="4.68">going to be a cap of about 3900 soldiers</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="3.78">moving into Afghanistan and Trump did</text>
  <text start="885.84" dur="4.92">say something very interesting listen</text>
  <text start="887.46" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ve been in Afghanistan for 17 years</text>
  <text start="890.76" dur="6.03">and he said I want to find out what</text>
  <text start="893.46" dur="6.29">we&amp;#39;ve been doing in Afghanistan for the</text>
  <text start="896.79" dur="5.4">last 17 years I think he already</text>
  <text start="899.75" dur="5.5">understands and already knows what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="902.19" dur="6.06">been doing in Afghanistan protecting the</text>
  <text start="905.25" dur="4.77">poppy fields controlling the government</text>
  <text start="908.25" dur="4.65">making sure there&amp;#39;s an Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="7.55">government that is loyal to the deep</text>
  <text start="912.9" dur="7.02">state keeping China and Russia in check</text>
  <text start="917.57" dur="4.6">controlling the natural resources in</text>
  <text start="919.92" dur="4.95">Afghanistan I think we know what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="922.17" dur="5.58">going on there now we see another</text>
  <text start="924.87" dur="5.25">incident yesterday we had a US spy plane</text>
  <text start="927.75" dur="5.49">that had taken a Savannah because a</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="5.19">Chinese jet or two Chinese jets flew</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="4.44">close to it but not as close as the s6</text>
  <text start="935.31" dur="5.28">teams when they flew very close to the</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="6.63">runner Russian defense minister in his</text>
  <text start="940.59" dur="5.01">jet flying back to Russia but you know</text>
  <text start="944.31" dur="3.39">of course the corporate media is blowing</text>
  <text start="945.6" dur="7.65">this out of proportion now we get word</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="6.93">that this Iranian vessel and you we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="953.25" dur="3.96">seen these Iranian vessels before</text>
  <text start="954.63" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re these little tiny boats they</text>
  <text start="957.21" dur="6.47">approached a US Navy patrol ship the US</text>
  <text start="961.2" dur="5.61">Navy patrol ship fired warning shots</text>
  <text start="963.68" dur="5.44">toward the Iranian vessel near the</text>
  <text start="966.81" dur="5.85">northern Arabian Gulf now of course the</text>
  <text start="969.12" dur="5.46">u.s. is very close to the waters of Iran</text>
  <text start="972.66" dur="4.11">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this little</text>
  <text start="974.58" dur="5.94">tunnel vet this little tiny vessel came</text>
  <text start="976.77" dur="7.8">within a hundred and fifty yards of the</text>
  <text start="980.52" dur="6.9">u.s. ship now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="984.57" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re really worried about this little</text>
  <text start="987.42" dur="5.04">tiny</text>
  <text start="988.85" dur="7.51">tugboat this little raft because you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="992.46" dur="8.4">seen them they&amp;#39;re tiny and they really</text>
  <text start="996.36" dur="6.63">had a fire shot to ward it off I mean</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="6.66">this just sounds absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="6.6">because the u.s. ship was right outside</text>
  <text start="1007.52" dur="5.31">and I&amp;#39;m sure they were heading towards</text>
  <text start="1009.59" dur="5.51">the Iranian waters probably at high</text>
  <text start="1012.83" dur="4.92">speed like they normally do to provoke</text>
  <text start="1015.1" dur="5.44">something out of Iran to make this an</text>
  <text start="1017.75" dur="4.71">incredible story and of course the</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="3.45">officials are saying that the Iranian</text>
  <text start="1022.46" dur="4.32">vessel appeared to be from the Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1023.99" dur="6.62">Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps so</text>
  <text start="1026.78" dur="8.1">once again we&amp;#39;re seeing provocation</text>
  <text start="1030.61" dur="6.339">we&amp;#39;re seeing the deep state push their</text>
  <text start="1034.88" dur="4.199">agenda in all different areas because</text>
  <text start="1036.949" dur="5.01">they want these countries to do</text>
  <text start="1039.079" dur="5.551">something and we can see these countries</text>
  <text start="1041.959" dur="4.681">are restraining and they&amp;#39;re holding back</text>
  <text start="1044.63" dur="3.93">and saying you know something we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1046.64" dur="4.08">going to do anything because we know</text>
  <text start="1048.56" dur="4.65">what you want us to do and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1050.72" dur="4.95">going to do it we see the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1053.21" dur="3.9">democratic forces they&amp;#39;re using armed</text>
  <text start="1055.67" dur="3.42">drones where did they get these armed</text>

  <text start="1065.12" dur="3.75">state provided them with these drones</text>
  <text start="1067.25" dur="3.63">now all they&amp;#39;re doing is saying listen</text>
  <text start="1068.87" dur="3.6">the terrorist groups are done we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1070.88" dur="2.94">going to hand them off to the syrian</text>

  <text start="1084.77" dur="6.72">Kurds they also received drones from the</text>
  <text start="1088.58" dur="5.61">US and these types of systems well</text>
  <text start="1091.49" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re for local reconnaissance they</text>
  <text start="1094.19" dur="4.29">aid in targeting of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1096.08" dur="5.97">fighters and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1098.48" dur="5.7">using some type of drones for their</text>
  <text start="1102.05" dur="4.35">missions now we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1104.18" dur="5.25">happening right now where the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1106.4" dur="4.8">pushing their agenda in Syria we know</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="3.57">they set up eight to nine secret bases</text>

  <text start="1205.45" dur="3.599">as long as they can run a pipeline</text>
  <text start="1207.159" dur="4.171">through it and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1209.049" dur="5.87">joined up with the Kurds now Russia has</text>
