  <text start="38.52" dur="5.219">August fifth 2016 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="4.621">episode is that job numbers are not what</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="5.731">you think the economy accelerates to the</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="6.72">downside let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.47" dur="6.049">collapse financial news now we all know</text>
  <text start="52.65" dur="6.54">that the job numbers came out today and</text>
  <text start="55.519" dur="7.18">we can see that this is a run-up it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="6.56">propaganda piece to bring the job</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="7.921">numbers the unemployment number down</text>
  <text start="65.75" dur="6.28">right before the elections and actually</text>
  <text start="70.62" dur="4.02">i&amp;#39;ll make this prediction right now i</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t like making predictions but i can</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="5.04">see this one this is exactly where</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re heading there using this time</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.1">period right now to show that the</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="4.83">economy is improving with these</text>
  <text start="83.78" dur="4.03">manipulated falsified numbers that</text>
  <text start="86.4" dur="4.469">they&amp;#39;re throwing out to the public and</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re saying look we&amp;#39;re back on track</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="3.031">and we see the corporate media out there</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="3.84">telling everyone that we&amp;#39;re back on</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="5.4">track and we see today the stock market</text>
  <text start="96.33" dur="6.15">rising gold was suppressed dramatically</text>
  <text start="99.3" dur="5.07">today by twenty dollars or so and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="102.48" dur="4.95">going to say this is a run-up to make</text>
  <text start="104.37" dur="7.89">everyone believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="7.2">getting back on track and we can see</text>
  <text start="112.26" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re going to make a play right</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="4.92">before the elections to bring this</text>
  <text start="116.73" dur="6.08">unemployment rate down from 4.9 i</text>
  <text start="119.55" dur="8.12">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if it goes to 4.6</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="8.05">to prove to the country and the world</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="8.89">that the United States has recovered</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="8.7">from 2008 so I would suspect that they</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="6.06">would do this most likely the middle to</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="7.02">the end of sep tember right before the</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="6.839">elections and they&amp;#39;re probably going to</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="4.68">do it right around that time period now</text>
  <text start="149.459" dur="3.36">it could be a little bit after a little</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="3.99">bit before but it&amp;#39;s going to be around</text>
  <text start="152.819" dur="4.23">that area but when we look at other</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="5.67">countries we see they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="6.361">struggling Canada for instance their</text>
  <text start="160.92" dur="3.23">economy has lost thirty 1,200 jobs in</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="2.82">July</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="6.34">because what&amp;#39;s happening is the full</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="6.72">time jobs they fell dramatically fewer</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="6.27">younger Canadians while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="4.95">unemployed they can&amp;#39;t find jobs and</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="4.28">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="5.73">this is that the economist in Canada</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="5.26">thought during this period they were</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="5.4">going to create 10,000 jobs for that</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="4.47">month and they didn&amp;#39;t so the</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="5.22">unemployment rate ticked up to six point</text>
  <text start="190.77" dur="9.41">nine percent from 6.8 and we can see</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="9.39">that full-time workers fell by 70 1,400</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="10.96">but don&amp;#39;t worry the whole thing was</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="11.79">offset by 40,000 part-time jobs now this</text>
  <text start="211.14" dur="7.62">is in the age group of 15 to 24 prime</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="5.28">working age especially those who are</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="4.38">coming out of high school those who are</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="5.07">coming out of college it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="5.55">difficult for a lot of these young</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="5.58">individuals to get high paying full time</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="4.56">jobs i know many individuals who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="231.36" dur="3.45">writing in to me saying i&amp;#39;m at i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="3.39">having a very difficult time i have a</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="5.85">lot of student loans i have a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="6.36">bills but i cannot find that job ontario</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="5.85">they lost about thirty six thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="243" dur="6.87">last month alberta canada uh they saw</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="7.08">their unemployment rate rise to eight</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="7.23">point six percent and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="6.39">trouble finding work so this is actually</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="5.58">spreading too many countries we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="4.23">seeing this all throughout europe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="3.33">actually seeing in here in the united</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.07">states but we have the illusion that</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="5.22">everything is fine now today we know the</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="6.54">job numbers came out the BLS reported</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="8.73">that July payroll sword by 255,000 above</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="6.09">the highest Wall Street forecast I mean</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="6.06">they thought that this was going to come</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="7.29">in around one hundred and seventy eight</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.64">thousand or so but the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="5.67">remained at 4.9 percentage and really</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="6.3">didn&amp;#39;t move the participation rate rose</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="7.62">modestly from 62.8 from</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="7.26">2.7 not much but when you add all this</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.37">together you&amp;#39;re seeing that we&amp;#39;re over a</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="7.89">hundred million people who are looking</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="9.059">for work that can&amp;#39;t find work this is a</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="8.55">problem now when we look at the job</text>
  <text start="316.919" dur="7.051">numbers the job headlines that are all</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="4.77">over the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="6.96">government is pushing it out there they</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="7.919">might be overstating the strength of the</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="6.15">jobs because when we look at payroll</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="7.79">data when we look at other information</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="9.6">we see anomalies in the job numbers</text>
  <text start="342.139" dur="8.981">unadjusted data shows a different type</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="7.56">of report nowhere as strong as what they</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="6.69">are saying and adds that private</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="9.209">payrolls unadjusted 85,000 in July</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="9.69">versed 217,000 jobs that were added so</text>
  <text start="363.449" dur="8.611">it looks like they massaged manipulated</text>
  <text start="367.5" dur="8.18">the numbers to bring it up to 217 the</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.789">private payrolls are only showing 85,000</text>
  <text start="375.68" dur="4.18">so the government what they did they</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="4.861">applied a very benign seasonal</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.339">adjustment factor upon private payrolls</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="6.299">to transform a soft private payroll gain</text>
  <text start="385.199" dur="7.71">into a strong one to make it look a lot</text>
  <text start="389.009" dur="8.4">better than it really is so where are</text>
  <text start="392.909" dur="9.211">the jobs for July while South Bay</text>
  <text start="397.409" dur="8.221">research points out it&amp;#39;s Obamacare they</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="7.039">have offset the week industrial and</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="5.9">consumer payrolls and we can see</text>
  <text start="409.159" dur="4.991">Obamacare and the health care industry</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="6.28">they have brought in forty nine thousand</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="6.96">jobs now of course we have a major</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="6.329">problem this Obamacare is failing more</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="6.179">than half of the exchanges have</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="6.901">collapsed and defaulted the others are</text>
  <text start="427.289" dur="6.001">teetering on default</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="5.03">and premiums are continually moving up</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="7.73">construction right now well guess what</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="12.6">those jobs have decreased manufacturing</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="10.48">retail very weak mining declining and</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="6.06">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="5.97">these job numbers were manipulated and</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="5.2">if we look very closely at this we see</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="4.95">that there have been a half a million</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="9.54">waiter and bartender jobs added since</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="9">2014 and no manufacturing jobs this data</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="5.28">underscores how the job recovery has</text>
  <text start="471.42" dur="6.12">been spearheaded by cheap labor with job</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="7.92">gains going to guess what the least</text>
  <text start="477.54" dur="8.19">educated lowest paid part-time work it</text>
  <text start="482.67" dur="5.4">also means that while the BLS can apply</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="6.47">these seasonal adjustment things to the</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="6.78">job numbers the unadjusted payrolls</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="6.7">they&amp;#39;re showing something completely</text>
  <text start="494.85" dur="7.89">different and we see there has been a</text>
  <text start="498.9" dur="6.92">lot of jobs that have been lost let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="6.54">take the energy industry for instance</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="5.77">now challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas has</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="5.1">reported that a hundred and ninety-five</text>
  <text start="511.59" dur="5.4">thousand good-paying energy jobs have</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="5.82">been lost since 2014 actually if you</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="5.04">take the total number of jobs that have</text>
  <text start="520.2" dur="3.779">been lost since 2014 according to</text>
  <text start="522.03" dur="6.51">challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="6.001">talking a million-plus but remember the</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="3.99">US government they got rid of that</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="6.84">department that counts layoffs back in</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="6.45">2013 because of budget restraints so the</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="5.61">good paying jobs they&amp;#39;re disappearing</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="5.36">the part-time jobs well this is what</text>
  <text start="542.43" dur="5.46">people are getting if they can find them</text>
  <text start="544.34" dur="7">because we know in the waiter bartender</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="8.15">industry we know that they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="551.34" dur="9.3">problems traffic is starting to decline</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="6.49">so we&amp;#39;re in big trouble here and when we</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="4.46">look at this we can see that other</text>
  <text start="562.53" dur="4.83">things are occurring here</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="6.1">corporate tax receipts are down by</text>
  <text start="567.36" dur="8.7">eleven percent year-to-date we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="571.2" dur="7.41">that non withheld tax receipts are down</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="4.77">by six point five percent and if we</text>
  <text start="578.61" dur="4.53">start putting all this together from the</text>
  <text start="580.83" dur="4.83">other reports all the retail stores that</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="4.65">have been closing thousands upon</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="3.39">thousands of retail stores all those</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="4.98">individuals they&amp;#39;ve been laying off from</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="6.3">retail if we take an account factory</text>
  <text start="592.77" dur="6.39">orders are declining Class eight</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="7.77">trucking is declining rail traffic is</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="6.98">declining the housing bubble prices are</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="7.17">now coming down the housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="606.14" dur="6.52">losing air it&amp;#39;s about to pop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="6.419">seeing this spread in Australia in</text>
  <text start="612.66" dur="5.58">Canada UK Europe and by the way this has</text>
  <text start="616.709" dur="3.391">nothing to do with the brexit this has</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="4.08">been happening for a very long time this</text>
  <text start="620.1" dur="3.63">is why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this from the</text>
  <text start="622.32" dur="2.94">beginning so nobody can come up and say</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="4.41">hey that just happened because of the</text>
  <text start="625.26" dur="6.39">brexit hey this just happened because of</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="5.52">this scenario or that scenario we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="631.65" dur="5.55">been tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="633.66" dur="7.53">it for a very long time if we went back</text>
  <text start="637.2" dur="6.21">to 2004-2005 and tracked everything</text>
  <text start="641.19" dur="9.39">leading up to two thousand eight we saw</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="10.47">actually we&amp;#39;ve seen the same thing the</text>
  <text start="650.58" dur="7.49">same thing occurred all the way up to</text>
  <text start="653.88" dur="7.17">the time the entire economy collapsed</text>
  <text start="658.07" dur="6.31">now we talked about the GDP and how</text>
  <text start="661.05" dur="6.6">Obama hasn&amp;#39;t had a quarter over three</text>
  <text start="664.38" dur="7.41">percent so all of a sudden the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="667.65" dur="6.96">Fed came out with their forecast that</text>
  <text start="671.79" dur="6">out of nowhere the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="674.61" dur="7.14">grow by three-point-eight percent very</text>
  <text start="677.79" dur="6.239">interesting but on the other hand the</text>
  <text start="681.75" dur="4.68">federal reserve bank of new york they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.029" dur="5.011">saying that gdp is going to be growing</text>
  <text start="686.43" dur="5.21">by two-point-six percent completely</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="5.669">different it&amp;#39;s one-point-two percent</text>
  <text start="691.64" dur="5.11">difference between the two that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="694.709" dur="3.431">big difference but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="4.21">right now is</text>
  <text start="698.14" dur="5.79">add whatever they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="6.6">manipulating game they are on the</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="6.75">economy will always show us what&amp;#39;s</text>
