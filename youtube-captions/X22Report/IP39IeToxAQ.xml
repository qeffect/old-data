  <text start="30.74" dur="5.65">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="4.591">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="5.489">episode 891 be and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="4.8">februari 11th 2016 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="6.061">episode is us now looking to the</text>
  <text start="44.22" dur="6.78">coalition to fund their proxy wars let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="5.67">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="51" dur="4.17">and geopolitical news now we have been</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="4.71">seeing government&amp;#39;s the World Health</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="6.75">Organization the CDC pushing the</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="6.51">propaganda that Zika virus causes</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.68">microcephaly and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="3.75">trying to make the case that this is</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="4.26">what happens we know that the president</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="4.649">of United States put aside one poor is</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="6.299">asking for 1.8 billion dollars to fight</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="7.471">this Zika virus to help pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="5.011">companies create vaccines but this whole</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="4.8">thing is a complete hoax because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="5.01">no correlation to microcephaly so a</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="4.829">group of doctors looked into this in</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="5.43">South America and they wanted to see</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="4.471">well is it the Zika virus is it the</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="8.69">mosquitoes that are causing this problem</text>
  <text start="94.8" dur="12">and they looked into it and they found</text>
  <text start="101.3" dur="7.03">that in this area where this started the</text>
  <text start="106.8" dur="3.99">Brazilian people the low-income</text>
  <text start="108.33" dur="8.06">Brazilian people in this area they were</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="9.48">exposed exposed to chemical larvicide</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="9.28">they were basically exposed to mass</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="8.659">fumigation in that area and the Zika</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="6.81">virus has nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="8.95">because the brain deformations of the</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="10.16">children are correlating to this</text>
  <text start="137.879" dur="7.741">chemical they used in mass fumigations</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="6.79">now the doctors are from red university</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="7.84">of environmental and health and when</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="9.76">they looked into it they see that</text>
  <text start="153.46" dur="10.25">the chemical pyro proc suphan which is a</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="8.18">poison was used now this chemical is</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="5.77">manufactured by sumit Omo chemical a</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="8.11">corporation known to be a strategic</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="10.29">partner of Monsanto and the doctors say</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s a subsidiary of Monsanto and what</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="5.55">this chemical does it is a growth</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="4.89">inhibitor of mosquito larvae which</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="4.73">alters the development process from</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="5.97">larvae to pupae to adult thus generating</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="6.85">malformations in developing mosquitoes</text>
  <text start="193.06" dur="5.79">and killing or disabling them and of</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="3.84">course as they spray the area it gets</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="6.57">into the drinking water it gets all over</text>
  <text start="200.74" dur="8.4">the place and this correlates now to</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="8.54">this mass fumigation that&amp;#39;s why it was</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="7.8">in this isolated area now of course</text>
  <text start="213.96" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re using this as a cover story that</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="6.81">the Zika virus is causing this Zika is</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="7.41">spreading all over the place and we see</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="8.28">at this point this is being done to hide</text>
  <text start="227.32" dur="7.92">all of this and again this is what</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="5.85">governments do they use propaganda they</text>
  <text start="235.24" dur="4.85">lie to the people to convince you of</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="6.69">something that&amp;#39;s really not happening</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="9.22">now out in Oregon we see that the</text>
  <text start="244.57" dur="9.42">standoff in the Wildlife Center has come</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="8.28">to an end the three of the four Oregon</text>
  <text start="253.99" dur="5.43">protestors have surrendered and it looks</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="5.58">like there is one that is holding out</text>
  <text start="259.42" dur="6.95">right now most likely he will also</text>
  <text start="263.17" dur="5.91">surrender and this will come to an end</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="7.63">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting as cliven</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="7.68">Bundy was flying over there and when he</text>
  <text start="274" dur="5.28">got off the plane he was arrested</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="4.74">immediately on conspiracy charges which</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="4.1">is absolutely ridiculous hasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="3.98">done anything and they just arrest him</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="4.24">but we see why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="285.48" dur="6.649">they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="6.66">this whole incident to justify why they</text>
  <text start="292.129" dur="7.701">need a task force to go after</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="9.009">anti-government extremists and the organ</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="8.109">ranchers they are the poster child for</text>
  <text start="303.289" dur="7.081">this new agenda and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="307.939" dur="4.861">pushing this very very hard because they</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="4.62">realize this is not going to be the only</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.56">incident because as people become more</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.31">aware of what&amp;#39;s going on people get</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="4.649">upset people say I don&amp;#39;t like what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="3.51">going on in this country we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="4.141">see more of this and they realize this</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="7.079">and they know and they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="326.15" dur="6.449">to squash it before it occurs and we see</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="4.171">in Twitter right now when I mentioned</text>
  <text start="332.599" dur="5.431">this before that they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="6.87">Ministry of Truth which is kind of right</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="7.83">out of George Orwell&amp;#39;s novel 1984 where</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="6.299">they&amp;#39;ll be monitoring Twitter posts and</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="6.54">I think what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="8.49">this their actual Council is called</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="9.449">trust and safety council and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.719" dur="9.95">forming this to keep you safe as you</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="7.081">blog I mean I don&amp;#39;t need to be kept safe</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="3.941">if I want to say something I&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="3.329">something if I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="3.419">something i&amp;#39;ll talk about it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="5.611">need a group to tell me if it&amp;#39;s okay or</text>
  <text start="374.029" dur="5.04">not okay and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="4.769">have a group of like 40 organizations</text>
  <text start="379.069" dur="6.06">and experts from 13 regions joining this</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="5.34">member council and they&amp;#39;re putting them</text>
  <text start="385.129" dur="6.171">all together and this council is kind of</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="7.141">Orwellian because when you look at this</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="9.16">roster of people or groups in this</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="9.84">council over there overwhelmingly biased</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="6">in favor of speech suppression the</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="4.29">council includes more than 40</text>
  <text start="406.46" dur="4.919">organizations that will be tasked with</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="3.449">helping Twitter and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="3.72">strike the right balance between</text>
  <text start="412.699" dur="7.62">fighting abuse and speaking truth to</text>
  <text start="415.099" dur="6.091">power well if the goal was really define</text>
  <text start="420.319" dur="3.481">some middle ground</text>
  <text start="421.19" dur="5.61">between total free speech and safeguards</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="5.58">against harassment you would think</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="6">Twitter would have some diversity of</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="6.84">opinion you would think they would bring</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="9.57">in other voices or other groups into the</text>
  <text start="436.22" dur="10.14">mix none of these groups in this council</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="7.44">or free speech organizations which I</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="5.72">find very odd this shows you that</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re going to try to lock it down</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re going to take things away that</text>
  <text start="454.85" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t want people to see or hear of</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="7.53">what&amp;#39;s going on and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="460.13" dur="7.71">of this in social media and I think when</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="5.28">the FBI was out there scaring the world</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="6.42">that you know Isis is taking to Twitter</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="6.36">Isis is taking the facebook they were</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="6.18">pushing that agenda not to scare</text>
  <text start="476.54" dur="6.78">everyone that was part of it but also to</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="8.04">have each one of these social media</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="8.04">companies create some type of group that</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="6.09">will monitor what people are saying and</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="6.15">have them take it down when necessary</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="6.29">and you know the government was</text>
  <text start="497.51" dur="7.17">instrumental in helping them along and</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="7.02">creating these type of groups we see it</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="6.06">in facebook we see it in youtube and</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="5.409">they&amp;#39;re doing this to everything just</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="5.54">like France that is the poster child of</text>
  <text start="513.289" dur="9.091">taking away your rights and basically</text>
  <text start="516.28" dur="11.5">becoming a police state so out in North</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="8.58">Korea we see the US Senate they pass new</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="6.78">legislation 96 20 imposing additional</text>
  <text start="530.96" dur="6.87">sanctions on North Korea basically the</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="6.54">Senate bill will targets North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="6.42">ability to access money the legislation</text>
  <text start="541.1" dur="7.79">also authorizes 50 million for radio</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="7.44">broadcasts into the isolated country</text>
  <text start="548.89" dur="5.08">propaganda basically to try to convince</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="5.23">the people to overthrow their government</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="5.68">now we know the u.s. came out and said</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="5.76">ah North Korea just launched you know a</text>
  <text start="559.65" dur="5.22">rocket this is absolutely ridiculous we</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="5.28">need sanctions we need missiles in South</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="4.74">Korea and after criticizing North Korea</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="4.26">for launching the satellite into space</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="4.16">which they told the UN which kind of</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="3.72">everyone knew they were going to do this</text>
  <text start="573.77" dur="6.94">the United States launched their own</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="8.25">satellite into orbit yesterday but the</text>
  <text start="580.71" dur="6.03">payload is classified so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="4.47">strange that the u.s. is out there</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="3.75">criticizing one country for launching a</text>
  <text start="588.66" dur="6.09">satellite into space and they do it a</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="7.02">couple days later and again countries</text>
  <text start="594.75" dur="5.43">are allowed to launch satellites into</text>
  <text start="597.51" dur="4.92">space they&amp;#39;re allowed to move military</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="5.4">assets all inside their country wherever</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="6.48">they want doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="605.58" dur="6.54">use it sometimes they have drills in</text>
  <text start="608.91" dur="6.81">their countries sometimes they just have</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="8.9">to move things but the u.s. uses this</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="8.49">for propaganda purposes out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="5.77">the dawn ants convoy is saying Kiev is</text>
  <text start="624.21" dur="5.01">lying about meeting the Minsk</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="5.94">commitments he says they&amp;#39;re not telling</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="6.27">the truth they haven&amp;#39;t met any of the</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="4.26">commitments on the settlement in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="5.24">under the Minsk agreements we&amp;#39;ve signed</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="6.75">this a a year ago and since this time</text>
  <text start="640.73" dur="5.85">nothing&amp;#39;s been done which I agree with</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="6.6">nothing has been done you know why</text>
  <text start="646.58" dur="7.03">because the US doesn&amp;#39;t want the Minsk to</text>
  <text start="650.34" dur="6.29">cease fire agreement fulfilled that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="7.92">they&amp;#39;re telling Kiev absolutely not</text>
  <text start="656.63" dur="8.98">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on now we see the</text>
  <text start="661.53" dur="6.09">shelling in Kiev is continuing and it</text>
  <text start="665.61" dur="4.65">looks like they are moving their</text>
  <text start="667.62" dur="6.51">military assets around firing on don</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="6.78">bass and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="674.13" dur="6.63">world that we need peacekeepers inside</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="6.42">of this area they had a bus bomb they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.76" dur="5.21">shelling they close the border the</text>
  <text start="683.46" dur="4.23">checkpoints in Lugansk and Donetsk and</text>
  <text start="685.97" dur="4.63">they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="687.69" dur="5.28">pushing the agenda and harassing the</text>
  <text start="690.6" dur="4.08">OSCE to say see we have all these</text>
  <text start="692.97" dur="6.18">problems in this area we need</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="8.07">peacekeepers and under the mince to</text>
  <text start="699.15" dur="5.64">cease fire agreement there is no section</text>
  <text start="702.75" dur="3.48">in there that has anything to do with</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="4.02">peacekeepers but they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="4.62">this whole area needs it because look</text>
  <text start="708.81" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s happening and you can see what</text>
  <text start="710.85" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="712.47" dur="4.92">push an offensive and if they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="715.32" dur="6.63">the peacekeepers in there they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="717.39" dur="10.95">for the offensive now out in Crimea we</text>
  <text start="721.95" dur="10.95">see that Russia is bringing in military</text>
  <text start="728.34" dur="7.14">assets for a military exercise they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="732.9" dur="6.03">bringing in more troops anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="735.48" dur="7.17">defense systems in Crimea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="5.52">reinforcing everything so this should</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="5.27">tell us that something is definitely</text>
  <text start="744.45" dur="8.28">going on in Ukraine and it looks like</text>
  <text start="747.92" dur="7.78">Russia is preparing and fortifying</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="4.74">Crimea because we know that the United</text>
  <text start="755.7" dur="4.29">States the central bankers have not</text>
  <text start="757.47" dur="4.77">gotten what they paid for and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="759.99" dur="4.23">going to go after the south the</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="6.84">southeastern section and Crimea and</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="8.07">Russia knows this now Russia they flown</text>
  <text start="769.08" dur="5.97">in to cargo aircraft which delivered</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="5.46">about 50 tons of humanitarian aid to a</text>
  <text start="775.05" dur="6.75">Syrian Air Base to help the Syrian</text>
  <text start="777.75" dur="5.67">people we see that Lavrov and carry</text>
  <text start="781.8" dur="4.8">their meeting on the sidelines of Munich</text>
  <text start="783.42" dur="6.78">and with their security conference talk</text>
  <text start="786.6" dur="6.9">about Syria and what Russia is proposing</text>
  <text start="790.2" dur="4.77">to basically end the civil war in Syria</text>
  <text start="793.5" dur="3.33">which is really not a civil war because</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="4.77">the United States funded the entire</text>
  <text start="796.83" dur="6.63">thing they want Assad overthrown they</text>
  <text start="799.74" dur="7.13">pay for the terrorists and Russia&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="806.87" dur="8.98">basically stop all the wars in this area</text>
  <text start="812.19" dur="7.17">is it going to work most likely not now</text>
  <text start="815.85" dur="5.46">NATO very interestingly they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="819.36" dur="5.97">basically bring in ships</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="6.6">in the agency and they&amp;#39;re saying without</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="5.46">delay they&amp;#39;re going to support German</text>

  <text start="839.279" dur="3.481">this really what they&amp;#39;re doing most</text>
  <text start="841.529" dur="5.521">likely not it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="842.76" dur="6.48">positioning some ships in this area NATO</text>
  <text start="847.05" dur="6.12">is going to intensify reconnaissance on</text>
  <text start="849.24" dur="6.27">the turkish-syrian border and this is</text>
  <text start="853.17" dur="7.58">coming from nATO Secretary General Jens</text>
  <text start="855.51" dur="10.35">Stoltenberg NATO is also considering</text>
  <text start="860.75" dur="6.339">troop deployment in this area now of</text>
  <text start="865.86" dur="3.96">course they&amp;#39;re saying well we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="867.089" dur="4.621">nervous about the Islamic state and we</text>
  <text start="869.82" dur="7.04">might need to bring troops into this</text>
  <text start="871.71" dur="10.55">area now all of this is leading up to a</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="7.66">war in this area I mean we see too many</text>
  <text start="882.26" dur="4.87">coincidental things occurring at the</text>
  <text start="884.52" dur="4.71">same time we have the amphibious ships</text>
  <text start="887.13" dur="4.17">coming from the US which are the same</text>
  <text start="889.23" dur="6.12">ones that were used back in 2013 of</text>
  <text start="891.3" dur="7.2">August and those are going to the same</text>
  <text start="895.35" dur="5.46">exact area we see the British fleet</text>
  <text start="898.5" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re bringing in their warships into</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="6.21">the Black Sea into that area which is</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="5.1">the opposite side of Turkey which</text>
  <text start="907.02" dur="4.77">basically they can just sell those ships</text>
  <text start="909.48" dur="9.359">right into the Mediterranean and be in</text>
  <text start="911.79" dur="9.299">Syria in no time we see that troops are</text>
  <text start="918.839" dur="3.931">being built up and they&amp;#39;re being trained</text>
  <text start="921.089" dur="4.801">in Jordan once again we have another</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="5.49">drill going on all these things are</text>
  <text start="925.89" dur="5.79">happening at the same time now NATO is</text>
  <text start="928.26" dur="7.98">out there helping with the refugee</text>
  <text start="931.68" dur="7.529">problem and bringing in ships now the US</text>
  <text start="936.24" dur="4.53">as Aleppo is falling and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="939.209" dur="4.32">government and Russia is taken aback</text>
  <text start="940.77" dur="5.61">they decided they were going to bomb the</text>
  <text start="943.529" dur="5.821">city of Aleppo with a TENS now what they</text>
  <text start="946.38" dur="4.86">bomb we don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="949.35" dur="5.04">they bombed oil fields and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="951.24" dur="3.52">hitting the Islamic state and then they</text>
  <text start="954.39" dur="3.16">blame</text>
  <text start="954.76" dur="5.58">and the bombings on hospitals and</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="6.24">killing civilians on Russia and Russia</text>
  <text start="960.34" dur="7.92">said whoa just a minute we didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="963.79" dur="7.89">have planes in the air at this time so</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="7.68">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible for us to</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="7.41">have bomb to hospitals so basically what</text>
  <text start="975.94" dur="6.09">happened is the United States bombed</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="4.8">civilians bombed hospitals most likely</text>
  <text start="982.03" dur="5.93">bombed the infrastructure going after</text>
  <text start="983.89" dur="7.01">the Syrian army and civilians and</text>
  <text start="987.96" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to blame this on Russia</text>
  <text start="990.9" dur="4.36">because they don&amp;#39;t want Aleppo to fall</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t want Syria to take full</text>
  <text start="995.26" dur="5.55">control of it neither does turkey they</text>
  <text start="997.93" dur="7.8">don&amp;#39;t want this to occur and we see</text>
  <text start="1000.81" dur="8.7">already that the u.s. Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1005.73" dur="6.09">Turkey NATO the coalition forces they</text>
  <text start="1009.51" dur="6.81">are getting ready and prepared for</text>
  <text start="1011.82" dur="6.99">something big u.s. is pushing propaganda</text>
  <text start="1016.32" dur="5.87">that the Russian campaign right now in</text>
  <text start="1018.81" dur="5.55">Syria is helping the Islamic state know</text>
  <text start="1022.19" dur="4.96">basically they&amp;#39;re losing their proxy</text>
  <text start="1024.36" dur="5.82">army Russia has already destroyed the</text>
  <text start="1027.15" dur="6.54">oil convoy the revenue is trickling in</text>
  <text start="1030.18" dur="7.95">right now a lot of the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="1033.69" dur="6.86">been airlifted out of Syria and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.13" dur="5.76">very interesting is Ashton Carter is</text>
  <text start="1040.55" dur="12.16">going around to all the Persian Gulf</text>
  <text start="1043.89" dur="10.17">states asking for more we need funds to</text>
  <text start="1052.71" dur="3.39">fight the Islamic state now I see</text>
  <text start="1054.06" dur="3.66">Australia saying oh we&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="1056.1" dur="4.38">funds to fight the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1057.72" dur="5.04">help out in this situation what I think</text>
  <text start="1060.48" dur="6.12">is happening right now is they&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="1062.76" dur="7.71">all of these countries to make up the</text>
  <text start="1066.6" dur="8.57">difference for the lost revenue of the</text>
  <text start="1070.47" dur="9">oil convoys because remember Russia</text>
  <text start="1075.17" dur="7.93">destroyed the oil convoys exposed Turkey</text>
  <text start="1079.47" dur="5.85">in running this operation and remember</text>
  <text start="1083.1" dur="4.38">that the US Treasury Department they had</text>
  <text start="1085.32" dur="3.12">exact numbers of how much the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1087.48" dur="2.55">state was making</text>
  <text start="1088.44" dur="2.82">they just couldn&amp;#39;t find the trucks but</text>
  <text start="1090.03" dur="3.39">they knew exactly how much they were</text>
  <text start="1091.26" dur="5.22">making it is the wealthiest terrorist</text>
  <text start="1093.42" dur="4.5">group in the world and now all of a</text>
  <text start="1096.48" dur="4.11">sudden the revenue has trickled down to</text>
  <text start="1097.92" dur="6.21">nothing and I think to keep this</text>
  <text start="1100.59" dur="5.46">operational they need revenue coming in</text>
  <text start="1104.13" dur="6.42">and right now they&amp;#39;re asking the</text>
  <text start="1106.05" dur="6.15">countries to assist for donations we</text>
  <text start="1110.55" dur="5.76">need donations for our terrorist group</text>
  <text start="1112.2" dur="6.2">can you please help out this is what it</text>
  <text start="1116.31" dur="4.17">looks like Saudi Arabia right now</text>
  <text start="1118.4" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re making the final decision to</text>
  <text start="1120.48" dur="4.5">send troops into Syria now is Saudi</text>
  <text start="1123.6" dur="3.51">Arabia really going to make that much of</text>
  <text start="1124.98" dur="4.62">a difference well they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1127.11" dur="5.82">soldiers on the ready they&amp;#39;re paid</text>
  <text start="1129.6" dur="6.14">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re not even Saudi</text>
  <text start="1132.93" dur="7.11">Arabian troops a lot of them are outside</text>
  <text start="1135.74" dur="6.34">mercenaries and we can see why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1140.04" dur="6.47">doing this at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1142.08" dur="6.93">building up a force berta one is</text>
  <text start="1146.51" dur="4.66">threatening Europe right now saying we</text>
  <text start="1149.01" dur="6.21">are going to unleash millions upon</text>
  <text start="1151.17" dur="7.98">millions of refugees upon you once again</text>
  <text start="1155.22" dur="9.24">we want you to pay and we want you to</text>
  <text start="1159.15" dur="10.04">join us because we need a safe zone this</text>
  <text start="1164.46" dur="9.09">is what he&amp;#39;s saying we need a new or a</text>
  <text start="1169.19" dur="9.22">brand new type of no fly safe zone where</text>
  <text start="1173.55" dur="7.02">these refugees can stay and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1178.41" dur="6">stay in Turkey they have to stay in</text>
  <text start="1180.57" dur="5.82">Syria so they&amp;#39;re trying to push the idea</text>
  <text start="1184.41" dur="3.93">that we&amp;#39;re going to have six hundred</text>
  <text start="1186.39" dur="2.97">thousand refugees coming from Syria they</text>
  <text start="1188.34" dur="2.64">don&amp;#39;t know where they got this number</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="5.28">they just made it up out of thin air</text>
  <text start="1190.98" dur="7.17">coming into Turkey and turkeys going to</text>
  <text start="1194.64" dur="5.31">unleash millions of these refugees that</text>
  <text start="1198.15" dur="5.43">they already have in their country plus</text>
  <text start="1199.95" dur="5.64">the 600,000 on Europe unless they say</text>
  <text start="1203.58" dur="7.71">okay we&amp;#39;re going to help you establish</text>
  <text start="1205.59" dur="9.48">this safe zone so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1211.29" dur="5.58">right now is the u.s. they have a base</text>
  <text start="1215.07" dur="5.91">in Syria they&amp;#39;re extending it to bring</text>
  <text start="1216.87" dur="5.35">in the c-130 transport planes we see</text>
  <text start="1220.98" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re building the border</text>
  <text start="1222.22" dur="8.189">up with Syria adding security because</text>
  <text start="1227.85" dur="5.53">having the security with the safe zone</text>
  <text start="1230.409" dur="5.211">bordering Turkey this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1233.38" dur="6.57">they want they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="1235.62" dur="6.34">once again and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1239.95" dur="5.359">watch this very carefully because all of</text>
  <text start="1241.96" dur="6.93">these pieces are now coming into place</text>
  <text start="1245.309" dur="5.891">the u.s. they are backed up against the</text>
  <text start="1248.89" dur="4.32">wall they have no other place to go at</text>
  <text start="1251.2" dur="5.729">this time because if the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1253.21" dur="5.339">is completely defeated in Syria what is</text>
  <text start="1256.929" dur="3.811">the reason for the United States the BN</text>
  <text start="1258.549" dur="4.321">sorry there is no reason they would have</text>
  <text start="1260.74" dur="4.98">to leave well they don&amp;#39;t want to leave</text>
  <text start="1262.87" dur="5.16">just yet so they need to create</text>
  <text start="1265.72" dur="4.53">something at this point yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1268.03" dur="4.17">talking to Russia or actually Russia is</text>
  <text start="1270.25" dur="3.87">talking to the United States saying we</text>
  <text start="1272.2" dur="3.42">have a plan to stop all this but the</text>
  <text start="1274.12" dur="3.72">United States really want this to stop</text>
  <text start="1275.62" dur="4.11">because they want Assad overthrown</text>
  <text start="1277.84" dur="4.199">because eventually they have to go into</text>
  <text start="1279.73" dur="5.61">Iran because Iran is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1282.039" dur="6.571">using the dollar on the reserve on their</text>
  <text start="1285.34" dur="6.12">oil on their natural resources so the</text>
  <text start="1288.61" dur="6.689">prize is Iran to get to Iran they need</text>
  <text start="1291.46" dur="7.23">Syria and we can see at this point they</text>
  <text start="1295.299" dur="5.191">will never give this up if they do this</text>
  <text start="1298.69" dur="5.04">system just comes down and crashes and</text>
  <text start="1300.49" dur="7.559">they know this so they can&amp;#39;t turn back</text>
  <text start="1303.73" dur="6.09">they only can go forward and this is why</text>
  <text start="1308.049" dur="3.151">they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard this is why</text>
  <text start="1309.82" dur="4.16">they&amp;#39;re putting all the pieces together</text>
  <text start="1311.2" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re coming up with a new plan and</text>
  <text start="1313.98" dur="4.36">we&amp;#39;re going to have to wait to see what</text>
  <text start="1316.059" dur="4.11">this new plan is listen everyone thanks</text>
