  <text start="38.129" dur="4.591">sanctions on Russia and of course today</text>
  <text start="40.409" dur="5.491">the US came out and they impose</text>
  <text start="42.72" dur="5.31">sanctions on Russia imposed the</text>
  <text start="45.9" dur="4.47">sanctions on individuals and also in</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="4.709">certain sectors of Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="4.23">retaliated and said hey listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="52.739" dur="3.931">going to impose sanctions on certain</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="4.65">individuals and these are all ridiculous</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="5.37">sanctions they actually mean nothing and</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="4.86">again if United States if the people of</text>
  <text start="62.04" dur="3.299">the United States believe that these</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="5.61">sanctions are going to do anything</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re not these are incremental steps</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="4.23">to get the war started and this is what</text>
  <text start="72.119" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re trying to do because really do</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="4.26">they really believe that these sanctions</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="6.301">are going to force Russia to give back</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="7.11">Crimea no it&amp;#39;s not going to happen this</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="7.589">is all laid out to start war they need</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="6.329">something to to cover up this entire</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="4.47">collapse and if we really think about if</text>
  <text start="91.649" dur="5.941">they went out and they sanctioned Russia</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="7.261">completely this would have a devastating</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="4.349">effect on Europe because Russia could</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="3.119">just say you know what we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="3.81">to shut off these gals valves we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="104.039" dur="4.051">going to shut everything down you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="105.749" dur="6.57">burn out all the people in Europe will</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.9">not be receiving all of this gas will</text>
  <text start="112.319" dur="6.031">see other things happen because a lot of</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="6.18">the corporations are in Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="5.969">doing business in Russia and guess what</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="6.329">Russia&amp;#39;s economy strong United States</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="6.241">euro the urination economies week and</text>
  <text start="127.499" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;re very fragile at this point no</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="4.14">matter it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the Fed the</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="4.05">US government they&amp;#39;re out there telling</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="5.13">us and I were in this fantastic recovery</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re creating jobs we know this is a</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="2.34">lie</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s fake because if they have to keep</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="3.87">reminding us and again the president was</text>
  <text start="143.85" dur="5.67">out there again today reminding us how</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re in this fabulous recovery but</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="3.99">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="3.66">news will go through the sanctions and</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that a little bit later</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.17">in the report and we&amp;#39;re going to head</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="3.75">out the Cyprus right now and again we</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="3.6">understand they&amp;#39;re in capital controls</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="5.52">and you&amp;#39;re never going to believe this</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="6.03">but the housing market is still not</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="4.77">doing well well we have to understand</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.71">the capital controls are in effect</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="5.18">people can&amp;#39;t take out money there is</text>
  <text start="173.46" dur="4.92">absolutely no one going out and and</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="4.42">there&amp;#39;s no one going to purchase these</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="4.53">homes and this is why they see rents</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="4.92">residential prices for both houses and</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="5.6">flats fell by one point six percent</text>
  <text start="185.49" dur="5.4">during the fourth quarter of 2013 a</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="4.3">majority of asset classes and</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="5.46">geographies continued to be affected</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="6.42">with areas that had dropped and they are</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.98">not seeing really any improvement right</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="4.62">now and they&amp;#39;re not going to because</text>
  <text start="201.33" dur="4.74">they are receiving bailouts they had a</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="5.79">bail-in they stole the people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="206.07" dur="7.14">they put capital controls on the people</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="7.95">of Cyprus it is over a year now and now</text>
  <text start="213.21" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re saying springtime late spring we</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="5.01">might remove these capital controls and</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="4.62">again all these people who are living in</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="3.54">Cyprus are not running around going god</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="3.66">I need to buy a new house I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="3.33">get my money out but let me go buy</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="4.02">another house and again this is why we</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="5.07">see car sales down there we see housing</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="5.49">sales down there things are not turning</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.28">out well and they&amp;#39;re not turning out</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="5.1">well in Greece either I mean they</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="5.34">received a new loan a new tranche from</text>
  <text start="242.49" dur="4.77">the IMF and again this comes with</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.37">certain stipulations where they have to</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.88">impose austerity lay off people and this</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.73">does not help the economy whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="6.81">the Greek streets worth wrong with</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="5.4">delusion crowds as some 3,000 union</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="4.17">members hit the streets fed up with</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="6.66">austerity measures just as the country</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="5.9">secured another 8.5 billion euro coupled</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="4.77">with further spending cuts and</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="4.21">unemployment and we know this is not</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="3.84">going to help this</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="7.26">whatsoever the population is experienced</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="7.83">periods six six straight years of</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="7.47">recession unemployment is twenty-eight</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="6.99">percent and under 25 years old they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="5.04">experiencing the sharp end of it the</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="6.45">youth unemployment right now is sixty</text>
  <text start="294" dur="7.14">percent and again this is not helping it</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="4.29">is making everything worse and if we</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="3.09">have to think back when they first</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="4.23">received the first bailout and they told</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="5.4">us everything was going to be fine since</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="7.76">that time the economy over the four</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="8.31">years has shrunk by twenty-five percent</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="5.98">so are they making it better or are they</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="4.44">actually making a lot worse and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="4.08">going to say they&amp;#39;re making it a lot</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="5.76">worse now the president out there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="6.3">having this televised a discussion and</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="6.24">he&amp;#39;s out there letting everyone now how</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s improving the economy for everybody</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="2.76">how he&amp;#39;s going to create you I mean they</text>
  <text start="336.03" dur="2.7">never tell you how they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="3.36">it he&amp;#39;s telling you all the things that</text>
  <text start="338.73" dur="2.88">we should be doing this is what we</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="3.33">should be doing we should be creating</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="3.87">jobs we should be doing this never</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.5">giving you real facts never really</text>
  <text start="345.48" dur="5.49">giving the real data well guess what the</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="5.73">real data is the complete opposite of</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="5.97">what he is saying and again claims</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="4.89">missed by most in eight weeks initial</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="4.59">jobless claims rose for the first time</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="4.86">in four weeks it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.62">and there is a new study out there and</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="5.48">again we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="5.88">a very long time a new study documents</text>
  <text start="369.29" dur="4.93">the Bleak plight of Americans who have</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="5.01">been unemployed for more than six months</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="6.9">so what they&amp;#39;re saying is if you go past</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="6.42">that six-month period only eleven</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="5.82">percent of you are going to actually</text>
  <text start="383.46" dur="5.85">find a full-time job the rest of you you</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="6">have no chance of finding anything why</text>
  <text start="389.31" dur="7.35">because there are no jobs out there and</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="5.67">the long-term jobless number 3.8 million</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="4.53">or thirty-seven percent of all</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="4.71">unemployed Americans are showing that</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="4.83">the long-term unemployed are more than</text>
  <text start="403.32" dur="4.77">twice as likely to stop looking for a</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.35">job than to find one</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="3.87">up to two million Americans who would</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="4.17">have been benefited from the emergency</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="4.53">benefits program again we know lost</text>
  <text start="414.54" dur="3.48">their assistance and as this continually</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="2.88">goes on will be 2 million there will be</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="4.56">three million there&amp;#39;ll be four million</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="4.71">will be five million and again when they</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="4.32">were getting this assistance remember</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="5.07">this is the long-term emergency benefits</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="5.13">when they were receiving this what you</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="6.03">had to do each I think was every two</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="4.83">weeks what you need to do is show that</text>
  <text start="435.18" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re looking for a job you have to</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="5.04">write down all the jobs that you apply</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="4.44">to where you send your resume and again</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="4.739">these people have been past the</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="4.53">six-month time period so they are never</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="5.311">going to find a job why because those</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="6.21">jobs aren&amp;#39;t out there this is what the</text>
  <text start="451.95" dur="5.969">reality is the unemployment is nowhere</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="5.46">near six point seven percent it is much</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="4.141">closer to thirty to thirty seven percent</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="6.42">of course depending on the calculation</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="8.22">you loot you use now we understand that</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="4.799">housing is imploding on itself and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="3.54">been talking about this a long time</text>
  <text start="471.539" dur="3.871">we&amp;#39;ve been taking it step by step every</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="4.409">single month and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="6.3">this and guess what it is completely</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="5.431">true it is not going to be it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="3.63">going to turn out well at all for</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="4.259">housing especially those people who are</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="4.5">flipping who are speculators they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="4.171">going to lose their shirts just like</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="4.32">they did in 2008 and people are just</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="4.11">going to run from these homes and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.16" dur="4.95">seeing it happen right now because what</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="6.029">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that twenty percent of</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="5.61">buyers unto the age of 33 the prime</text>
  <text start="502.229" dur="5.551">group of first-time buyers delayed their</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="6.419">purchases because of debt because of</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="5.939">student loan debt can&amp;#39;t finding the job</text>
  <text start="511.139" dur="4.741">because I have this debt and I can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="513.719" dur="4.141">it off so the last thing I&amp;#39;m going to do</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="4.469">is I&amp;#39;m going the last thing I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="4.47">do is go out and buy a home and again</text>
  <text start="520.349" dur="5.011">we&amp;#39;ve said this before the youth of</text>
  <text start="522.33" dur="5.73">America at this point is not going to be</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="6">the foundation and it&amp;#39;s not and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="6.33">not going to help bring this housing the</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="4.44">economy out of what is coming and of</text>
  <text start="534.39" dur="5.16">course we know what&amp;#39;s coming it is</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="5.79">called the collapse now bank of america</text>

  <text start="550.71" dur="5.31">transactions in February up from thirty</text>
  <text start="553.53" dur="5.09">three percent in January and thirty two</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="5.55">percent in February of 2013</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="4.84">seventy-three percent of investors paid</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="4.8">in cash because this is all the money</text>

  <text start="571.14" dur="5.22">them go out and buy these houses in cash</text>
  <text start="573" dur="7.62">because do you really think the American</text>
  <text start="576.36" dur="6.93">people have cash to purchase homes no</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t they take out mortgages but</text>
  <text start="583.29" dur="3.32">guess what they&amp;#39;re not taking out</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="4.53">mortgages because mortgages are</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="5.35">imploding they&amp;#39;re declining by sixty-six</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="4.35">percent this is why we see the mortgage</text>
  <text start="591.96" dur="4.62">department is closing and laying off</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="4.89">thousands upon thousands of people and I</text>
  <text start="596.58" dur="5.16">mentioned this many many times back in</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="7.56">september-october flowing into this year</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="6.6">all we&amp;#39;re seeing is layoffs in these</text>

  <text start="614.48" dur="6.91">again this is not going to turn out well</text>
  <text start="618.66" dur="4.62">and this goes on to say it&amp;#39;s clear there</text>
  <text start="621.39" dur="4.14">are other people who would like to buy a</text>
  <text start="623.28" dur="4.68">home that are not in the market because</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="5.25">of debt issues so we can expect a</text>
  <text start="627.96" dur="3.87">lingering impact of delayed home by well</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;m going to tell you it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>

  <text start="2001.409" dur="5.16">and border protection but a lot of the</text>

  <text start="2024.17" dur="6.1">military tactics discipline and it seems</text>
  <text start="2028.44" dur="6.06">like they are just being turned into</text>

  <text start="2034.5" dur="5.61">there and we understand that the p5 plus</text>
  <text start="2036.36" dur="5.55">1 deal is going forward and of course</text>
  <text start="2040.11" dur="3.9">this is an illusion and of course we</text>
  <text start="2041.91" dur="4.41">understand that this agreement that the</text>
  <text start="2044.01" dur="4.38">president has made with all the other</text>
  <text start="2046.32" dur="4.29">countries it is under lock and key</text>

  <text start="2050.61" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s unclassified but only a handful of</text>
  <text start="2053.22" dur="4.53">people are actually allowed to read the</text>
  <text start="2055.59" dur="3.9">details of this plan you have to sign in</text>
  <text start="2057.75" dur="6.84">they have to take your fingerprint your</text>
  <text start="2059.49" dur="8.07">blood your DNA and they keep track of</text>
  <text start="2064.59" dur="4.86">who is actually seeing the details of</text>
  <text start="2067.56" dur="3.63">the plan but Russia was out there saying</text>
  <text start="2069.45" dur="3.63">listen and I don&amp;#39;t know if this is</text>
  <text start="2071.19" dur="3.87">absolutely true because it&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="2073.08" dur="4.47">of the Associated Press and this could</text>
  <text start="2075.06" dur="4.53">be some type of propaganda a senior</text>
  <text start="2077.55" dur="4.65">Russian diplomat signaled a possible</text>
  <text start="2079.59" dur="4.77">shift wednesday in Russia&amp;#39;s position on</text>
  <text start="2082.2" dur="3.449">the ongoing Iranian nuclear talks amid</text>
  <text start="2084.36" dur="3.72">tensions with the United States and</text>
  <text start="2085.649" dur="4.411">other Western countries now the only</text>
  <text start="2088.08" dur="3.39">thing I can think of is they might say</text>
  <text start="2090.06" dur="2.49">listen we know exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2091.47" dur="3.57">doing they&amp;#39;re trying to get into the</text>
  <text start="2092.55" dur="5.25">bank&amp;#39;s this has nothing to do with peace</text>
  <text start="2095.04" dur="4.92">and they&amp;#39;re going to expose what the</text>
  <text start="2097.8" dur="4.35">government is actually doing or this is</text>
  <text start="2099.96" dur="6.66">propaganda where they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="2102.15" dur="6.54">Russia on the deal not working out so</text>
  <text start="2106.62" dur="4.5">this way they can go in and strike and</text>
  <text start="2108.69" dur="4.2">we understand that Israel said that you</text>
  <text start="2111.12" dur="3.57">know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re building up their</text>
  <text start="2112.89" dur="4.56">forces they&amp;#39;re ready to strike Iran</text>
  <text start="2114.69" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re putting money aside to strike</text>
  <text start="2117.45" dur="3.72">Iran and they understand they have to do</text>
  <text start="2119.88" dur="4.5">without the United States because</text>
  <text start="2121.17" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re talking peace with Iran right</text>
  <text start="2124.38" dur="6.66">now and again this is in preparation for</text>
  <text start="2128.37" dur="5.22">something much larger and we all</text>
  <text start="2131.04" dur="4.26">understand what this is because we have</text>
  <text start="2133.59" dur="5.46">to remember the United States does have</text>
  <text start="2135.3" dur="5.73">a pact an agreement with Israel so if</text>
  <text start="2139.05" dur="4.98">something does happen</text>
  <text start="2141.03" dur="6.06">again will Israel just fly into Iran and</text>
  <text start="2144.03" dur="4.92">bomb them no I believe there will be</text>
  <text start="2147.09" dur="5.01">some type of incident if this really</text>
  <text start="2148.95" dur="6.06">does occur and they will show that Iran</text>
  <text start="2152.1" dur="5.82">fired at them somehow someway and we are</text>
  <text start="2155.01" dur="4.89">seeing you know missiles being shot into</text>
  <text start="2157.92" dur="4.86">Israel and they say listen it came from</text>
  <text start="2159.9" dur="4.14">Syria this is why we flew in and we bomb</text>
  <text start="2162.78" dur="2.67">their missile base where they were</text>
  <text start="2164.04" dur="3.72">holding all the missiles from Russia</text>
  <text start="2165.45" dur="4.77">which you know and the missiles that</text>
  <text start="2167.76" dur="4.74">were shot into Israel I think they were</text>
  <text start="2170.22" dur="4.8">like 60 of them most of them landed just</text>
  <text start="2172.5" dur="5.73">in the desert and no one really got hurt</text>
  <text start="2175.02" dur="5.01">and if you look closely every single</text>
  <text start="2178.23" dur="4.95">time missiles are being shot into Israel</text>
  <text start="2180.03" dur="6.42">they always seem to be facing the desert</text>
  <text start="2183.18" dur="9.96">where nobody is and this happens quite a</text>
  <text start="2186.45" dur="9.66">bit now right now u.s. NATO forces the</text>
  <text start="2193.14" dur="5.73">opposition in Syria they are completely</text>
  <text start="2196.11" dur="6.72">losing the battle in Syria the Syrian</text>
  <text start="2198.87" dur="6.87">army under Assad has been pushing them</text>
  <text start="2202.83" dur="6.09">back they&amp;#39;ve been taking over town after</text>
  <text start="2205.74" dur="5.7">town and they are completely losing and</text>
  <text start="2208.92" dur="5.13">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this build-up</text>
  <text start="2211.44" dur="5.49">to some type of an event right now this</text>
  <text start="2214.05" dur="5.25">is why the embassies and the diplomats</text>
  <text start="2216.93" dur="4.53">were asked to leave because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2219.3" dur="4.95">if Assad pushes the opposition</text>
  <text start="2221.46" dur="4.95">completely out of the country what do</text>
  <text start="2224.25" dur="5.4">they have now the opposites in the</text>
  <text start="2226.41" dur="6.66">opposition is out Assad has taken</text>
  <text start="2229.65" dur="5.49">control of his country and what is the</text>
  <text start="2233.07" dur="3.45">u.s. the central banker is going to do</text>
  <text start="2235.14" dur="3.75">at this point so they cannot let this</text>
  <text start="2236.52" dur="5.61">happen and they realize this and the</text>
  <text start="2238.89" dur="4.83">opposition right now is really losing</text>
  <text start="2242.13" dur="5.04">and again we matter remember these</text>
  <text start="2243.72" dur="8.1">elections are coming up in mid-2014 as</text>
  <text start="2247.17" dur="7.8">if they vote a Sean back in it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2251.82" dur="6.33">to show the people that it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2254.97" dur="6.15">show the world that the people of Syria</text>
  <text start="2258.15" dur="6.59">are for Assad and this is going to make</text>
  <text start="2261.12" dur="7.53">it very difficult so from now until</text>
  <text start="2264.74" dur="6.64">summertime the mid-2014 before the</text>
  <text start="2268.65" dur="6.21">elections the united states the central</text>
  <text start="2271.38" dur="4.86">bankers need to create some type of</text>
  <text start="2274.86" dur="3.27">event or they&amp;#39;re just going to lose</text>
  <text start="2276.24" dur="4.17">their opportunity and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="2278.13" dur="5.34">to let this happen and this is why we</text>
  <text start="2280.41" dur="5.37">see everything going on at this point if</text>
  <text start="2283.47" dur="4.41">we look around we see the incremental</text>
  <text start="2285.78" dur="4.44">sanctions on Russia and again all the</text>
  <text start="2287.88" dur="4.65">players are the same no matter which way</text>
  <text start="2290.22" dur="3.81">they go ahead and do it again the</text>
  <text start="2292.53" dur="4.02">president is out there talking about</text>
  <text start="2294.03" dur="4.47">recovery and how great things are the</text>
  <text start="2296.55" dur="4.32">Fed told us that we have a strong base</text>
  <text start="2298.5" dur="3.93">for recovery unemployment coming down</text>
  <text start="2300.87" dur="3.6">they keep telling us that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2304.47" dur="4.92">didn&amp;#39;t even tell you what jobs are being</text>
  <text start="2307.17" dur="3.03">created what are these great jobs that</text>
  <text start="2309.39" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re being created they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2310.2" dur="6.39">tell you this they can&amp;#39;t because they</text>
  <text start="2312.63" dur="8.31">have no proof and all of this is being</text>
  <text start="2316.59" dur="6.81">played into covering up this collapse</text>
  <text start="2320.94" dur="5.61">and we see if we look at all the</text>
  <text start="2323.4" dur="6.18">indicators in Ukraine the sanctions with</text>
  <text start="2326.55" dur="7.74">Russia the Iran deal the build up of</text>
