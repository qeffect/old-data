  <text start="282.32" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re going to erase all of this and</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="4.11">manipulate the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="4.8">even lower because they have to keep</text>

  <text start="303.26" dur="3.659">no they&amp;#39;re not going to admit it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="5.37">going to say you know it&amp;#39;s a bump in the</text>
  <text start="306.919" dur="7.051">road this is temporary the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="310.58" dur="6.559">to start printing currency once again</text>
  <text start="313.97" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re going to see QE blah blah blah and</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="3.791">everything will be pumped up once again</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="4.68">but that&amp;#39;s just going to make the</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="5.82">situation even worse and as we go down</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="5.04">the line they will never admit it</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="6.09">because why if they do admit it</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="7.83">everything they&amp;#39;ve told us prior was a</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="7.16">lie so this what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="6.84">is they&amp;#39;re setting it up to blame</text>
  <text start="340" dur="6.52">another group or another country this is</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="5.52">their main objective at this point now</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="7.38">we see us import prices they have</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="7.05">tumbled for 21 months in a row and what</text>
  <text start="353.9" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is China is</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="6.78">exporting deflation at the fastest pace</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="8.579">since 2009 the Baltic Dry Index right</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="6.509">now remains at 579 they didn&amp;#39;t drop</text>

  <text start="369.349" dur="4.231">surprised if it drops tomorrow but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="371.599" dur="3.991">have to watch and say now I&amp;#39;m starting</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="5.19">to see something very interesting the</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="6.02">demonization of gold and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="5.67">to link gold to terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="5.02">criminals and whatnot and I see these</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="4.5">new stories that are coming out now and</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="5.45">we know the Fed is continually telling</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="6.63">the world that gold is a barbarous relic</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s not real money it&amp;#39;s nothing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="4.17">brick of yellow nothing don&amp;#39;t even own</text>
  <text start="397.46" dur="4.62">it and that tells you should be owning a</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="4.859">lot of it it&amp;#39;s funny because Russia and</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="4.5">China they&amp;#39;re loading up on it other</text>
  <text start="404.599" dur="3.781">central banks in different countries are</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="3.41">loading up on it countries are</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="5.099">diversifying getting out of the dollar</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.92">loading up on gold but what we see right</text>
  <text start="413.479" dur="5.16">now and this should be another signal</text>
  <text start="415.91" dur="4.95">letting you know where we are headed at</text>
  <text start="418.639" dur="4.56">this point they&amp;#39;re saying that terrorist</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="6.989">organizations have been switching to</text>
  <text start="423.199" dur="7.111">elicit gold trade from nacar tax to fund</text>
  <text start="427.849" dur="3.631">their activities George Mason University</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="2.46">terrorism</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="4.65">transnational crime and corruption</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="6.38">center director Louis Shelly said this</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="5.55">is what terrorists are doing right now</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="4">they have enormous flexibility and</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="4.77">ability to switch between sources of</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="9.96">revenue there is now a large illicit</text>
  <text start="446.45" dur="8.73">trade in gold and she is saying that</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="5.07">criminals terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re using this to fund their</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="7.2">operations so those people that are</text>
  <text start="460.67" dur="7.08">dealing in gold be warned that you could</text>
  <text start="465.38" dur="6.03">be linked to a terrorist and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.75" dur="6.75">found with gold on you maybe you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="471.41" dur="4.95">terrorist and it&amp;#39;s very interesting how</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="5.1">these stories are starting to come out</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="4.89">now this is another signal because what</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="4.95">happens is when we start moving into</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="5.67">this period of a collapse scenario we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.55" dur="4.95">going to see more and more stories come</text>
  <text start="486.92" dur="4.68">out and how gold is not good criminals</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="6.41">use it just like cash criminals drug</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="6.63">dealers use cash and this is another</text>
  <text start="495.91" dur="4.18">flashing red signal letting us know that</text>
  <text start="498.23" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to this</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="4.98">collapse if you notice gold was brought</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="3.63">down a little bit but they can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="4.35">it down that much tomorrow I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.96" dur="5.01">going to skyrocket once again and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="4.38">getting more and more difficult for them</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="4.85">to suppress gold and when they lose</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="8.01">control it&amp;#39;s just going to skyrocket and</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="7.33">this is why we are watching this because</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="4.59">there will come a point when you see</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="3.99">gold going up and up and up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="5.16">bringing it down boom by maybe five or</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="6.33">ten dollars you know right there that</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re in the end game means the next</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="5.57">month or two you won&amp;#39;t even be able to</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="7.13">get gold the price is going to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="540.04" dur="7.6">most likely they&amp;#39;ll run out of gold and</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="6.87">if you don&amp;#39;t have it you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="7.07">get it and when this happens the</text>
  <text start="550.48" dur="7.48">collapse will be around the corner and</text>
  <text start="554.71" dur="5.74">this is why you need to be prepared with</text>
  <text start="557.96" dur="3.96">gold silver you should have some cash on</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="4.22">hand should have a weapon to protect</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="4.97">your family should have toiletries food</text>

  <text start="569.38" dur="4.79">we&amp;#39;re going to see people rush to the</text>
  <text start="571.48" dur="4.56">markets it&amp;#39;s going to be complete chaos</text>
  <text start="574.17" dur="4.44">because people are not going to know</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="4.5">what happened first we&amp;#39;ll be in shock</text>
  <text start="578.61" dur="3.85">then they&amp;#39;re going to realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="3.81">going on and they&amp;#39;re going to realize</text>
  <text start="582.46" dur="3.48">that the dollars continually losing</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="2.85">their value they&amp;#39;re going to go to the</text>

  <text start="689.23" dur="6.5">case because as we know insurance costs</text>
  <text start="691.93" dur="6.45">are skyrocketing 12 of the 23 coops are</text>
  <text start="695.73" dur="6.94">non-existent they lost a lot of</text>

  <text start="715.87" dur="4.29">officials on their boards of directors</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="5.67">and make it easier to attract outside</text>
  <text start="720.16" dur="7.65">investors this move makes it possible</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="8.82">for state bailouts and of course he just</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="6.36">likes to change things on the fly now</text>
  <text start="731.98" dur="5.55">there was a major court ruling today by</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="7.17">judge rosemary Collyer she was appointed</text>
  <text start="737.53" dur="5.13">by president george w bush and she said</text>
  <text start="741.34" dur="4.26">the administration does not have the</text>
  <text start="742.66" dur="5.82">power to spend money on cost-sharing</text>
  <text start="745.6" dur="6.03">reduction payments to insurers without</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="6.15">an appropriation from Congress she</text>
  <text start="751.63" dur="5.49">stated her ruling but the administration</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="4.41">can appeal the decision now there are</text>
  <text start="757.12" dur="4.2">billions and billions of dollars at</text>
  <text start="759.04" dur="3.81">issue right now for because they it</text>
  <text start="761.32" dur="5.72">falls under the cost-sharing reduction</text>
  <text start="762.85" dur="8.52">payments and what this really is is that</text>
  <text start="767.04" dur="6.94">Obamacare will pay insurance companies</text>
  <text start="771.37" dur="4.08">so they can reduce out-of-pocket costs</text>
  <text start="773.98" dur="4.62">such as deductibles for low-income</text>
  <text start="775.45" dur="5.55">people on Obama care plans now the</text>
  <text start="778.6" dur="3.96">administration argued it did not need an</text>
  <text start="781" dur="2.7">appropriation from Congress because the</text>
  <text start="782.56" dur="2.7">funds were already permanently</text>
  <text start="783.7" dur="3.84">appropriated by Obamacare in the same</text>
  <text start="785.26" dur="4.52">section as the laws better known tax</text>
  <text start="787.54" dur="4.89">credits that help people Ford coverage</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="5.23">however the judge ruled that the section</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="4.59">only appropriated funds for tax credits</text>
  <text start="795.01" dur="4.23">and said the cost-sharing reductions</text>
  <text start="797.02" dur="4.26">require a separate congressional</text>
  <text start="799.24" dur="5.49">appropriation which the administration</text>
  <text start="801.28" dur="6.3">does not currently have and she said</text>
  <text start="804.73" dur="6.96">these the such an appropriation cannot</text>
  <text start="807.58" dur="7.05">be inferred so her ruling does make</text>
  <text start="811.69" dur="4.59">sense and first of all most of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="814.63" dur="5.13">is unconstitutional anyhow we know the</text>
  <text start="816.28" dur="4.83">judge judge roberts was bribed because</text>
  <text start="819.76" dur="3.99">it was completely against it and then</text>
  <text start="821.11" dur="4.41">one day he woke up said okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="823.75" dur="4.68">constitutional and left the country for</text>
  <text start="825.52" dur="4.2">two weeks but of course what obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="3.81">going to do is going to take this to a</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="5.369">higher court make sure they have a judge</text>
  <text start="832.24" dur="6.09">that is being blackmailed and the rule</text>
  <text start="835.089" dur="7.25">in his favor now if they can&amp;#39;t blackmail</text>
  <text start="838.33" dur="8.629">a judge this could mean the end of</text>
  <text start="842.339" dur="8.111">Obamacare because so far Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="846.959" dur="5.531">not working out it is not a benefit for</text>
  <text start="850.45" dur="5.389">people and if you have to keep changing</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="8.43">the laws on the fly which is completely</text>
  <text start="855.839" dur="8.711">unconstitutional this tells you right</text>
  <text start="860.92" dur="7.859">there this is not for the people</text>
