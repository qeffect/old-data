  <text start="42.77" dur="4.77">been taken to the next level let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="45.98" dur="4.56">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="47.54" dur="4.26">financial news now out in greece it</text>
  <text start="50.54" dur="4.29">seems like they&amp;#39;re getting very very</text>
  <text start="51.8" dur="5.28">close to a bailout agreement but there</text>
  <text start="54.83" dur="4.56">is a problem with this entire thing now</text>
  <text start="57.08" dur="4.409">as we know bringing on more debt is not</text>
  <text start="59.39" dur="4.38">going to spur economic growth it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="61.489" dur="6.981">going to help the people and the initial</text>
  <text start="63.77" dur="8.76">plan that this rests on is basically</text>
  <text start="68.47" dur="5.83">from their initial forecasts and their</text>
  <text start="72.53" dur="4.14">initial forecast or null and void at</text>
  <text start="74.3" dur="5.25">this point because right now they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="76.67" dur="5.699">strict capital controls the banks are</text>
  <text start="79.55" dur="6.569">doing terribly businesses are closing or</text>
  <text start="82.369" dur="7.651">starrett e is worse and when we look at</text>
  <text start="86.119" dur="6.75">this bailout agreement it is absolutely</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="5.099">terrible the Greek government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.869" dur="4.95">going to surrender their powers over</text>
  <text start="95.119" dur="6.411">vast areas of their economic and social</text>
  <text start="97.819" dur="7.231">policy making to the eurozone creditors</text>
  <text start="101.53" dur="6.49">under the new terms agreed for the</text>
  <text start="105.05" dur="5.25">three-year bailout the 29 page of</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="5.61">conditions concede ultimate authority</text>
  <text start="110.3" dur="5.909">over much of Greek policymaking to the</text>
  <text start="113.63" dur="4.799">eurozone and establish a system of</text>
  <text start="116.209" dur="6.05">quarterly reviews and then reforms by</text>
  <text start="118.429" dur="6.571">the troika of institutions so basically</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="4.78">they just lost their sovereignty they</text>
  <text start="125" dur="4.289">just handed everything over to the</text>
  <text start="127.039" dur="4.891">creditors and said we give that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="6.501">basically what tsipras just did unless</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="8.81">something changes at this point Greece</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="9.76">just basically said forget it we give</text>
  <text start="140.74" dur="8.109">now out in the eurozone things are not</text>
  <text start="145.55" dur="6.93">getting better they&amp;#39;re getting worse we</text>
  <text start="148.849" dur="6.931">understand everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="6.03">feel this ripple effect of the collapse</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="5.39">and we see in the eurozone the</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.1">industrial output in the 19 countries</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.5">has fallen</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="7.53">it is not doing well Germany France</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="6.42">Italy all declining at this point the UK</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="5.37">there are a number of unemployed people</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="6.87">in the UK rose by 1.85 million for the</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="6.78">period of april to june a rise of 25,000</text>
  <text start="179.96" dur="8.01">from the previous quarter the figure has</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="8.49">risen for two consecutive months for the</text>
  <text start="187.97" dur="5.82">first time in two years the office of</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="4.25">national statistics said the most recent</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="5.7">figures also showed a slowdown in</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="5.89">earnings growth so we have been seeing</text>
  <text start="199.49" dur="4.38">this now in the united states throughout</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="6.33">many of the european countries spreading</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="8.01">to UK and canada and it will spread this</text>
  <text start="208.25" dur="5.61">whole thing is a domino you knock the</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="5.06">first one down they all start to fall</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="6.349">and this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="6.49">here in the United States Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="6.941">his administration the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="8.22">bankers they&amp;#39;re telling us that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="7.02">created 10 million new jobs they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.649">created them of course during the</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="3.78">non-existent recovery and they want you</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="3">to believe that everything is absolutely</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="5.28">fine because we created all these</text>
  <text start="239.299" dur="6.66">fantastic jobs in fact the US government</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="5.52">own numbers right now show that the</text>
  <text start="245.959" dur="6.931">total number of employed Americans has</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="6.989">really fallen by 3 million over the span</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="7.77">in the spite of the population growth</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="8.011">over the last six and a half years so</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="4.62">what are they talking about yes they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="5.04">created a lot of part-time jobs but</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="8.72">we&amp;#39;ve lost full-time incredible jobs</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="7.47">full-time manufacturing dog jobs and</text>
  <text start="274" dur="3.84">basically they&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="3.96">statistics to convince us that</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="6.19">everything is fine but when we really</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="7.11">look at this information it isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="7.11">velocity of money which is the heartbeat</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="8.16">of the US economy has plummeted far</text>
  <text start="291.14" dur="5.92">lower than at any time in the 56 year</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="3.58">history</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="5.97">this just doesn&amp;#39;t show a dying economy</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="8.46">it&amp;#39;s showing a dead economy this is the</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="8.52">circulation of money then we have the</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="8.67">energy consumption now the picture is</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="8.61">really clear on this the overall US</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="9.75">energy consumption peaked in 2007 and it</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="7.65">has been falling ever since the official</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="4.83">gasoline consumption has been plummeting</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="7.05">for seven years several years growing</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="9.41">economies use more energy shrinking</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="11.22">economies use less energy and guess what</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="8.14">we&amp;#39;re shrinking the US government has</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="4.589">now provided us with a definitive</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="6">picture on us wages during the first</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="6.541">quarter of this year the US wage growth</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="6.78">during the entire recovery us wages were</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="8.1">still falling us wages have been falling</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="7.83">every quarter of this recovery right now</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="5.76">there are millions fewer Americans who</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="4.86">are now employed their wages have been</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="4.8">falling for every quarter of the</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="5.76">recovery and they also are now working</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="7.58">fewer hours growing economies create</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="7.2">more jobs shrinking economies lose jobs</text>
  <text start="383.45" dur="6.25">strong economies have rising wages weak</text>
  <text start="386.76" dur="5.87">economies have falling wages once again</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="7.29">we see the supposed US recovery is</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="7.45">basically fake phony and false and when</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="7.97">we look at what&amp;#39;s really going on in the</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="8.64">market we see Macy&amp;#39;s came out and said</text>

  <text start="440.73" dur="3.78">and more layoffs and you have to</text>
  <text start="442.41" dur="4.2">remember the US government got rid of</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="5.22">their department that reports on layoffs</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="6.75">back in 2013 because of budget cuts so</text>
