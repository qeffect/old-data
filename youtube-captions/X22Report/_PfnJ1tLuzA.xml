  <text start="360.12" dur="4.349">all the newscasters you know talking</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="4.74">about you know you don&amp;#39;t need us to tell</text>
  <text start="364.469" dur="5.581">you that gas prices are back on the rise</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="6.449">now he had I don&amp;#39;t know probably roughly</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="7.409">about 15 different news stations saying</text>
  <text start="373.499" dur="7.82">the exact same thing so when you look at</text>
  <text start="377.459" dur="7.02">this it&amp;#39;s hilarious but the news is</text>
  <text start="381.319" dur="4.9">scripted and everyone is reading the</text>
  <text start="384.479" dur="4.02">same script it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re robots and</text>
  <text start="386.219" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re programmed to say the same exact</text>
  <text start="388.499" dur="4.95">thing so if they&amp;#39;re saying the same</text>
  <text start="390.689" dur="4.59">exact thing with gas prices you know</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="5.96">everything else that they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="395.279" dur="9.42">being controlled being controlled by who</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="7.271">governments coming you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="2.531">telling us what the government wants us</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="4.27">to hear</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="7.29">and this is what I take away from this</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="5.07">and it&amp;#39;s funny because so does conan</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="3.32">o&amp;#39;brien because at the end he goes what</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="5.07">is this a coincidence i mean because</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="9.22">really can that many stations say the</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="8.67">exact same words I mean word-for-word it</text>
  <text start="427.06" dur="8.07">and you know it&amp;#39;s there are no</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="7.29">coincidences all right moving on I seem</text>
  <text start="435.13" dur="6.72">like I always have to come back to gun</text>
  <text start="437.05" dur="8.13">confiscation and Feinstein and it just</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="7.62">blows my mind I mean I was watching her</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="6.57">on an interview and I don&amp;#39;t think she</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.23">really understands the Constitution I</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="3.66">really don&amp;#39;t think she understands the</text>
  <text start="453.7" dur="4.74">Second Amendment yes she talks about</text>
  <text start="455.41" dur="6.09">herself how she&amp;#39;s a 20-year senator she</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.25">was a mayor for nine years and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="4.71">have to lecture her and she&amp;#39;s seen what</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="6.09">guns have done and the damage they can</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="6.63">cause and the killing but she never</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="5.88">mentions how guns save lives never once</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="6.06">and I don&amp;#39;t think she understands the</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="7.86">Second Amendment again the right to bear</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="7.26">arms shall not be infringed upon you</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="8.21">cannot limp I mean they put it shall not</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="9.57">infringe be infringed upon I mean</text>
  <text start="491.73" dur="6.91">infringed means you can&amp;#39;t limit no laws</text>
  <text start="495.73" dur="4.68">you cannot limit you cannot limit our</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="4.71">weapons you cannot limit our ammunition</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="5.79">you cannot limit our armaments I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="5.28">think she gets that I don&amp;#39;t think most</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="4.62">of the people in government and where</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="5.07">are all the constitutional lawyers I</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="5.31">mean this is such a simple sentence</text>
  <text start="513.7" dur="4.83">where is everyone everyone all these</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="6.27">constitutional lawyers and that they</text>
  <text start="518.53" dur="7.23">should be picketing and going against</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="5.52">this because this completely is against</text>
  <text start="525.76" dur="5.73">the Constitution it&amp;#39;s almost like saying</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="6.06">let&amp;#39;s limit the First Amendment for free</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="4.89">speech you&amp;#39;re only allowed to speak</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="6.66">freely in your bathroom but no other</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="6.09">place no you can&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="3.69">but you know if you said that to someone</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="3.42">people be like no you can&amp;#39;t do that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.33" dur="3.71">the you know First Amendment you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="6.36">allowed to talk freely wherever you want</text>
  <text start="548.04" dur="7.96">so to me I don&amp;#39;t I mean there&amp;#39;s only one</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="6.39">reason for gun confiscation and is that</text>
  <text start="556" dur="4.65">that is when everything goes sour is to</text>
  <text start="558.64" dur="5.58">keep us from having some type of</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="7.08">revolution or fighting back and that</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="5.88">really is the only reason okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="3.99">move on to the next I know I keep</text>
  <text start="570.1" dur="5.49">repeating myself about these cyber</text>
