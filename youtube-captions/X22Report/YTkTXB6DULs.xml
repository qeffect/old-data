  <text start="109.02" dur="5.73">14 months of finding absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="4.951">now Muller he&amp;#39;s been investigating</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.2">digging and digging and digging and he</text>

  <text start="126.509" dur="2.85">that he&amp;#39;s been shuffling around but this</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="2.82">has nothing to do with Trump has nothing</text>
  <text start="129.359" dur="2.371">to do with collusion has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="130.859" dur="4.231">with anything actually</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="6.39">now Mueller his star witness against</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="6.269">Trump well he&amp;#39;s been caught partying</text>
  <text start="138.12" dur="5.19">with close friend Bill Clinton on an</text>
  <text start="141.359" dur="7.141">island which people call pedophile</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="7.26">Island now Mueller was relying on mr.</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="6.39">Nader who was an advisor to the Crown</text>
  <text start="150.57" dur="7.229">Prince of Abu Dhabi the de facto ruler</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="8.39">of United Arab Emirates because he was</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="9.06">trying to find out if money came from</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="6.489">United Arab Emirates and found its way</text>
  <text start="166.859" dur="5.22">to the Trump campaign which would be</text>
  <text start="169.769" dur="5.31">illegal now this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="172.079" dur="4.981">Russian collusion once again but they</text>
  <text start="175.079" dur="4.801">were trying to figure out something</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="8.91">where they can get Trump the problem is</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="7.32">that Nader has been caught and Mueller</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="3.56">should be asking Nader</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="5.759">what were you doing on the island</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="5.76">partying with Bill Clinton and this</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="6.151">island is known as the pedophile island</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="6.37">so the whole thing seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="4.47">completely falling apart and remember</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="5.1">the Clintons have been caught helping</text>
  <text start="203.58" dur="6.659">fund the Trump dossier which helped</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="6.24">launch Mueller&amp;#39;s probe so the whole</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="6">thing is going absolutely nowhere and</text>
  <text start="213" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart we see the</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="5.761">deep state they are pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="5.7">now what they&amp;#39;ve tried in the past was</text>
  <text start="222" dur="5.31">they tried to create something called</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.75">fake news but if backfired because Trump</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="4.98">took it on and started calling the</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="6.3">corporate media fake news then they said</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="5.88">okay you know we will set up different</text>
  <text start="235.14" dur="5.51">parameters on YouTube and other places</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="5.73">where we can remove the monetization of</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="4.48">videos well that didn&amp;#39;t work either they</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="3.089">thought maybe they can put some of these</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="3.84">individuals out of business because they</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="3.451">don&amp;#39;t make that much money anyhow and if</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re making nothing they&amp;#39;ll go on and</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="4.07">find something else to do well if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="3.78">not making that much in the beginning</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="5.14">taking away that money is really not</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="5.16">going to do that much to you then right</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="6.44">before the latest event they went back</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="7.171">in time and they took down and gave</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="6.61">channel strikes where they were</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.159">discussing different events and they</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="3.6">said this is against our Terms and</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="5.13">policies it&amp;#39;s bullying and things like</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="4.95">that fast forward to today what they did</text>
  <text start="279.419" dur="4.141">was they started to bring down channels</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.83">give people strikes if they reset if</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="5.4">they said anything about any type of an</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.49">event and they didn&amp;#39;t show proof or</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="4.11">anything why they took it down actually</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="5.17">natural news his entire channel was</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="3.779">taken down jerome corsi his channel was</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="3.09">taken down that was brought back up</text>
  <text start="296.849" dur="4.201">Infowars we know got a couple strikes</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="5.459">but there are like many others that</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="5.91">receive strikes and their channels were</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="6.091">taking down and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="5.519">part of the new push to silence anyone</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="2.759">that is out there trying to tell a</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="4.921">different story</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="6.15">and even if these people or myself or</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="3.58">anyone is just asking questions and</text>
  <text start="319.289" dur="3.341">maybe</text>
  <text start="320.98" dur="3.12">you know looking at something just</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="3.33">asking a question maybe getting it wrong</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="3.03">but just asking a question they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="3.75">want this because it makes people think</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="4.38">and when you start using your brain you</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="3.27">have other questions and then you start</text>
  <text start="331.51" dur="3.48">looking deeper and you find other</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="4.82">information and they don&amp;#39;t want that to</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="5.79">happen and now what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re going after any video that is</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.38">considered a conspiracy video they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="2.46">saying that oh we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="345.16" dur="5.46">after those channels that are talking</text>
  <text start="346.51" dur="6.3">about flat earth or anything else that</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="3.93">they deem conspiratorial</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="3.59">but that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="354.55" dur="6.27">now they&amp;#39;re gonna be working with</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="7.09">different organizations to provide links</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="5.19">to show that why these videos are</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="4.08">completely fake they tried this with</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="4.74">fake news that didn&amp;#39;t go over very well</text>
  <text start="367.57" dur="5.73">and they&amp;#39;re gonna try different parties</text>
  <text start="370.75" dur="4.47">third party sources they haven&amp;#39;t named</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="7.62">them yet but it looks like there is a</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="9.36">push to basically stop anyone that isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="5.88">in line with the official narrative even</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="4.08">if you&amp;#39;re asking questions or pointing</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="4.08">things out you might be totally wrong</text>
  <text start="388.66" dur="5.04">and someone might have a real</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="5.4">explanation for it but even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.7" dur="6.18">asking a question you still should have</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="5.28">the right to express your viewpoint I</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="3.69">mean isn&amp;#39;t that what freedom of the</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="3.75">speech is and we know that YouTube and</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="3.51">Google and the rest they takin grants</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.02">from the government actually the</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="5.58">intelligence agencies they developed a</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="4.77">lot of this stuff so it&amp;#39;s not like oh</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re a separate private company</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re intertwined with the</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="5.16">government but we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="5.58">happening out in London we see the</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="5.61">London Mayor is trying to justify mass</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="5.79">censorship by reading mean tweets saying</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="7.02">this is why we need to remove posting</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="6.69">postings containing hate speech well</text>
  <text start="433.54" dur="5.64">again everyone is a little confused</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="6.17">about free speech here free speech is</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="8.73">any speech you might not like it but</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="7.78">it&amp;#39;s free to anyone once you start to</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="4.2">say okay you know something that hurts</text>
  <text start="450.25" dur="3.42">that group this hurts this group that</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="2.819">hurts that group this hurt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.67" dur="4.839">controlled speech</text>
  <text start="454.929" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s not free anymore if the people</text>
  <text start="458.509" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t want to hear it guess what they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="460.819" dur="3.27">turn away from it haven&amp;#39;t they been</text>
  <text start="462.709" dur="3.6">doing this with the corporate media if</text>
  <text start="464.089" dur="5.13">you don&amp;#39;t want to listen anymore you</text>
  <text start="466.309" dur="4.16">don&amp;#39;t want to view or see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.219" dur="5.13">talking about</text>
  <text start="470.469" dur="6.04">everyone turns the channel well they can</text>
  <text start="474.349" dur="4.05">do that on social media they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="476.509" dur="4.14">to believe it or they can do research</text>
  <text start="478.399" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s the beauty of free speech</text>
  <text start="480.649" dur="4.77">everyone can say what&amp;#39;s on their minds</text>
  <text start="483.709" dur="4.41">and people can look at it and say yeah</text>
  <text start="485.419" dur="4.62">fake oh let me look at this oh now I</text>
  <text start="488.119" dur="4.681">have researched it I&amp;#39;m never looking at</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="5.37">this person again they can do this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="4.829">you&amp;#39;re allowed to do this that&amp;#39;s free</text>
  <text start="495.409" dur="3.96">speech and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="497.629" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to control all of this</text>
  <text start="499.369" dur="7.11">now we know there was an event in a town</text>
  <text start="502.669" dur="8.01">in the UK where scribble circus cripple</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="5.97">was poisoned and Theresa May was out</text>
  <text start="510.679" dur="3.751">there saying oh it&amp;#39;s definitely Russia</text>
  <text start="512.449" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s definitely Russia we&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.07">going to provide any proof and proof</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="4.98">doesn&amp;#39;t mean oh the Soviet Union created</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="6.149">this nerve gas the proof is to link</text>
  <text start="522.079" dur="5.49">Russia that they actually did this but</text>
  <text start="525.649" dur="4.62">they don&amp;#39;t have the proof that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="527.569" dur="3.091">problem right now and we can see right</text>
  <text start="530.269" dur="2.851">now</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="5.52">the United Nations said Wednesday that</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="6.51">Russia was responsible for a nerve agent</text>
  <text start="536.18" dur="5.61">attack on former Russian spy in England</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="7.17">and urged the UN Security Council to</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="8.489">hold Moscow accountable nikki Haley this</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="5.459">is the US ambassador said that the</text>
  <text start="550.279" dur="5.941">United States believes that Russia is</text>
  <text start="552.259" dur="6.901">responsible for the attack and the UN</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="7.38">needs to do something and she wants an</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="7.169">emergency Security Council meeting what</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.489">I think is happening here and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="566.329" dur="4.591">this in the past where every time the</text>
  <text start="569.089" dur="6.56">deep state tries to do something with</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="8.49">the UN Russia vetoes and says no way</text>
  <text start="575.649" dur="5.201">because Russia realizes that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="579.41" dur="4.169">have evidence they have nothing to back</text>
  <text start="580.85" dur="6.799">any of their claims and all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.579" dur="6.591">asking for is evidence</text>
  <text start="587.649" dur="3.75">I think their strategic move the deep</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="7.949">state that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="591.399" dur="10.261">now is to get Russia out of the Security</text>
  <text start="598.119" dur="7.2">Council and I think what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="6.239">they launched a large-scale campaign to</text>
  <text start="605.319" dur="6.39">remove Russia from the UN Security</text>
  <text start="607.899" dur="6.87">Council this way if they are removed the</text>
  <text start="611.709" dur="5.73">deep state well they don&amp;#39;t have anyone</text>
  <text start="614.769" dur="6">blocking what they want to do they want</text>
  <text start="617.439" dur="7.2">the UN to say we can go in there it can</text>
  <text start="620.769" dur="7.76">be done and nikki Haley once again is</text>
  <text start="624.639" dur="6.69">out there speaking for the deep state I</text>
  <text start="628.529" dur="5.56">mean she did a great presentation on</text>
  <text start="631.329" dur="6.48">Iranian missile system and no one</text>
  <text start="634.089" dur="6.69">believed her so I think this whole thing</text>
  <text start="637.809" dur="7.411">with this poisoning I think their agenda</text>
  <text start="640.779" dur="8.701">is to remove Russia so they can push a</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="7.229">war on the other hand we have Trump and</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="5.459">Maness and anyone else that he can get</text>
  <text start="652.449" dur="5.61">to do what he wants them to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.939" dur="4.471">trying to create peace with these</text>
  <text start="658.059" dur="4.741">different nations just like when North</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="6.57">Korea it&amp;#39;s hard to believe madness is</text>
  <text start="662.8" dur="7.529">out in Afghanistan and man has confirmed</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="8.64">that he&amp;#39;s not in Afghanistan to have a</text>
  <text start="670.329" dur="6.38">victory militarily he sees victory</text>
  <text start="674.62" dur="6.629">coming in the form of political</text>
  <text start="676.709" dur="6.341">reconciliation and he said that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="681.249" dur="3.361">going to involve major peace talks</text>
  <text start="683.05" dur="4.07">whoever as Matt is called</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="5.25">that a bridge too far reflecting Trump&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="920.12" dur="6.9">whole thing is fake phony false it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="949.67" dur="7.94">anniversary of World War one and from</text>
  <text start="954.17" dur="7.65">what we can see is this parade might be</text>
  <text start="957.61" dur="6.52">the end of all wars and troops would be</text>
  <text start="961.82" dur="5.73">coming home I mean is this possible</text>

  <text start="971.74" dur="6.88">parade on November 11th gets the thumbs</text>
  <text start="976.49" dur="4.74">up but they&amp;#39;re not going to be using</text>
