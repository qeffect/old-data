  <text start="155.06" dur="7.66">created out of thin air anybody can do</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="8.65">that now out in Italy we are seeing</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="7.05">one of the first ballons the italian</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="7.25">banks are in serious serious trouble and</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="8.22">there are four banks that basically are</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="7">imploding on itself and what they had to</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="7.28">do to keep these banks afloat they had</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="7.92">to do balance and an Italian pensioner</text>
  <text start="185.27" dur="5.71">committed suicide over this this week he</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="4.95">hung himself after the Italian</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="4.97">government rescued the small for banks</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="5.88">and basically wiped out his life savings</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="5.35">the bailout or should say bail-in was</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.89">carried out under the principles which</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="5.58">covered cyprus&amp;#39;s bailout which is really</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="5.04">a bail-in all the stakeholders in the</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.48">bank including depositors we&amp;#39;re at risk</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="5.63">in the bank&amp;#39;s failure at this point</text>
  <text start="212.36" dur="4.65">eighteen percent of all out stoning</text>
  <text start="215" dur="5.11">outstanding loans in Italy are</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="5.41">non-performing that is an extraordinary</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="3.51">high level particularly when you</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="3.3">consider that Italy is the eighth</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="5.48">largest economy in the world and the</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="6.62">fourth in Europe so if we look at this</text>
  <text start="229.1" dur="5.889">circumstance that occurred in Italy</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="4.72">we&amp;#39;re they had to save these banks they</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="3.571">went inside the bank they took the</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="4.83">people&amp;#39;s money left them with paper</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="6.87">which is worthless which is the bank</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="5.879">stock and the pensioners at least one of</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="5.79">them said this is ridiculous I I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.769" dur="5.22">go on I can&amp;#39;t live like this and what</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing is this is going to spread</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="5.701">across the world this is just a small</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="7.83">glimpse into what is happening at this</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="6.77">point can you imagine when this economy</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="6.33">and it&amp;#39;s going to happen completely</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="6.31">crashes and falls apart and they start</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="4.26">the ballon process now for those people</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="6.68">who think oh no the baylands are not</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="10.23">going to happen remember back in 2012 in</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="8.02">November they created the first ballon</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="6.45">document the FDIC and Bank a villain</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="7.05">England created it in 2013 in the</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="5.96">beginning of that year Cyprus had a</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="7.64">ballon and then after that period</text>
  <text start="296.54" dur="8.07">we see Europe Switzerland Canada New</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="6.69">Zealand and many other countries adopt</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="4.5">the bail-in document this is all they</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="3.87">have left because most of the</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.88">government&amp;#39;s right now will not allow a</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="5.55">bail out so the only place they can get</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.73">this currency is to go into the accounts</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="5.73">this is why Christine Lagarde director</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="5.58">of the IMF is saying they need a ten</text>
  <text start="323" dur="5.91">percent wealth tax to pay off this debt</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.99">the only way to save their system is to</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="6.9">rob and steal from the people and they</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="5.19">will do it if they don&amp;#39;t get their way</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="4.88">with the wealth tax the carbon tax or</text>
  <text start="338.48" dur="5.22">any other tax that they have planned</text>
  <text start="340.69" dur="8.05">they&amp;#39;re coming directly at you and they</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="7.62">will take whatever you have now here in</text>
  <text start="348.74" dur="3.81">the United States they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="3.33">this illusion alive that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="4.14">recovery but it is really falling apart</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s becoming more and more difficult as</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="6.81">time goes on we see the Empire fed</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.16">manufacturing it beat expectations I</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="3.93">know out the corporate media the same we</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="5.34">look at beat expectations but when you</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="6.81">go from negative 7 which was expected to</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="6.78">negative 4.6 I don&amp;#39;t think this is</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="6.23">actually good they&amp;#39;re in the negative</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="6.69">range and what we&amp;#39;re looking at is that</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="6.7">Empire manufacturing has contracted for</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="6.33">five straight months in a row employment</text>
  <text start="387.17" dur="4.86">has tumbled to six year lows and we</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="6.84">haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this since</text>
  <text start="392.03" dur="8.24">2009 now this entire system is falling</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="5.67">apart and the Baltic Dry Index is</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="7.81">continually falling and during this time</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="7.25">of year we rarely see this especially</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="4.92">when we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="4.48">especially when the central bank is</text>
  <text start="413" dur="5.1">looking to raise rates when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.98">telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery it</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="6.26">makes no sense at this point and it has</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="7.65">fallen to 484 down another 24 points and</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="6.15">this is causing a huge huge problem for</text>
  <text start="427.28" dur="6.02">the dry bulk shipping companies</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="4.11">I mean the dry bulk market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="4.29">caught between a rock and a hard place</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="7.35">at the moment as the world&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="8.04">growth is lower than they anticipated it</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="6.9">is really hurting demand ship owners of</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="5.64">larger bulkers like capsizes could soon</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="6.09">opt to lay up part of their fleet or</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="6.54">even scrap some vessels of just 15 years</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="6.45">old because what do they do there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="6.66">demand right now and when they look at</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="5.46">the entire bulk shipping market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="6.72">saying there&amp;#39;s no credible anticipation</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="9.93">of the market rebounding at any time so</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="6.89">this is a huge huge problem and this is</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="4.35">spreading to the trucking industry</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="5.89">spreading to the rail industry and after</text>
