  <text start="89.36" dur="5.82">to their old tricks once again and why I</text>
  <text start="92.299" dur="6.661">say this is if we look at the UK with</text>
  <text start="95.18" dur="7.41">the EU you can see that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="6.329">their same agenda and Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="4.77">Boris Johnson he announced that a new</text>
  <text start="105.289" dur="5.22">brexit deal has been brokered between</text>
  <text start="107.36" dur="5.34">the UK and the EU he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="110.509" dur="4.351">following we&amp;#39;ve got a great new deal</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="4.68">that takes back control now Parliament</text>
  <text start="114.86" dur="4.56">should get brexit done on Saturday so we</text>
  <text start="117.38" dur="4.89">can move on to other priorities like the</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="7.229">cost of living the NHS violent crime and</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="8.01">our environment now the entire solution</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="8.011">to all of this the deal looks a lot like</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="7.23">Teresa Mays deal and it seems this is</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="5.28">why the EU is agreeing to it</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="4.74">now of course Boris Johnson has to</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="5.69">present this to Parliament what at</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="8.51">Parliament do with Teresa Mays agreement</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="7.93">voted it down now this might be his plan</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="5.5">now when we look at this these are the</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="4.679">things that they discussed Northern</text>
  <text start="156.26" dur="5.49">Ireland will remain aligned to a limited</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="3.871">set of EU rules known as notably related</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="2.13">to good</text>
  <text start="162.11" dur="4.11">this means that all applicable</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="4.11">procedures on goods will take place at</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="3.84">the point of entry into Northern Ireland</text>
  <text start="167.99" dur="3.69">and not across the island for this</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="3.72">purpose UK authorities will be in charge</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="4.5">of applying the union&amp;#39;s customs code in</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="4.38">Northern Ireland Northern Ireland will</text>
  <text start="176.18" dur="4.08">stay in the UK&amp;#39;s custom territory it</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="4.53">will therefore benefit me from the UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.86">future trade policy but Northern Ireland</text>
  <text start="182.69" dur="5.25">will also remain an entry point into the</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="4.92">single market UK authorities can apply</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="3.78">tariffs on products coming from third</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="4.32">countries so long as those Goods</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="4.71">entering North Northern Ireland are not</text>
  <text start="194.36" dur="4.59">at risk of entering our single market</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="4.65">for goods at risk of entering the single</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="4.95">market UK authorities will apply the EU</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="5.01">tariffs now Nigel Farraj is out there</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="4.41">and he&amp;#39;s saying that this dealer creed</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="6.649">that was agreed upon between Boris</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="7.11">Johnson and the EU is not a brexit deal</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="5.171">he said we&amp;#39;ve taken three and a half</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="5.34">years to get to this point if this was</text>
  <text start="217.91" dur="5.31">to be agreed we then enter into years</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="4.229">more negotiation for prize a free trade</text>
  <text start="223.22" dur="3.57">agreement which we already know we will</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="3.961">not get unless we surrender out</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="3.54">territorial fish and waters and will not</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="3.47">get unless we stay in regulatory</text>
  <text start="230.33" dur="5.07">alignment with the European Union</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="6.099">Faraj said that the deal would mean the</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="5.55">UK surrendering autonomy on making her</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="3.961">own laws on employment regulation and</text>
  <text start="240.95" dur="3.39">the environment as well as signing up</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="4.65">the country to foreign policy and</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="5.429">military policy commitments and he says</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="4.68">this looks a lot like Teresa Mays deal</text>
  <text start="249.769" dur="4.411">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="4.38">now this could be a strategy of Boris</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="4.44">Johnson present pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="4.89">deal let the EU agree upon it have</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="4.23">Parliament vote on it have him vote it</text>
  <text start="261.08" dur="3.81">down and then he moves forward with the</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="4.14">No Deal brexit we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="264.89" dur="4.86">this plays out because if they go forth</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.04">with this this I do believe is going to</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="4.71">be a huge problem for the people that</text>
  <text start="272.03" dur="4.98">have voted for the brexit but once again</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="4.68">let&amp;#39;s see how this all plays out now</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="4.02">here in the US Trump and his</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="5.07">administration they made a deal with</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="5.58">Mexico and Canada but Congress what have</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="4.44">they done they&amp;#39;ve done nothing well the</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="5.13">only thing they&amp;#39;ve done was try to push</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="5.25">all these conspiracy theories trying to</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="4.44">get Trump out of office have they voted</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="5.58">on a u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="6.12">why haven&amp;#39;t they what&amp;#39;s taking so long</text>
  <text start="299.48" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s the problem Senator McConnell</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="4.95">tweeted out the following Speaker Pelosi</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="4.44">is still blocking the u.s. MCA a major</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="3.26">deal that would create a hundred and</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="3.54">seventy six thousand new American jobs</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="4.45">Senate Democrats have filibustered</text>
  <text start="312.53" dur="4.71">defense funding and blocked a pay raise</text>
  <text start="314.96" dur="5.1">for our troops Democrats impeachment</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="6.72">obsession is blocking urgent work for</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="6.48">American families so the question is why</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="5.49">is Nancy Pelosi do nothing when it comes</text>
  <text start="326.54" dur="7.83">to the u.s. MCA well we need to remember</text>
  <text start="329.45" dur="9.87">it was Mexico and Canada that already</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="7.08">agreed and Trudeau&amp;#39;s government agreed</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.85">not to call the u.s. MCA up for a vote</text>
  <text start="341.45" dur="5.52">in the Canadian Parliament Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="5.04">waiting to see if Trudeau can win</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="5.58">reelection if Canada real extra dough on</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="3.78">October 21st Pelosi will announce that</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="4.47">the labor provisions are not strong</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="5.4">enough within the u.s. MC a deal the US</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="6.54">workers are not protected enough and she</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="5.73">is tabling any vote Pelosi will then</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="5.52">wait until after the twenty twenty</text>
  <text start="365.12" dur="7.46">election ratification of the SMC a would</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="9.089">be a boost for the u.s. and North</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="8.94">American economy do they want that no do</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="6.741">they want more Americans getting jobs no</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="6.73">more growth in the economy is</text>
  <text start="384.91" dur="6.79">politically adverse to her interest and</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="7.44">the deep state interests so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="8.01">going to go for it and what they really</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="6.8">want is they want a weakened economy so</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="5.24">they can remove Trump that&amp;#39;s the plan</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="6.31">now for Canada&amp;#39;s part of the scheme</text>
  <text start="404.95" dur="6.04">Trudeau is successfully reluctant we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="5.04">announce that Canada is waiting for the</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="6.51">u.s. to work out the USMC a labor</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="5.76">disagreements now if Trudeau loses the</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="5.61">election then Pelosi loses her partner</text>
  <text start="419.6" dur="6.48">in the plane as a consequence Canadian</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="5.96">ratification of the USMC well that will</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="6.05">go ahead and we&amp;#39;ll be outside</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="6.39">her control the deep state control why</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="6.78">do you think Obama came out of the</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="5.25">shadows and tweeted the following I was</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="5.04">proud to work with Justin Trudeau as</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.19">president he&amp;#39;s a hard-working effective</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="3.87">leader who takes on big issues like</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="3.51">climate change the world needs his</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="3.96">progressive leadership now and I hope</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="5.06">our neighbors to the north support him</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="6.66">for another term they&amp;#39;re worried that</text>
  <text start="454.47" dur="5.83">Trudeau might not get reelected and they</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="4.59">want to make sure that he stays in power</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="5.91">because he will go along with their plan</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="6.3">but I do believe the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="5.82">something to counter this and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="4.89">so funny how all of a sudden there were</text>
  <text start="472.03" dur="5.37">pictures of Trudeau that came out</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="6.63">showing him in blackface now the</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.49">Patriots plan it is working the central</text>
  <text start="480.85" dur="4.59">bank economic system created a wealth</text>
  <text start="482.89" dur="4.71">gap among the people the deep state</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="4.65">preys on this so the bottom percentage</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="3.72">depends on the government this allows</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="2.22">the deep state and the central bank to</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="3.75">enslave the people</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="7.11">Trump and the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="6.78">reversing all of this Trump&amp;#39;s by America</text>
  <text start="499.42" dur="4.83">higher American economy with the</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="5.88">tightest labor market in decades has</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="6.87">grown the wages of blue-collar workers</text>
  <text start="507.73" dur="5.88">more than any other income group out</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="6.359">there now the overall wage growth has</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="7.23">seemed to slow down in recent months but</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="5.971">hidden in this data is the surge in</text>
  <text start="520.84" dur="5.13">wages for the American blue-collar and</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="6.06">working-class who are gaining more in</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="4.95">pay than all other income groups while</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="3.65">the highest wage earners have seen</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="5.34">year-to-year wage growth four of about</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="6.25">2.5 percent the lowest income wage</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="6.71">earners have enjoyed almost double that</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="8.88">growth now this had to be done</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="7.39">Trump needs to close the wealth gap and</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="4.11">this is what he is doing remember the</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="3.3">central bank the deep state they create</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="2.16">this wealth gap because they want</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="2.37">everyone dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s where the deep state takes over</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="4.02">and if you have these individuals</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="4.26">dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="4.83">you can enslave the people yes I know</text>
  <text start="562.45" dur="5.16">through taxes you&amp;#39;re also enslaved but</text>
  <text start="564.88" dur="5.01">let&amp;#39;s take one step here at a time we</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="4.83">need to understand that Trump the</text>
  <text start="569.89" dur="3.33">Patriots they&amp;#39;re working as quickly as</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="2.45">possible</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="5.7">controlling the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="574.89" dur="8.56">removing certain blocks draining the</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="6.539">swamp battling other individuals and you</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="3.96">can see there&amp;#39;s a lot being done</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="5.88">can you imagine of all the blocks and</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="6.359">all these people wanted everything for</text>
  <text start="591.339" dur="5.701">the American people how much do you</text>
  <text start="593.769" dur="5.491">think would get done now Moody&amp;#39;s is out</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="4.979">there and they put out a report saying</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="5.49">that when looking at their 2020</text>
  <text start="602.019" dur="6.301">presidential election models early signs</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="8.31">point to Trump though the turnout is the</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="6.3">key now in the Moody&amp;#39;s report the report</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="5.279">pointed out that in order for Trump to</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="6.06">win in 2020 the voter turnout will be</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="3.781">very important and if voters were to</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="3.599">vote primarily on the basis of their</text>
  <text start="622.12" dur="4.17">pocketbooks the president would</text>
  <text start="624.279" dur="3.991">steamroll the competition taking home</text>
  <text start="626.29" dur="4.919">three hundred and fifty-one electoral</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="6.99">votes to the Democrats 180 s 187</text>
  <text start="631.209" dur="6.271">assuming average voter turnout and Trump</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="3.53">is betting on this and think about</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="3.83">everything else that he&amp;#39;s done and</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="6.28">whoever controls the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="641.31" dur="5.98">they control it all and we can see the</text>
  <text start="645.07" dur="4.59">Patriots they&amp;#39;re controlling it right</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="4.38">now now the IMF they&amp;#39;ve been out there</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="4.38">in the last couple of days and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="4.44">been talking about how the trade wars</text>
  <text start="654.04" dur="4.59">how this is affecting the global</text>

  <text start="658.63" dur="7.649">slowing everything down and the IMF they</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="6.87">kind of goofed up here they admitted</text>
  <text start="666.279" dur="7.471">that the policy that they were pushing</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="6.049">for years has led the world to the edge</text>
  <text start="673.75" dur="6">of disaster</text>
