  <text start="53.18" dur="5.46">ah and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="5.37">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.64" dur="6.809">episode 1371 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.51" dur="5.37">September 5th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="65.449" dur="5.251">the episode is the White House expands</text>
  <text start="67.88" dur="5.73">cyber war to include banks and Wall</text>
  <text start="70.7" dur="5.029">Street let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="5.16">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="75.729" dur="4.721">now it looks like Trump and Attorney</text>
  <text start="78.77" dur="4.23">General Jeff Sessions they announced</text>
  <text start="80.45" dur="5.01">that the dreamer program well it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="83" dur="4.259">to be rescinded and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="3.6">previous administration disrespected the</text>
  <text start="87.259" dur="3.661">legal process basically what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="3.87">is that this policy was implemented</text>
  <text start="90.92" dur="4.32">literally to create too great</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="4.35">controversy and legal concern after</text>
  <text start="95.24" dur="3.989">Congress rejected legislative proposals</text>
  <text start="97.28" dur="4.02">to extend similar benefits on numerous</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="4.17">occasions to this group of illegal ends</text>
  <text start="101.3" dur="4.44">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="4.561">the executive branch through the DAC a</text>
  <text start="105.74" dur="4.95">deliberately sought to achieve what the</text>
  <text start="107.96" dur="6.079">legislative branch specifically refused</text>
  <text start="110.69" dur="5.52">to authorize on multiple occasions and</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="3.971">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="4.29">yeah this is no longer going to happen</text>
  <text start="118.01" dur="4.68">anymore and I know the media outlets are</text>
  <text start="120.5" dur="4.619">out there saying you know oh we have to</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="4.89">let the dreamers the children we need to</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="5.041">have them come in but when you look at</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="5.01">this closely the media outlets are</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="5.66">touting polls which supposedly show</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="5.64">public support for the DAC a amnesty but</text>
  <text start="135.82" dur="4.479">careful polls show the public</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="4.05">overwhelmingly prefers immigration</text>
  <text start="140.299" dur="4.41">policies which help their fellow</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="4.019">Americans find good jobs and what</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="3.331">they&amp;#39;re really saying is that they want</text>
  <text start="146.299" dur="3.591">the American people to find the jobs</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="4.919">first before we give them away to</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="4.78">illegal immigrants and we can see like</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="4.171">for example NBC Paul described that</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="6.9">800,000 illegal aliens and the DEA see a</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="7.5">as children but the average age is 25</text>
  <text start="161.57" dur="4.949">years old so it&amp;#39;s really not children</text>
  <text start="164.63" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re bringing in these individuals</text>
  <text start="166.519" dur="5.25">who are around 25 years old and this was</text>
  <text start="169.73" dur="5.88">being done on purpose because remember</text>
  <text start="171.769" dur="6.78">their agenda was to bring in illegals to</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="5.25">help with voting to bring them in to</text>
  <text start="178.549" dur="3.541">help with Obamacare to bring them in</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="4.62">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="4.89">pass the TPP this was all planned this</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="2.91">is why they were doing this not</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="3.99">here in the United States but throughout</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="6.409">Europe and we could see that right now</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="7.65">those plans well they&amp;#39;re not happening</text>
  <text start="194.799" dur="6.94">now we see that the military equipment</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="4.86">that Trump and his administration said</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="6.03">okay we&amp;#39;re gonna allow law enforcement</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="7.92">to once again purchase these military</text>
  <text start="207.769" dur="6.601">weapons and we can see that basically a</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.19">lot of cities towns they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="214.37" dur="4.08">purchasing these type of weapons now</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.5">some of these weapons and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="5.759">discussed this before under Obama they</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="6.57">are weapons like grenade launchers</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="6.271">bayonets firearms with ammunition of 50</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="8.25">caliber or higher m16s</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="11.7">I mean why in the world does small towns</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="8.79">need tanks m16s m-14s grenade what in</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="6.089">the world do they need this for</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="6.3">they don&amp;#39;t unless something is going to</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="5.25">happen to be mass riots the economy is</text>
  <text start="251" dur="5.66">going to break down they need to control</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="5.46">the public and this is the only reason</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="4.87">they would need something like this and</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="4.861">we can see that this is being brought up</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="3.99">once again they&amp;#39;re allowing the local</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="3.69">police to purchase all this stuff I mean</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="3.3">think about we went over we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="3.15">this country you know hundreds and</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.38">hundreds of years there was never a</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="6.18">reason to have any of this stuff all of</text>
  <text start="273.2" dur="6.66">a sudden the police need it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="5.76">absolutely ridiculous now Putin is</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="4.47">warning the United States the Cabal let</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="4.769">listen if you&amp;#39;re going to sell lethal</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="5.55">arms to Ukraine this is going to make</text>
  <text start="287.389" dur="4.981">the situation a lot worse in the country</text>
  <text start="289.88" dur="5.25">and they&amp;#39;re saying that supplying</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="4.859">Ukraine with lethal weapons this is not</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="4.38">going to help it&amp;#39;s going to promote war</text>
  <text start="297.229" dur="4.651">well this is what the Cabal wants they</text>
  <text start="299.51" dur="5.01">want more in Ukraine they want war</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="4.83">pretty much everywhere so we can see</text>
  <text start="304.52" dur="6.81">right now they&amp;#39;re not finished just yet</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="6.15">and Putin China they all understand what</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="4.47">to push their agenda now we had nikki</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="4.38">Haley out there saying that North Korea</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="5.73">is begging for war</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="5.73">and they want strict hard sanctions on</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="5.67">North Korea and you know North Korea</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="5.79">exploded this h-bomb underground and it</text>
  <text start="328.73" dur="4.68">caused it an earthquake and Putin is out</text>
  <text start="331.28" dur="4.44">there with you Jinping saying listen if</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="5.67">we place more sanctions on North Korea</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="5.64">most likely Russia and China will veto</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="3.81">the sanctions they did this before they</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.33">vetoed whatever the United States was</text>
  <text start="342.89" dur="3.39">going to do they shot them down they</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="3.99">took control and what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="5.01">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="4.74">have some type of diplomatic approach to</text>
  <text start="351.29" dur="4.2">this they want peace talks they want all</text>
  <text start="353.42" dur="3.84">sides to come together they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="3.69">more and more sanctions where it really</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t do anything it just provokes the</text>
  <text start="359.18" dur="3.24">other country the other country is not</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="3.45">going to give up you know testing</text>
  <text start="362.42" dur="4.1">missiles testing their nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re just going to try to basically</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="6.45">get those operational so they can</text>
  <text start="370.46" dur="5.61">protect themselves we see South Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="4.69">moon jae-in well he&amp;#39;s kind of stuck</text>
  <text start="376.07" dur="3.84">because he wants a diplomatic approach</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="3.6">but we can see the Cabal with all of</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="3.36">this happening with all these events</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="5.19">occurring they&amp;#39;re trying to push him</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="6.12">into basically buying more military</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="4.53">equipment they want him to join in with</text>
  <text start="389.39" dur="4.35">what all the other South Korean</text>
  <text start="390.98" dur="4.68">presidents did they want more of the Fed</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="3.9">missile system in South Korea and</text>
  <text start="395.66" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this he is</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="5.31">fighting back but it looks like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="5.73">a lot of pressure on him and we need to</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="4.92">put all of this in context we know that</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="4.26">the corporate media is reporting this</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="3.75">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that North Korea</text>
  <text start="409.79" dur="4.86">yes they have this h-bomb it caused a</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="5.1">6.3 magnitude tremor in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.5">when you really look at it and you look</text>
  <text start="416.72" dur="4.11">at their testing they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="2.73">that North Korea has been testing</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="4.49">nuclear weapons and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="6.57">exploding them and if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="9.13">all the way back to October 9th of 2006</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="9.45">they tested a 0.5 to 1 kiloton type of</text>
  <text start="434.45" dur="7.11">nuclear weapon and if you fast-forward</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="6.39">to February 12th of 2013 it was a six to</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="6.57">nine kiloton nuclear weapon if you fast</text>
  <text start="444.29" dur="8.28">forward to September 9th of 2016 it was</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="5.49">a ten kiloton type of weapon now a year</text>
  <text start="452.57" dur="2.82">later</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="4.41">now think about it from October 6</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="5.79">October 9 2006 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="5.85">September 9th 2016 they went from a say</text>
  <text start="461.18" dur="6.39">1 kiloton nuclear weapon all the way up</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="7.61">to a ten kiloton nuclear weapon now one</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="9.62">year later they detonated a hundred-plus</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="10.24">kiloton nuclear weapon which caused a</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="7.75">6.3 magnitude tremor something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="481.73" dur="6.9">fit here something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="5.82">now to put this into perspective if we</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="4.62">look at the US treinen and the Russian</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="5.88">SS ballistic missiles they have a yield</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="6.42">of 455 to 800 kilotons and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="6.84">trying to tell us that North Korea just</text>
  <text start="499.67" dur="7.8">tested a hundred kiloton weapon where a</text>
  <text start="503.48" dur="6.9">year later they tested a ten kiloton and</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="5.52">all the years previous going back</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="4.68">something like eight years or so they</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="3.9">went from a 1 to a 10 and it took them a</text>
  <text start="515.06" dur="4.23">very long time but in 1 year they went</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="5.16">from ten to a hundred something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.29" dur="4.83">seem right here now I know Trump is out</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="4.32">there and he is saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="4.47">gonna stop trade with all countries that</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="4.89">do business with North Korea China and</text>
  <text start="528.59" dur="4.35">the rest now once again we need to</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="5.1">understand that the United States is</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="6.6">very dependent on China because if he</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="6.18">goes forward with this guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="4.35">going to hurt the United States because</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="3.72">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="4.95">China is North Korea&amp;#39;s largest trading</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="4.32">partner and Trump&amp;#39;s talk of cutting off</text>
  <text start="548.84" dur="3.93">trade was clearly aimed at China but</text>
  <text start="550.58" dur="5.46">China is also the largest trading</text>
  <text start="552.77" dur="5.25">partner with the US and nearly 650</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="5.1">billion in goods and services are traded</text>
  <text start="558.02" dur="7.56">between the two nations and we can see</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="6.96">if trading stops remember China is the</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="3.93">manufacturing company guess what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="3.15">to happen here to the United States</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="4.34">we&amp;#39;re not going to be able to get parts</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="5.45">the store shelves are gonna go empty and</text>
  <text start="573.85" dur="6.34">the United States is going to get hit</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="7.11">because the United States is dependent</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="4.91">on China it&amp;#39;s not the other way around</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="5.07">their goods because if we don&amp;#39;t receive</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="6.42">their goods the shelves are empty the</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="6.3">service economy well it breaks down yes</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="4.14">it will affect China because they will</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="2.88">have nowhere to place these goods and</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="3.3">maybe they&amp;#39;ll start shipping them off to</text>
  <text start="599.35" dur="4.77">other countries but it&amp;#39;s going to really</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="4.23">hit the United States because if the</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="3.78">service industry where people are</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="3.87">purchasing things goes down the tubes</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="5.04">guess what there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="609.76" dur="6.6">problem here we see that the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="6.63">they have broken the Isis siege in Deir</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="6.9">Azur and they are making huge gains in</text>
  <text start="619.57" dur="6.48">this area and it looks like the al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="6.06">faction in the Islamic state faction the</text>
  <text start="626.05" dur="5.01">rest of the moderate rebels they are in</text>
  <text start="629.32" dur="4.56">big trouble now</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="5.07">and it looks like it&amp;#39;s only a matter of</text>
  <text start="633.88" dur="4.77">time before Russia and Syria completely</text>
  <text start="636.13" dur="4.11">take over the country and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="2.88">reason for the United States to be in</text>
  <text start="640.24" dur="3.9">there and I think this is why the Cabal</text>
  <text start="641.53" dur="4.86">is working so hard to create some type</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="4.29">of an event or war now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="646.39" dur="3.68">interesting about all of this and we</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="7.11">discussed this many many times before</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="8.2">where we had this grid x4 cyber war</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="4.5">exercise where they were testing the</text>
  <text start="658.27" dur="6.06">power grid they were testing everything</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="9.24">but the White House expanded the power</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="8.3">grid war and they are including the big</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="6.99">banks Wall Street and the</text>
  <text start="672.63" dur="6.31">telecommunications industry now and what</text>
  <text start="676.27" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying is that and this is</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="5.25">coming from the cybersecurity</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="7.5">coordinator Rob Joyce saying that they</text>
  <text start="684.19" dur="6.39">need to include all of this because the</text>
  <text start="687.85" dur="6.38">electricity sector goes far beyond the</text>
  <text start="690.58" dur="6.09">power grid they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="5.94">financial sector the communication</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="6.81">sector well this needs to be included in</text>
  <text start="700.17" dur="5.47">these tests now we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="703.48" dur="5.46">before we know there&amp;#39;s a kill switch on</text>
  <text start="705.64" dur="6.06">the bat system on the Nasdaq and on the</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="4.8">stock exchange so if something starts to</text>
  <text start="711.7" dur="5.43">happen where the market comes down they</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="5.1">can kill basically all trading with a</text>
  <text start="717.13" dur="4.38">flip of the switch</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="5.19">if the banks are hit basically they can</text>
  <text start="721.51" dur="6.11">go on bank holiday now there including</text>
  <text start="724.03" dur="7.53">all this in their testing and we know</text>
  <text start="727.62" dur="4.9">eventually there&amp;#39;s going to be some type</text>
  <text start="731.56" dur="3.99">of an event because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="5.31">need to explain why the economy is not</text>
  <text start="735.55" dur="3.72">doing well and they mean they need to</text>
  <text start="737.83" dur="2.85">make it look really really good and</text>
  <text start="739.27" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve been testing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="740.68" dur="4.71">while and I do believe back in 2003 when</text>
  <text start="743.41" dur="4.32">the eastern seaboard when they lost</text>
  <text start="745.39" dur="4.5">power I believe this was a test to see</text>
  <text start="747.73" dur="5.57">if they can bring down the power grid</text>
  <text start="749.89" dur="5.55">just like years before they tested</text>
  <text start="753.3" dur="3.91">bringing down the towers where they</text>
  <text start="755.44" dur="3.6">exploded something in the basement then</text>
  <text start="757.21" dur="3.72">they had to change their tactics and put</text>
  <text start="759.04" dur="4.62">explosives on each floor and bring the</text>
  <text start="760.93" dur="6.05">building down and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="763.66" dur="7.32">that they are making preparations for</text>
  <text start="766.98" dur="6.94">some type of cyber scenario where they</text>
  <text start="770.98" dur="4.95">can say North Korea or it&amp;#39;s publicly</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="3.48">North Korea or China or maybe even</text>
  <text start="775.93" dur="3.87">Russia and they might even go that far</text>
  <text start="777.4" dur="4.77">where they actually hit the financial</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="3.87">institutions because it&amp;#39;s very easy for</text>
  <text start="782.17" dur="4.2">them to report this on the corporate</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="5.28">media because they really don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="4.5">show proof and they really like doing</text>
  <text start="788.95" dur="3.12">things where they can use propaganda and</text>
  <text start="790.87" dur="5.04">they don&amp;#39;t have to show that much proof</text>
  <text start="792.07" dur="5.88">and if we go back to Sony Pictures</text>
  <text start="795.91" dur="3.69">they just blamed it right on North Korea</text>
  <text start="797.95" dur="3.69">did they show any proof no they just</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="3.53">told you that yes it was North Korea</text>
  <text start="801.64" dur="4.35">they didn&amp;#39;t have to show anything and</text>
  <text start="803.13" dur="4.54">once again they&amp;#39;re including Wall Street</text>
  <text start="805.99" dur="3.93">there including the telecommunications</text>
  <text start="807.67" dur="3.6">as handles all the communications and</text>
  <text start="809.92" dur="3.12">transactions that go back and forth</text>
  <text start="811.27" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re talking about the banks because</text>
  <text start="813.04" dur="3.62">they know eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="814.54" dur="4.98">happen and we know from Janet Napolitano</text>
  <text start="816.66" dur="5.71">when she was head of DHS she said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="4.98">not if but when there is a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="822.37" dur="3.84">and we can see that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="824.5" dur="4.77">prepping for this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="826.21" dur="5.22">and we know within the systems there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="829.27" dur="4.53">already software because we know the CIA</text>
  <text start="831.43" dur="4.95">has the ability to do this now from grid</text>
  <text start="833.8" dur="5.01">7 and all of this they have the software</text>
  <text start="836.38" dur="6.6">the malware just sitting there waiting</text>
  <text start="838.81" dur="6.99">and ready and we can see that once this</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="5.07">agenda this event moves forward and</text>
  <text start="845.8" dur="5.04">guess what they&amp;#39;ll be able to explain</text>
  <text start="848.05" dur="4.47">why this is happening and they can</text>
  <text start="850.84" dur="3.66">explain away why the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.52" dur="5.09">doing well it&amp;#39;s because of this country</text>
  <text start="854.5" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;ll have their entire excuse and</text>
  <text start="857.61" dur="4.72">basically this is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="859.96" dur="6.36">because you can see right now they have</text>
  <text start="862.33" dur="7.34">expanded their cyber test they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.32" dur="6.33">telling you that now the bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="869.67" dur="5.73">entire Wall Street operation the</text>
  <text start="872.65" dur="6.42">communications it&amp;#39;s all part of it and</text>
  <text start="875.4" dur="5.2">this basically is telling us that they</text>
  <text start="879.07" dur="4.08">are getting prepared and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="880.6" dur="4.68">maybe one step away from having this</text>
  <text start="883.15" dur="4.68">event you can see how they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="885.28" dur="4.38">their agenda in North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.83" dur="3.48">pushing it very hard they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="889.66" dur="4.92">convince the world that we need to go in</text>
  <text start="891.31" dur="5.48">there we need to stop them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="894.58" dur="5.19">talking about war they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="896.79" dur="5.32">kim jeong-hoon doing something they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="899.77" dur="5.19">saying he&amp;#39;s getting ready to maybe hit</text>
  <text start="902.11" dur="6.45">the united states maybe use an EMP maybe</text>
  <text start="904.96" dur="5.64">do something and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="3.96">are really pushing their agenda very</text>
  <text start="910.6" dur="5.04">very hard right now because they have</text>
  <text start="912.52" dur="5.07">nothing left and they know the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.64" dur="3.84">falling apart and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="917.59" dur="3.09">been pushing so hard this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="919.48" dur="2.91">been telling everyone to get ready and</text>
  <text start="920.68" dur="3.42">prepared and we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="922.39" dur="3.6">is becoming this everything is coming</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="3.03">full circle right now everything that we</text>
  <text start="925.99" dur="3.39">talked about everything that we</text>
  <text start="927.13" dur="4.56">discussed we could see that we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="929.38" dur="6.21">to this point where it&amp;#39;s either nothing</text>
