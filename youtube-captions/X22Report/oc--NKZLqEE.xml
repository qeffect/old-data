  <text start="279.51" dur="6.06">their stimulus policies and we can see</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.28">where all of this wealth flowed into it</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="3.18">didn&amp;#39;t hit the everyday person it didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="295.169" dur="3.18">along where the wealthier were getting</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="4.71">wealthier and there&amp;#39;s a disconnect</text>

  <text start="301.32" dur="3.569">the middle class and the poor and you</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="3.9">can see why the middle class and the</text>
  <text start="304.889" dur="5.25">poor are sitting here going hey what</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="5.85">about us and these are the people that</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="4.71">are getting hit the hardest but those</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.28">individuals on top and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="314.849" dur="5.491">time we can see all those countries that</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="4.709">had revolutions all those countries</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="5.22">that went after royalty well this is</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="6.271">what happened the class is separated and</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="5.43">the top tier they didn&amp;#39;t care what was</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="5.55">going on with the middle or the bottom</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="7.5">tier they were out of touch that is what</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="6.81">is happening right now now the Fed has</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="6.03">issued a subprime warning because</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re realizing there&amp;#39;s major problems</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="6.42">in the debt area and this is the</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="6.39">household debt area now remember debt is</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="5.27">their product but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="5.61">everyone to declare bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="5.47">they don&amp;#39;t want countries to declare</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="5.58">bankruptcy they want that middle ground</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="6.12">where you&amp;#39;re stuck in this debt hole you</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="5.58">just have enough to pay it but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="5.79">really get anywhere unless you take on</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="5.07">some more debt and you have enough just</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="4.62">to pay that off they never want people</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="4.86">to go bankrupt because they lose out</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t want countries to default</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="4.32">they lose out they like that middle</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="4.86">ground where they have total control and</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="5.37">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that US</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="6.06">credit card debt once again rose above 1</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="5.28">trillion and it was dropping for a while</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="4.5">but we can see that people have been</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="4.74">using their credit cards once again why</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="4.2">because people have been losing their</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="5.909">jobs people have gotten part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="5.43">and when we look at the latest quarterly</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="5.131">household debt and credit report by the</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="5.54">New York Fed the debt rose to a no</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="7.26">record high in the second quarter and</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="8.74">this is on the back of mortgages auto</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="6.18">student and credit card debt now the</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="4.32">mortgages were not adding on that many</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="6.29">new mortgages but what we are adding on</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="6.599">our auto student and credit card debt</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="5.17">aggregate household debt increase for</text>
  <text start="433.349" dur="6">the 13th consecutive quarter rising by</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="6.6">one hundred and sixteen billion to an</text>
  <text start="439.349" dur="6.961">all-time high as of September 30th 2017</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="6.799">total household indebtedness was twelve</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="6.65">point nine six trillion an increase of</text>
  <text start="449.599" dur="4.81">605 billion from a year ago and</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="4.359">equivalent to six</text>
  <text start="454.409" dur="5.94">six percent of u.s. GDP versus a high</text>
  <text start="457.319" dur="5.011">around 87 percent in early 2009 after</text>
  <text start="460.349" dur="5.55">years of deleveraging in the wake of the</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="5.549">2007 2009 recession household debt has</text>
  <text start="465.899" dur="6.181">risen more than sixteen point two</text>
  <text start="467.879" dur="6.81">percent since 2013 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="4.739">here is that auto loans they grew by 23</text>
  <text start="474.689" dur="5.13">billion credit card balances increased</text>
  <text start="476.819" dur="6.72">by 24 billion student loans so an</text>
  <text start="479.819" dur="7.791">increase of 13 billion and today people</text>
  <text start="483.539" dur="7.83">are in so much debt it is absolutely</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="7.929">ridiculous and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="491.369" dur="5.94">because people are using debt to get by</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="3.48">because people aren&amp;#39;t making enough</text>
  <text start="497.309" dur="3.54">people have part-time jobs people lost</text>
  <text start="499.019" dur="4.83">their jobs is a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="500.849" dur="4.5">not in the labor force anymore they want</text>
  <text start="503.849" dur="4.201">a job but they just can&amp;#39;t find it and</text>
  <text start="505.349" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s a lot of poor individuals that</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="4.709">are living off the government and using</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="7.65">debt to survive and we see right now</text>
  <text start="512.759" dur="7.02">that the central bank&amp;#39;s the government</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing this policy for a</text>
  <text start="519.779" dur="5.04">very long time and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="6">running into trouble the Fed has caution</text>
  <text start="524.819" dur="7.2">that there are over 23 million consumers</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="6.569">who hold subprime auto loans and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.019" dur="5.731">seeing the delinquency rates start to</text>
  <text start="534.689" dur="6.241">move up outstanding student loan debt</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="4.649">grew by 13 billion and stood at one</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="4.11">point three five seven trillion as of</text>
  <text start="542.399" dur="4.711">September 30th 2017 up from one point</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="4.109">three four four trillion in the second</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="5.07">quarter and eleven point two percent of</text>
  <text start="549.149" dur="5.79">aggregate student loan debt was 90 plus</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.009">days delinquent or in default in the</text>
  <text start="554.939" dur="4.411">third quarter of 2017 now if we look at</text>
  <text start="557.189" dur="4.38">the automobile industry we see</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.289">delinquency rates among auto finance</text>
  <text start="561.569" dur="4.471">lenders are considerably higher and</text>
  <text start="563.639" dur="4.291">rising especially for these subprime</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="4.739">borrowers this is why the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="6.36">there giving us this warning that there</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="4.951">might be problems ahead now we can see</text>
  <text start="574.29" dur="3.57">that the economy and we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="5.909">at many different economic sectors and</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="6.419">each one is starting to fail and when</text>
  <text start="581.639" dur="4.38">they all start to fail they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="584.279" dur="3.511">affect other sectors and when those</text>
  <text start="586.019" dur="3.571">sectors start to fail we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="4.65">to have a huge problem with the entire</text>
  <text start="589.59" dur="5.31">system comes down now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="4.65">about the Treasury yields and the yield</text>
  <text start="594.9" dur="5.31">curve and the flattening yield curve and</text>
  <text start="597.09" dur="6.72">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="600.21" dur="7.02">yield curve well it hit new cycle flats</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="7.5">the flattest since 2007 and the last two</text>
  <text start="607.23" dur="7.38">times the yield curve was this flat the</text>
  <text start="611.31" dur="7.77">US economy was in a recession and if we</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="6.54">go back to 2007 this is when it began</text>
  <text start="619.08" dur="4.56">this is when everything started to go</text>
  <text start="621.15" dur="7.65">south the feds started to raise the</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="8.01">rates back in 2004 through 2005 to 2006</text>
  <text start="628.8" dur="6.69">and the yield curve started to flatten</text>
  <text start="631.65" dur="5.91">so the Fed said oh we better reverse</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="5.34">this and they started to lower the rates</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="5.16">but it was too late the damage was</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="4.59">already done and the financial</text>
  <text start="642.72" dur="4.44">conditions fell apart we see the same</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="4.17">thing happening once again they were</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="5.58">raising rates and the yield curve was</text>
  <text start="649.59" dur="4.92">starting to flatten and they stopped it</text>
  <text start="652.74" dur="3.92">because they realized if they continued</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="4.77">with this they would crash the economy</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="4.66">so they held off even though</text>
  <text start="659.28" dur="3.9">unemployment is coming down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="4.68">telling us the economy&amp;#39;s doing great the</text>
  <text start="663.18" dur="5.16">stock market is that all time highs yes</text>
  <text start="666" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s up and down a little bit but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.34" dur="3.78">still at all-time highs the same thing</text>
  <text start="669.81" dur="6.21">that we saw back in 2008 when it was at</text>
  <text start="672.12" dur="5.49">14,000 points they realize if there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="676.02" dur="3.6">event or there&amp;#39;s no one else to blame</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="3.93">and they just raised the rates and the</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="5.34">system Falls they&amp;#39;re gonna be blamed</text>
  <text start="681.54" dur="5.67">this is why they stopped it and while</text>
  <text start="684.96" dur="3.87">this is all happening we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="687.21" dur="4.32">trying to figure out a way out of this</text>
  <text start="688.83" dur="4.53">but there is no way out of this the</text>
