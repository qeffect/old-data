  <text start="111.25" dur="6.39">pushing the cybersecurity information</text>
  <text start="113.62" dur="7.62">sharing act which is sissa kind of</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="5.28">stalled in Congress they try to push it</text>

  <text start="122.92" dur="6.839">blaming it on Russia North Korea China</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.5">but it didn&amp;#39;t work it didn&amp;#39;t really get</text>
  <text start="129.759" dur="5.191">any type of traction well lawmakers once</text>
  <text start="132.28" dur="5.849">again are going to push this bill</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="6.27">forward they&amp;#39;re going to masquerade this</text>
  <text start="138.129" dur="6.03">surveillance bill as cyber security we</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="6.329">know it&amp;#39;s not cybersecurity we know it</text>
  <text start="144.159" dur="4.561">allows corporations to hand over your</text>
  <text start="147.549" dur="4.261">personal information to the government</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="6.659">and it doesn&amp;#39;t hold the company&amp;#39;s liable</text>

  <text start="155.379" dur="8.881">bank account my balance in my banks</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="4.99">where I go on the internet</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="5.039">this is not going to help them stop</text>
  <text start="166.39" dur="8.64">attacks because if you understand the</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="8.64">mindset of a hacker or an attacker they</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="6">always mask what they&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="177.939" dur="5.371">bounce their tax of off of different</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="3.56">servers and having my personal</text>
  <text start="183.31" dur="4.89">information in your personal information</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="5.429">does not help the government at all on</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="5.159">plus the government&amp;#39;s going to have your</text>
  <text start="190.019" dur="5.47">information and if the government gets</text>
  <text start="193.359" dur="4.77">hacked oh wait they have been many many</text>
  <text start="195.489" dur="5.37">times they can&amp;#39;t even keep that safe but</text>
  <text start="198.129" dur="5.311">the corporations won&amp;#39;t be held liable so</text>
  <text start="200.859" dur="6.901">all this is that all this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="6.9">do with cyber attacks cybersecurity this</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="5.339">has to do with getting personal</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="4.47">information on each and every individual</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="3.78">because if we go back to the US Freedom</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="5.429">Act or actually further back to the</text>
  <text start="216.879" dur="6.36">Patriot Act which they used to spy on</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="5.071">the people that expired they had the USA</text>
  <text start="223.239" dur="3.75">Freedom Act which allowed companies to</text>
  <text start="225.31" dur="4.709">spy on the people because they had</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="5.97">everything in place the only thing</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="5.03">missing is to have all that information</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="5.521">given over to the government and the</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="5.08">company&amp;#39;s not to be held liable and this</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="3.539">is the other part that they need right</text>
  <text start="240.129" dur="4.771">now and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="5.22">push through and we shouldn&amp;#39;t be fooled</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="5.119">by it because we understand that this</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="5.18">has nothing to do with cybersecurity and</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="5.141">everyone should protect themselves</text>
  <text start="252.419" dur="4.481">everyone should use start page which</text>
  <text start="255.16" dur="4.41">will mask your searches I mean if you</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="4.679">find other search engines use those I</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="5.43">mean it plugs into Google but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="6.421">recognize who you are you can use</text>
  <text start="265" dur="5.57">encryption for your email you can use</text>
  <text start="268" dur="7.02">any of these things to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="7.27">now Obama wants to internationalize the</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="5.369">internet but Congress is saying this</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="3.87">might be unconstitutional a group of</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="2.761">lawmakers sent a letter to the</text>

  <text start="287.74" dur="6.03">functions to a global multi-stakeholder</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="4.599">raised concerns about the</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="3.449">administration&amp;#39;s authority to do this</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="2.43">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this is</text>
  <text start="297.219" dur="3.6">completely</text>
  <text start="297.849" dur="7.55">unconstitutional and there were certain</text>
  <text start="300.819" dur="11.88">senators chuck Grassley Rob Goodlatte</text>
  <text start="305.399" dur="10.6">Ted Cruz darrell Issa they put together</text>
  <text start="312.699" dur="6.661">a letter saying that you know Congress</text>
  <text start="315.999" dur="6.45">has the exclusive power to dispose and</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="5.579">make all needful rules and regulations</text>

  <text start="324.939" dur="4.35">property belong to the United States and</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="6.419">they&amp;#39;re challenging Obama you have to</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="7.291">remember they want the UN basically to</text>
  <text start="333.159" dur="6.78">control the internet to set the</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="6.329">standards to basically control who can</text>
  <text start="339.939" dur="7.26">speak who can&amp;#39;t speak they want to issue</text>
  <text start="342.909" dur="6.02">licenses to certain companies and</text>
  <text start="347.199" dur="3.93">individuals and if you don&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="348.929" dur="5.92">most likely you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="5.25">broadcast on the internet and just like</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="4.4">political correctness they&amp;#39;re caught</text>
  <text start="356.379" dur="5.69">trying to control everything which</text>
  <text start="359.249" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re going to have a tough time doing</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="4.18">now I know a lot of people think that</text>
  <text start="364.569" dur="5.64">mine our minority report which was a</text>
  <text start="366.249" dur="7.89">movie is complete science fiction but</text>
  <text start="370.209" dur="8.94">we&amp;#39;re starting to see what happened in</text>
  <text start="374.139" dur="7.8">Minority Report happened today I mean in</text>
  <text start="379.149" dur="4.98">Minority Report police use holographic</text>

  <text start="384.129" dur="4.02">cameras dimensional maps and database</text>
  <text start="385.809" dur="7.17">feeds to monitor the movements of its</text>
  <text start="388.149" dur="6.75">citizens well in reality Microsoft in</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="3.81">partnership in New York City has</text>
  <text start="394.899" dur="4.05">developed a crime-fighting system that</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="4.201">will allow police to quickly collate</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="5.161">visualize vast amounts of data from</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="6.089">cameras license plate readers 911 calls</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.309">police databases and other sources it</text>
  <text start="407.079" dur="6.77">will then display the information in</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="9.15">real-time both visually chronologically</text>
  <text start="413.849" dur="7.03">just like in Minority Report in minority</text>
  <text start="418.569" dur="6.2">report no matter where people go in the</text>
  <text start="420.879" dur="6.39">world one&amp;#39;s biometric data precedes them</text>
  <text start="424.769" dur="5.351">allowing corporations to tap into their</text>

  <text start="447.96" dur="6.27">hearing in the real world so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.1" dur="3.81">starting to see a lot of similarities</text>
  <text start="454.23" dur="4.08">actually police departments around the</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="5.46">country have begun using the mobile</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="7.23">offender recognition and information</text>

  <text start="471.96" dur="6.24">of suspected criminals and match them</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="7.02">against government databases I mean</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="7.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing this today a minority</text>

  <text start="519.6" dur="6.45">these people going forward so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.44" dur="6.39">starting to see the same things that</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="8.21">occurred in this movie and a lot of it</text>
  <text start="529.83" dur="7.86">is already reality now out in</text>
