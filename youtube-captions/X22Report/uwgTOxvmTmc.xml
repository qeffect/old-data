  <text start="180.38" dur="6.34">we know Prime Minister tsipras he was</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.979">elected in to office because he told the</text>

  <text start="216.18" dur="4.67">the constitution and the powers of the</text>
  <text start="219.48" dur="3.93">president now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="4.06">European nations doing this where</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re looking at their constitution</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="4.29">yes the US would like to change their</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="4.5">constitution too but we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="7.05">watch this very carefully to see where</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="10.669">this is actually going out in the UK we</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="11.299">see manufacturing well it is contracting</text>
  <text start="242.269" dur="7.78">now this is contracting at a fast pace</text>
  <text start="247.549" dur="4.151">haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this in the</text>
  <text start="250.049" dur="4.231">last three years of course everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="5.19">gonna be blaming this on the brexit but</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="6.57">all of this is happening around the</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="5.94">world at the same time and when we look</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="5.01">at this we see that because of this</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="6.27">contraction the Bank of England they</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="5.94">might cut interest rates in August now</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="5.189">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of central banks cut</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="5.48">interest rates we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="5.971">countries or European Union&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="5.8">negative interest rates in the United</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="4.8">States we might even be heading to</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="4.8">negative interest rates but out in the</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="6.21">UK the output index fell to forty seven</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="6.06">point eight in July in 53.6 in June this</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="3.86">is the lowest since October 2012 here in</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="3.5">the United States</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="5.25">Manufacturing weather</text>
  <text start="297.44" dur="5.07">got a little bump up it bounced up to</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="4.26">nine-month highs what does that really</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="2.82">mean everyone says oh not much it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="2.79">incredible</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="5.16">but really when you look at this and we</text>
  <text start="307.43" dur="7.65">look at manufacturing manufacturing at</text>
  <text start="310.49" dur="7.11">one point was much much higher than it</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="6.48">is today today we&amp;#39;re hovering around 52</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.46">53 or so back in the times when the</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="6.3">economy was doing very well</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="7.58">I mean we were approaching 65 around</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="5.88">that area and all we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="4.84">manufacturing is continually in its</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.71">downward trend yes we&amp;#39;re getting little</text>
  <text start="335.48" dur="7.02">dead-cat bounces here and there but the</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="5.55">trend continues downward and I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="2.76">really surprised that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="344" dur="2.58">picked up a little bit because we saw</text>
  <text start="345.26" dur="3.18">that little pick up and bolt of dry</text>
  <text start="346.58" dur="5.64">index where that is a shipment of raw</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="7.62">material into factories but this is not</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="5.55">going to repair the entire economy like</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="3.54">the corporate media likes to make you</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="3.899">believe is happening where they say oh</text>
  <text start="359.6" dur="4.31">look there&amp;#39;s a bounce in housing oh</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="4.411">there&amp;#39;s a bounce in manufacturing</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="4.33">everything must be improving now these</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.14">are dead cat bounces and as soon as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="4.56">over what happens is everything starts</text>
  <text start="370.22" dur="4.61">to decline once again it does not</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="5.25">improve it doesn&amp;#39;t get any better and</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.51">what we&amp;#39;re looking at in manufacturing</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s two different things happening</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="5.85">here we have the PMI US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="5.58">which had this bump up we have the is M</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="5.46">in manufacturing that started to decline</text>
  <text start="387.89" dur="5.7">but when we truly step back and we look</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="6.39">at the overall picture it is in a</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="7.35">downward trend and every time we have</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="8.45">these little bounces it ends up even</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="7.979">worse later on I mean if we go back to</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="7">June of 2015 when we had this bounce up</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="6.301">in is M manufacturing it declined</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="5.1">rapidly from June to December when we</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="6.87">had a bump up and PMI in September of</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="6.96">2015 it declined rapidly to this point</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="4.8">today and we&amp;#39;re going to see the same</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.95">thing happen once again we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="4.3">construction spending for the third</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="4.57">month in a row us constructions</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="7.17">dropped month-on-month tumble point six</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="7.65">percent in June missing in a point five</text>
  <text start="438.36" dur="5.4">percent bounce now this is the weakest</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="4.34">annual growth since July of 2011 and</text>
  <text start="443.76" dur="6.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that the</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="8.05">housing market is doing awesomely well</text>
  <text start="450.02" dur="8.23">with construction spending continually</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="9.99">declining for the third month in a row</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="8.25">now we saw this prior to 2008 where</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="5.01">everything started to decline and when</text>
  <text start="466.5" dur="4.11">we were in 2007 it declined we had a</text>
  <text start="469.11" dur="3.75">little bounce up and then things really</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.83">started to fall apart and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="7.35">looking at right now looks very similar</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="6.75">to that right before 2008 so when we</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="4.92">look at this we see us June private</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="4.2">construction spending Falls by 0.6% u.s.</text>
  <text start="485.13" dur="3.29">private non-residential construction</text>
  <text start="486.39" dur="5.34">Falls most since December</text>
  <text start="488.42" dur="6.04">April construction outlays fell 2.9</text>
  <text start="491.73" dur="4.8">percent us state local government</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="5.01">construction outlays lowest since</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="6.36">November but again everything is awesome</text>
  <text start="499.47" dur="7.58">right no it isn&amp;#39;t things are getting</text>
  <text start="502.89" dur="7.92">worse as we move forward into this year</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="8.169">now something very interesting the sixth</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="7.109">biggest economy on earth is right here</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="7.621">in the United States it it is US</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="9.961">government entitlements now the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="8.22">entitlements they have exploded we have</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="7.35">about 110 million citizens now receiving</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="6.39">some form of means of benefits when you</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="3.81">add social security into this it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="6.3">hundred and sixty million citizens</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="7.95">getting checks from Washington the total</text>
  <text start="543.75" dur="8.49">cost now is three trillion per year and</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s continually rising and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="4.56">interesting about this it is the sixth</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="4.56">biggest economy in the world so we have</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="4.41">a society that is rapidly agents the</text>
  <text start="558.72" dur="5.61">tune of 10,000 baby boomer tires per day</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="3.75">this 50% dependency ratio is not even</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="4.35">remotely</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="5.85">sustainable there are currently 126</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="5.91">million prime working age persons in the</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="5.91">United States between 25 and 54 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="5.82">up from 121 million at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="7.08">2000 yet even as the current business</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="6.33">cycle is rolling over the 77 million</text>
  <text start="583.8" dur="5.67">persons employed full-time from the pool</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="6.78">is still 1.2 million below its</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="7.41">turn-of-the-century level yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="593.52" dur="6.36">right only 61 percent of the prime</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="7.91">working age population has full-time</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="10.23">jobs that compares to 65 percent as</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="9.58">recently as the year 2000 so you might</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="6.78">want to wonder how is it possible that a</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="4.32">real consumption expenditure rose by a</text>
  <text start="616.89" dur="3.27">whopping three point trillion or</text>
  <text start="618.69" dur="3.96">thirty-eight percent during the year</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="5.07">during the same 16 year period that the</text>
  <text start="622.65" dur="7.62">number of full-time age workers were</text>
  <text start="625.23" dur="6.63">actually dropping the Fed has never once</text>
  <text start="630.27" dur="3.6">mentioned the rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="5.28">quality of household income and spending</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="6">during the last 15 years wages are</text>
  <text start="637.14" dur="5.67">continually dropping people are losing</text>
  <text start="639.87" dur="8.55">those high-paying jobs getting part-time</text>
  <text start="642.81" dur="8.28">jobs or no job at all so this scenario</text>
  <text start="648.42" dur="8.16">that we are in is a disaster but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.09" dur="8.27">worse really back in 2010 the Social</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="6.69">Security they unofficially went bankrupt</text>
  <text start="659.36" dur="6.3">for the first time since the enactment</text>
  <text start="663.27" dur="5.73">of Social Security amendments of 1983</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="6.58">annual outlays for the program exceeded</text>
  <text start="669" dur="6.45">receipts the deficit has grown every</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="6.45">year since 2010 and is now up 8%</text>
  <text start="675.45" dur="10.05">annually and is projected to be 31% in</text>
  <text start="678.69" dur="10.2">2026 and 44% by 2046 so let&amp;#39;s put this</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="5.9">into perspective here the program pays</text>
  <text start="688.89" dur="8.249">more than 60 million beneficiaries</text>
  <text start="691.4" dur="8.919">almost one in five Americans now</text>
  <text start="697.139" dur="6.36">the OASDI the old age survivors</text>
  <text start="700.319" dur="7.2">disability insurance represents 25% of</text>
  <text start="703.499" dur="6.36">all annual federal spending and for more</text>
  <text start="707.519" dur="4.771">than half of these beneficiaries these</text>
  <text start="709.859" dur="6.861">benefits represent their sole or primary</text>
  <text start="712.29" dur="7.409">source of income now the good news is</text>
  <text start="716.72" dur="6.159">since Social Security came into</text>
  <text start="719.699" dur="5.13">existence in 1935 the program collected</text>
  <text start="722.879" dur="5.43">two point nine trillion more than it</text>
  <text start="724.829" dur="5.43">paid out the bad news is that the two</text>
  <text start="728.309" dur="8.34">point nine trillion has already been</text>
  <text start="730.259" dur="10.92">spent so right now Social Security is</text>
  <text start="736.649" dur="7.23">completely broke there&amp;#39;s nothing in</text>
  <text start="741.179" dur="5.01">there I remember this is not the</text>
  <text start="743.879" dur="4.02">government&amp;#39;s money this is the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.189" dur="3.601">money this is the money they take from</text>

  <text start="815.069" dur="8.94">eventually it all comes to an end the</text>
  <text start="818.97" dur="8.219">European banking system it is a complete</text>
  <text start="824.009" dur="6.42">disaster right now they&amp;#39;ve just done a</text>
  <text start="827.189" dur="6.81">stress test and out of the 51 lenders</text>

  <text start="833.999" dur="6.27">look good the banks are not properly</text>
  <text start="837.569" dur="5.31">situated to withstand a major market</text>
  <text start="840.269" dur="5.581">event and we know these stress tests</text>
  <text start="842.879" dur="5.01">these this is an illusion this is what</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="4.859">they use to convince you that everything</text>
  <text start="847.889" dur="6.57">is fine they don&amp;#39;t want you worried</text>
  <text start="850.709" dur="5.91">about what happened in 2008 and we know</text>
  <text start="854.459" dur="5.58">right now that these banks like Deutsche</text>
  <text start="856.619" dur="7.56">Bank like the Italian banks to</text>
  <text start="860.039" dur="5.15">Portuguese banks they&amp;#39;re a complete</text>
  <text start="864.179" dur="6.53">disaster</text>
  <text start="865.189" dur="9.34">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to implode and</text>
  <text start="870.709" dur="7.87">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right here is the</text>
  <text start="874.529" dur="7.11">system is breaking down so what does</text>
  <text start="878.579" dur="5.01">that mean that means the United States</text>
  <text start="881.639" dur="6.9">government central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="883.589" dur="7.62">need to do something to cover up this</text>
  <text start="888.539" dur="5.01">entire collapse and in the process while</text>
  <text start="891.209" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re covering it up they need to do</text>
  <text start="893.549" dur="6.63">something with the current currency now</text>
  <text start="898.499" dur="3.93">we know they&amp;#39;re pushing for war this is</text>
  <text start="900.179" dur="4.59">not gonna stop the collapses we&amp;#39;ll cover</text>
  <text start="902.429" dur="5.19">it up we know they want to reset the</text>
  <text start="904.769" dur="4.711">system and something very interesting</text>
  <text start="907.619" dur="5.52">this came out of the State of the Nation</text>
  <text start="909.48" dur="7.709">2012 where they looked at the new $100</text>
  <text start="913.139" dur="7.591">bill and when you look at the old $100</text>
  <text start="917.189" dur="8.46">bill there&amp;#39;s something on the $100 bill</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="10.429">which says the following this note is</text>
  <text start="925.649" dur="10.92">legal tender for all debts public and</text>
  <text start="931.159" dur="7.26">private and since the creation of the</text>
  <text start="936.569" dur="5.27">private western central bank back in</text>
  <text start="938.419" dur="5.89">1913 moving forward it took some time</text>
  <text start="941.839" dur="4.8">but eventually what happened especially</text>
  <text start="944.309" dur="5.94">in 1971</text>
  <text start="946.639" dur="6.52">that little statement was under the</text>
  <text start="950.249" dur="5.82">Federal Reserve logo on the bill and</text>
  <text start="953.159" dur="3.93">when you look on the $100 bill or any of</text>
  <text start="956.069" dur="4.921">the other bills you</text>
  <text start="957.089" dur="7.711">can see this statement but the new $100</text>
  <text start="960.99" dur="5.339">bill this is very interesting and many</text>
  <text start="964.8" dur="4.649">people talk about a gold standard memory</text>
  <text start="966.329" dur="7.141">many people talk about why is this all</text>
  <text start="969.449" dur="10.86">painted in gold the 100 is gold the ink</text>
  <text start="973.47" dur="9.659">well is in gold the quill is in gold but</text>
  <text start="980.309" dur="5.851">if you look at the bill straight on you</text>
  <text start="983.129" dur="5.9">see the security around at the blue</text>
  <text start="986.16" dur="5.299">ribbon in the middle the left hand side</text>
  <text start="989.029" dur="5.62">has to do with the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="991.459" dur="5.8">the right hand side has to do with the</text>
  <text start="994.649" dur="4.951">United States of America and they took</text>
  <text start="997.259" dur="5.041">that statement and they took it away</text>
  <text start="999.6" dur="4.83">from the Federal Reserve Note section</text>
  <text start="1002.3" dur="7.259">and they moved it under the United</text>
  <text start="1004.43" dur="8.31">States of America so this bill that they</text>
  <text start="1009.559" dur="10.231">created back in 2008 but it was released</text>
  <text start="1012.74" dur="11.61">in 2013 this might be the certificate</text>
  <text start="1019.79" dur="7.56">that you might have to use during the</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="5.309">crisis maybe you&amp;#39;ll just rip a portion</text>
  <text start="1027.35" dur="5.579">of it off and give them the right hand</text>
  <text start="1029.659" dur="6.18">side then the question is what happens</text>
  <text start="1032.929" dur="6.87">to all the older bills all the Federal</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="6.06">Reserve notes across the world maybe at</text>
  <text start="1039.799" dur="4.65">that point in time you will not be able</text>
  <text start="1041.899" dur="6.691">to redeem them they&amp;#39;ll say hey we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1044.449" dur="9.98">accept those anymore so when we look at</text>
  <text start="1048.59" dur="9.839">this we might want to exchange our old</text>
  <text start="1054.429" dur="8.86">currency for this new currency just hold</text>
  <text start="1058.429" dur="7.38">some of these just in case and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1063.289" dur="6.541">interesting when you look at this that</text>
  <text start="1065.809" dur="6.36">this is how they created it now is this</text>
  <text start="1069.83" dur="4.62">going to be the currency going forward</text>
  <text start="1072.169" dur="4.321">no I think this is an intermediate when</text>
  <text start="1074.45" dur="6.18">things are falling apart when you go</text>
  <text start="1076.49" dur="6.78">into a bank where you go anywhere you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1080.63" dur="4.769">need to show this to say huh this is the</text>
  <text start="1083.27" dur="5.039">new one you have the old one we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1085.399" dur="5.461">accept the old one and this is going to</text>
  <text start="1088.309" dur="5.161">make it very difficult for many many</text>
  <text start="1090.86" dur="5.28">people listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="6.05">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="1096.14" dur="3.38">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
