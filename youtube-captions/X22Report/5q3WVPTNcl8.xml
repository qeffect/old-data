  <text start="65.8" dur="6.78">when the system comes down it will not</text>
  <text start="68.53" dur="6.75">be a smooth landing let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.58" dur="4.02">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="75.28" dur="4.23">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing out in the</text>
  <text start="76.6" dur="7.52">corporate media is complete chaos and</text>
  <text start="79.51" dur="8.52">this is exactly what Trump and his</text>
  <text start="84.12" dur="7.15">people that are working to basically</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="7.08">take back the United States this is</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="5.7">exactly what they want and they need to</text>
  <text start="95.11" dur="4.44">do this they need to create chaos</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="5.6">because remember the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="99.55" dur="5.67">the mouthpiece to the deep state and</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="5.23">while they&amp;#39;re worried about all these</text>
  <text start="105.22" dur="5.34">ridiculous things Trump right now is</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="5.91">working in the background and what I</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="4.71">noticed is that the central bank be fed</text>
  <text start="113.71" dur="4.26">where they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="5.01">raising rates well they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="117.97" dur="3.75">raising rates up into a certain point</text>
  <text start="120.28" dur="2.91">until they can trigger the economy</text>
  <text start="121.72" dur="2.79">coming down and then they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="123.19" dur="3">start saying that they have to lower the</text>
  <text start="124.51" dur="4.05">rates and they&amp;#39;ll make some type of an</text>
  <text start="126.19" dur="6">excuse why they need to do that but what</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="6.179">I noticed already is that things might</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="3.87">have been triggered already and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="3.511">been following the economy for a very</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="5.79">long time and we&amp;#39;ve been watching it</text>
  <text start="138.25" dur="6.39">deteriorate every single day</text>
  <text start="141.85" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ve been pointing things out and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="3.659">been looking at all these different</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="5.88">things and it has not gotten better is</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="7.231">actually gotten worse and especially</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="6.33">with retail now retail is the core one</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="4.739">of the quarters right now of the United</text>
  <text start="157.93" dur="5.97">States for this economy to work because</text>
  <text start="160.269" dur="4.651">70% is spending of the American people</text>

  <text start="164.92" dur="5.15">health care is included in this but</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="5.57">retail is a very big chunk of it and</text>
  <text start="170.07" dur="6.19">retail is dying right now</text>

  <text start="192.97" dur="2.94">be the only retailer that is having this</text>
  <text start="195.52" dur="3.799">problem</text>
  <text start="195.91" dur="6.23">according to facts set we&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="6.191">earnings to come out from many different</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="5.05">retailers and what they&amp;#39;re looking at it</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="6.15">doesn&amp;#39;t look good they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="6.74">drug retail it&amp;#39;s like negative 1.1</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="6.38">they&amp;#39;re looking at specialty stores</text>

  <text start="218.04" dur="7.72">apparel retail negative 6.1 percent and</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.22">it goes on and on and on and we can see</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="2.91">yes they&amp;#39;re going to come out the</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="3.18">corporate media I can tell you this</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="4.64">right now they&amp;#39;re going to come out and</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="6.33">tell you how great internet sales are</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="8.05">now internet sales as we know that makes</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="9.72">up 8.6 3 percent of total retail sales</text>
  <text start="241.36" dur="8.73">it is a growing industry it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="6.72">beginning and yes it&amp;#39;s going to increase</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="6.48">as it grows and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="6.089">internet direct marketing retail well</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s up 20 percent but it only makes</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="4.861">makes up 8 percent of total retail but</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re not going to tell you that part</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re going to play on the part where</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to say it&amp;#39;s up you know 15</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="3.9">percent whatever the actual numbers that</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="3.48">come out are that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.8">to tell you these are estimated numbers</text>
  <text start="273.04" dur="6.18">and we can see most of the retail</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="5.73">industry is in the negative territory</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="4.71">and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good at all now</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve talked about the auto loan</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="5.79">industry the car industry and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.069">talking about this subprime 2.0 bubble</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="3.93">and people say well the auto industry is</text>
  <text start="291.729" dur="4.5">nothing like the housing bubble and that</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="5.01">won&amp;#39;t affect the economy whatsoever well</text>
  <text start="296.229" dur="4.56">it doesn&amp;#39;t have to do that much to</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="5.28">affect the economy because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.789" dur="5.341">seeing right now is that the auto loan</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.83">industry is increasingly looking like</text>
  <text start="306.13" dur="6.06">the subprime 2.0 the needle that will</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="8.22">pop the credit bubble all it has to do</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="6.42">is pop it and the rest all the oil that</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="4.11">comes down now</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="5.52">since 2009 roughly</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="6.33">one third of all new auto loans had been</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="6.36">subprime that in of itself is pretty</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="5.06">darn bad but we are now discovering</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="5.01">something very very interesting</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="8.23">interesting in the industry the industry</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="8.73">in general has a problem with fraud just</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.01">like the housing bubble remember it was</text>
  <text start="344.23" dur="3.3">fraud when they put together these</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="4.68">subprime securities and said these are</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="5.13">triple-a rated well this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.41" dur="4.71">happening in the auto industry remember</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="4.38">the real housing crisis was when the</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="4.86">contagion spread from the subprime</text>
  <text start="357.04" dur="5.37">mortgages into the prime space and it</text>
  <text start="359.98" dur="4.44">looks like we&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="5.46">thing but this time with the auto</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="5.57">industry as many as 1% of US car loan</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="5.67">applications includes some type of</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="5.95">material misrepresentation executives</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="4.92">and data analyst firm Point predictive</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="4.94">estimated based on reports from banks</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="5.4">finance companies and others lenders</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="7.93">losses from deception may double this</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="8.01">year to 6 billion from 2015 so I am NOT</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="6.48">saying that the auto loan debacle will</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="5.88">be the main crisis what I am saying is</text>
  <text start="395.29" dur="6.93">that the auto loans will be the needle</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="7.65">that triggers the crisis that will get</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="4.71">things rolling and this will spread and</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="6.03">believe me this is not the only thing</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="7.08">because remember since 2009 the Fed has</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="5.22">created massive bubbles in debt</text>
  <text start="414.01" dur="5.4">securities municipal bond corporate</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="5.67">bonds mortgages consumer credit debt</text>
  <text start="419.41" dur="5.82">auto loans they&amp;#39;ve done it in all these</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="5.19">areas we have the housing bubble just</text>
  <text start="425.23" dur="5.28">like housing was a small percentage of</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="5.42">the debt build-up to 2008 crisis auto</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="6.09">loans are a small percentage of the</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="6.82">post-2008 that build up but both asset</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="7.05">classes had fraud and subprime lending</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="6.32">as in underpinning and this time all it</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="5.82">has to do is prick the bubble and boom</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="5.17">everything falls apart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.02">starting to see it in different states</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="3.68">Connecticut for example the state of</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="4.31">Connecticut has</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="5.76">been hit hard by the double whammy of</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="6.72">deteriorating local economy coupled with</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="6.78">a plunge in hedge fund profits and this</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="5.01">is leading to a collapse in tax revenue</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="5.25">which means that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="5.13">poorly and these companies are moving</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="3.96">out of the state because they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="474.66" dur="3.96">for better tax breaks and things like</text>
  <text start="476.67" dur="4.38">that so what&amp;#39;s happening right now in</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="3.84">Connecticut is that the latest figures</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="3.75">show that the tax revenue from the</text>
  <text start="482.46" dur="5.91">state&amp;#39;s top 100 highest paying tax</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="7.2">payers declined by 45 percent from 2015</text>
  <text start="488.37" dur="7.26">to 2016 the drop adds up to 200 million</text>
  <text start="492" dur="6.81">revenue loss for Connecticut right now</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="6.96">there&amp;#39;s a 2 billion budget gap estimated</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="6.51">for next year I mean and Connecticut is</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="4.92">not the only state this is going to be</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="4.77">in most of the states because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.51" dur="4.05">happening is the local economies the</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="3.69">economies are in each one of these</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.65">states they&amp;#39;re declining yes there are</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="5.04">certain areas where they&amp;#39;re still doing</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="6.81">well but when this comes down it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="7.44">to affect everyone go back to 2008 there</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="5.1">were areas like Miami for instance well</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="3.51">that was hit last in the real estate</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="3.72">market business was booming there</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="5.76">everyone was driving fancy cars cranes</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="6.39">everywhere at the same time up in New</text>
  <text start="535.53" dur="5.04">York New Jersey things were getting hit</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="5.13">pretty darn hard up there layoffs were</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="5.37">beginning and Miami didn&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="6.14">until months later this is going to</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="7.98">happen once again now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="6.73">Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs as we</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="4.95">know is part of the central banking</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="6.45">system the deep state but they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="6.36">sending out warnings about an imminent</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="4.92">market correction and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="4.76">putting this out almost daily right now</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="5.64">and this is coming from cross asset</text>
  <text start="569.99" dur="5.86">strategist Ian Wright warned that last</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="6">time correlations where this Loeb was</text>
  <text start="575.85" dur="5.49">just before the financial crisis and we</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="3.99">can see that individuals inside of</text>
  <text start="581.34" dur="3.69">Goldman are looking at this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="3.36">saying something is going on right now</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="2.66">and it looks like the clock is ticking</text>
  <text start="586.59" dur="4.22">right now</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.91">and ticking down because the tax reforms</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="6.48">which Wall Street is expecting well</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="4.88">there&amp;#39;s only 39 days before August and</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="4.95">guess what happens at that point</text>
  <text start="598.48" dur="5.89">Congress well they leave they go on</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.43">vacation they don&amp;#39;t come back until</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="6.9">after Labor Day and remember the budget</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="5.49">only goes up to the end of September we</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="4.05">have the debt ceiling crisis coming up</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="3.84">and we&amp;#39;re approaching that very very</text>
  <text start="615.32" dur="4.71">quickly so we&amp;#39;re going to have a lot of</text>
  <text start="617" dur="4.86">things happen as we move into the summer</text>
  <text start="620.03" dur="3.84">months and especially the fall months</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="6.57">where things start to really fall apart</text>
  <text start="623.87" dur="8.1">now bill Blaine from mint is looking at</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="6.75">the situation in Europe and he&amp;#39;s finding</text>
  <text start="631.97" dur="7.01">that there&amp;#39;s something wrong with what</text>

  <text start="716.96" dur="3.45">implement austerity on the people and</text>
  <text start="718.94" dur="2.64">they continually did this an</text>
  <text start="720.41" dur="3.39">unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="4.89">unemployment rates went up and people</text>
  <text start="723.8" dur="5.52">are now suffering and when we look at</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="5.64">the entire situation they all use the</text>
  <text start="729.32" dur="4.4">same type of calculations like the</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="4.14">United States does when it comes to</text>
  <text start="733.72" dur="6.04">unemployment when it comes to inflation</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="6.24">when it comes to handing out statistics</text>
  <text start="739.76" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="5.01">out in Greece they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="744.53" dur="5.28">everything is once again fine because</text>
  <text start="747.5" dur="4.83">the government is implementing austerity</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re taking on more debt and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="752.33" dur="3.48">just saying okay these people haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="754.28" dur="3.63">been on an interview or anything like</text>
  <text start="755.81" dur="4.11">that so the unemployment rate is going</text>
  <text start="757.91" dur="4.8">down even though there are more and more</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="5.46">people still looking for jobs remember</text>
  <text start="762.71" dur="6.06">the unemployment rate when it&amp;#39;s at 25%</text>
  <text start="765.38" dur="5.91">or 28% does it really make a difference</text>
  <text start="768.77" dur="4.98">at this point there are so many people</text>
  <text start="771.29" dur="4.26">out of work it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that things</text>
  <text start="773.75" dur="4.2">just got better it means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.55" dur="4.68">recalculating and trying to make it look</text>
  <text start="777.95" dur="4.23">better and as the country continually</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="3.57">takes on more debt it just gets worse</text>
  <text start="782.18" dur="5.79">and worse and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="783.8" dur="7.71">now the Fed they are looking to raise</text>
  <text start="787.97" dur="4.86">rates in June and we can hear lot of the</text>
  <text start="791.51" dur="3.06">Fed officials are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="792.83" dur="3.27">yes we&amp;#39;re going to be raising the rates</text>
  <text start="794.57" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re going to be bringing them up and</text>
  <text start="796.1" dur="4.14">it looks like they just got another</text>
  <text start="798.53" dur="4.59">signal where they can raise the rates</text>
  <text start="800.24" dur="5.94">now remember the first quarter that was</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="4.65">just a fluke really doesn&amp;#39;t matter let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="4.44">look to the future because things are</text>
  <text start="807.77" dur="4.89">just going to get a lot better and the</text>
  <text start="810.62" dur="3.84">producer price index which measures</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="4.83">inflation at the wholesale level for</text>
  <text start="814.46" dur="5.25">goods and services well that has moved</text>
  <text start="817.49" dur="5.16">up and it&amp;#39;s jumped to 2.5 percent in</text>
  <text start="819.71" dur="5.15">April from a year ago now this is the</text>
  <text start="822.65" dur="5.07">steepest increase since February 2012</text>
  <text start="824.86" dur="6.67">blowing past the concessive consensus</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="6.35">expectations of 2.2 percent which the</text>
  <text start="831.53" dur="6.33">Fed looks at and says okay we&amp;#39;ve reached</text>
  <text start="834.07" dur="6.4">the inflation rate we wanted so now they</text>
  <text start="837.86" dur="4.56">can raise interest rates and it looks</text>
  <text start="840.47" dur="4.41">like they are preparing to do this now</text>
  <text start="842.42" dur="4.89">will they do this in June we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="844.88" dur="6.15">wait and save but we know one thing for</text>
  <text start="847.31" dur="6.99">sure is they are preparing and they are</text>
  <text start="851.03" dur="4.41">ready to bring the system down and all</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="2.88">they need to do is</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="4.86">bring the raids up to a certain point</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="5.61">until they trigger a collapsed scenario</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="5.16">then they&amp;#39;re going to back off they just</text>
  <text start="862.79" dur="6.24">want to trigger it because if they go</text>
  <text start="865.46" dur="6.51">too far they will be blamed for it just</text>
  <text start="869.03" dur="4.53">like if we go back to prior to 2008 they</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="3.72">raise the rates that raise the rates and</text>
  <text start="873.56" dur="3.81">as they were raising it out in</text>
  <text start="875.69" dur="3.21">California people were leaving their</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="3.36">homes they were leaving their stuff in</text>
  <text start="878.9" dur="4.74">their homes and they weren&amp;#39;t looking</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="5.04">back they triggered it at that point</text>
  <text start="883.64" dur="4.8">they knew what they were doing and then</text>
  <text start="885.77" dur="4.65">as they triggered it they started to</text>
  <text start="888.44" dur="4.32">reverse it but it was too late because</text>
  <text start="890.42" dur="4.41">the Domino&amp;#39;s were falling already and</text>
  <text start="892.76" dur="3.51">they knew that this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="894.83" dur="4.14">and they knew they were gonna have to</text>
  <text start="896.27" dur="6.26">keep interest rates very very low after</text>
  <text start="898.97" dur="7.29">the crisis of 2008 and here we are in</text>
  <text start="902.53" dur="5.86">2017 and they know exactly what they</text>
  <text start="906.26" dur="4.17">need to do to trigger a complete</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.8">collapse now at the same time if you</text>
  <text start="910.43" dur="4.05">remember Trump is doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="913.19" dur="2.76">thing in people like well what do you</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="4.44">mean he&amp;#39;s trying to collapse the economy</text>
  <text start="915.95" dur="6.45">member he doesn&amp;#39;t have the tools that</text>
  <text start="918.92" dur="5.46">the central bank has so he needs to do</text>
  <text start="922.4" dur="5.49">something completely different and that</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="7.05">is to do exactly what they have done in</text>
  <text start="927.89" dur="6.69">the past blow the bubbles up until you</text>
  <text start="931.43" dur="6.33">pop them spend as much as you can think</text>
  <text start="934.58" dur="6.69">about your household if you wanted to</text>
  <text start="937.76" dur="6.54">destroy your household what do you do</text>
  <text start="941.27" dur="5.13">you spend like crazy you take those</text>
  <text start="944.3" dur="5.28">credit cards you run them up to the max</text>
  <text start="946.4" dur="6.78">and you keep doing it you buy another</text>
  <text start="949.58" dur="7.5">car lease it you keep going until the</text>
  <text start="953.18" dur="7.26">whole thing completely collapses this is</text>
  <text start="957.08" dur="6.54">exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing these are the</text>
  <text start="960.44" dur="5.97">tools that he is using the central bank</text>
  <text start="963.62" dur="4.62">has the ability to create currency the</text>
  <text start="966.41" dur="3.87">central bank has the ability to purchase</text>
  <text start="968.24" dur="4.92">toxic real estate the central bank has</text>
  <text start="970.28" dur="5.13">the ability to raise and lower rates the</text>
  <text start="973.16" dur="3.96">central bank has the trading desk in the</text>
  <text start="975.41" dur="4.83">basement of the Fed where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.12" dur="5.969">trading stocks and stuff and we know</text>
  <text start="980.24" dur="4.65">from past reports that yes central banks</text>
  <text start="983.089" dur="4.741">around the world they are buying stocks</text>
  <text start="984.89" dur="4.23">of corporations so they all have</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="3.809">different tools</text>
  <text start="989.12" dur="5.43">to use to bring the system down and</text>
  <text start="991.639" dur="5.37">right now the Fed is going to say all</text>
  <text start="994.55" dur="5.07">their indicators are lining up and we</text>
  <text start="997.009" dur="4.711">can raise the rates because the first</text>
  <text start="999.62" dur="4.68">quarter was just an anomaly everything</text>
  <text start="1001.72" dur="4.02">is still on track and all that all</text>
  <text start="1004.3" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to do is raise it just</text>
  <text start="1005.74" dur="5.969">enough to trigger the collapse now Trump</text>
  <text start="1008.74" dur="5.699">is trying to spend and do as much as he</text>
  <text start="1011.709" dur="5.88">possibly can to blow these bubbles up</text>
  <text start="1014.439" dur="5.58">and have them pop and the reason why</text>
  <text start="1017.589" dur="4.74">he&amp;#39;s doing this because this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1020.019" dur="5.19">what the central bank has been doing</text>
  <text start="1022.329" dur="4.921">this is what past presidents have been</text>
  <text start="1025.209" dur="4.62">doing this is what Congress has been</text>
  <text start="1027.25" dur="4.14">doing so he&amp;#39;s just going along with them</text>
  <text start="1029.829" dur="2.88">showing them look let&amp;#39;s just keep</text>
  <text start="1031.39" dur="3.63">spending let&amp;#39;s keep doing what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1032.709" dur="5.49">saying because this is how it works and</text>
  <text start="1035.02" dur="5.429">he&amp;#39;s doing it in a way where he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1038.199" dur="4.46">to push it very hard to pop these</text>
  <text start="1040.449" dur="4.89">bubbles very very soon and this is why</text>
  <text start="1042.659" dur="4.451">everyone needs to be ready for what is</text>
  <text start="1045.339" dur="4.82">coming and remember when this system</text>
  <text start="1047.11" dur="5.669">comes down things are going to change</text>
  <text start="1050.159" dur="5.411">dramatically and we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="1052.779" dur="4.681">through different periods and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1055.57" dur="3.239">to be rough for many people and this is</text>
  <text start="1057.46" dur="4.439">why we&amp;#39;ve been talking about getting</text>
