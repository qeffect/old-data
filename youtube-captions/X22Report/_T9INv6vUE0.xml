  <text start="53.159" dur="5.551">now out in North Korea we understand</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="7.71">that the u.s. is using this hydrogen</text>
  <text start="58.71" dur="6.779">bomb detonation to basically bring in</text>
  <text start="63.39" dur="4.13">military assets into South Korea South</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.071">Korea is using it to up their budget and</text>
  <text start="67.52" dur="5.5">the u.s. is using it to provoke North</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="4.379">Korea because the players are always the</text>

  <text start="89.07" dur="5.159">Korea is being looked at by Russia they</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.65">want to read the fine print to see what</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="3.871">it actually says and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="3.119">analyze it and they&amp;#39;re going to come up</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="5.04">with a decision if they should veto it</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="5.641">or approve it and place new sanctions on</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="5.16">North Korea and we&amp;#39;ll follow that to see</text>
  <text start="105.3" dur="6.24">what happens there we see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="108.3" dur="5.55">is bringing in more troops into Nigeria</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="5.96">now remember this the US wanted to get</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="7.02">into Nigeria and we know that the</text>
  <text start="117.5" dur="5.56">previous president of nigeria nigeria</text>
  <text start="120.87" dur="5.22">was voted out of office new president</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="7.11">was voted in and finally the US had the</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="6.36">ability to get into nigeria because the</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="6.09">previous president was giving the u.s. a</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="6.72">very tough time basically the US wants</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="5.61">through garrison nigeria they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.849">Boko Haram this terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="3.899">has an excuse to bring in troops and</text>
  <text start="144.019" dur="3.401">originally they said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="145.769" dur="6.451">bring in troops and they&amp;#39;re only going</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="7.83">to be there for training now the troops</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="5.67">are going to be redeployed they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.349">to be moved to the front lines in the</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="3.709">war against Boko Haram and</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;ll be close to the fighting but</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="8.43">they&amp;#39;re not in combat roles then we hear</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="7.83">this before in Iraq in Syria in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="7.44">when we saw a video evidence that there</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="8.07">were US soldiers they&amp;#39;re fighting so</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="5.94">they keep and they are continually</text>
  <text start="184.57" dur="7.16">telling us these stories but we know</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="7.64">what&amp;#39;s happening here they are basically</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="7.39">invading all of these countries and</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="7.9">placing soldiers in the country to</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="8.1">garrison the country and to keep the</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="7.11">country locked into terror thinking that</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="4.32">the government needs the US and most of</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="2.13">the time they&amp;#39;re fighting against the</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="5.31">people who don&amp;#39;t like the puppet</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="5.67">government and we see this happen a lot</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="4.38">we see it all throughout the Middle East</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="8.52">in Ukraine and in many of the countries</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="7.59">in Africa now the EU because of this</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="5.87">refugee crisis it&amp;#39;s getting worse and</text>
  <text start="228.82" dur="7.77">worse as we continue down into this year</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="7.51">solberg is preparing to turn everyone</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="8.91">away and go into lockdown mode in Norway</text>
  <text start="240.07" dur="8.25">and basically saying that this whole</text>
  <text start="245.5" dur="5.79">thing is getting out of hand already</text>
  <text start="248.32" dur="5.58">seven european states have reinstated</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="4.35">border controls the Schengen free travel</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.32">zone is kind of out the window right now</text>
  <text start="255.64" dur="6.39">this is putting a lot a huge strain on</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="8.1">Greece and the whole thing is really</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="7.889">starting to fall apart right now and it</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="8.63">looks like the EU might completely break</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="7.831">down in 10 days and it will head into</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="5.26">anarchy and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="6.36">that very very closely you know out in</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="6.03">Ukraine poroshenko signed a law on the</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="5.309">ratification of an agreement with NATO</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="6.27">on founding a diplomatic mission in</text>
  <text start="289.419" dur="5.761">Ukraine the agreement foresees the</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="3.48">founding of NATO representation office</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="4.2">in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="5.97">that will consist of NATO Communications</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="5.85">Office NATO Center for information and</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="4.86">documentation the new diplomatic Oregon</text>
  <text start="305.23" dur="5.1">and his personnel receive privileges</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="4.89">like immunity cooperation given to</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="3.27">diplomatic missions in accordance with</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="6.87">the Vienna Convention on diplomatic</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="8.28">relations of 1961 and we see that NATO</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="9.6">and Ukraine are moving closer and closer</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="8.1">right on the doorstep of Russia and we</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.25">see that they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="329.98" dur="6.48">possibly can to gin up this next</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="6.56">offensive already as we know DHS was in</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="7.38">Ukraine looking at the power outage in</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="7.45">Ukraine where 225,000 customers lost</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="6.03">their power and of course they said yes</text>
  <text start="347.44" dur="5.76">this was a cyber attack yes it was from</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="6.09">Russia DHS was brought in there to</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="5.76">confirm all of this and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.78">interesting about all of this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.96" dur="5.43">saying it from a Russian hacking group</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="5.41">sandworm and we discussed this in</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="6.3">previous reports but when DHS was in</text>
  <text start="367.15" dur="7.08">Ukraine do you know they looked at no</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="7.35">evidence whatsoever all they did to make</text>
  <text start="374.23" dur="6.69">their assessment they interviewed six</text>
  <text start="378.04" dur="6.12">Ukrainian organizations affected by the</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="5.58">blackout and investigators were not able</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="4.56">to independently review technical</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="4.98">evidence and they came up with the</text>
  <text start="388.72" dur="9.42">conclusion that this cyber attack was</text>
  <text start="391.48" dur="8.31">caused by the Russian hacking group this</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="5.43">is not an investigation they didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="5.94">anything all they did was say yes we</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="5.34">believe what you&amp;#39;re saying it came from</text>
  <text start="405.73" dur="5.07">this area and you can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="4.22">doing right now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="410.8" dur="8.24">pushing the idea that Russia is</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="8.35">attacking Ukraine well they need this to</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="5.29">continually show up in the corporate</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="4.32">media they need this out there because</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="3.09">they need to make the case of why</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to be going back into the</text>
  <text start="427.42" dur="5.31">southeastern area</text>
  <text start="429.7" dur="6.33">now Obama is talking with US military</text>
  <text start="432.73" dur="7.14">officials about Libya about ground</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="7.5">troops about how they should go in and</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="6.3">fight the Islamic state which we know</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="4.14">this is not what they&amp;#39;re doing because</text>
  <text start="446.17" dur="4.83">we know the Islamic state was airlifted</text>
  <text start="447.67" dur="6.36">from Syria by guitar by Saudi Arabia by</text>
  <text start="451" dur="4.62">turkey by the u.s. into Libya at the</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="3.99">same time Russia was bombing this is</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="3.63">when we saw the buildup in Libya and we</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="3.39">know they&amp;#39;re trying to get this unity</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="5.4">government in place because they need to</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="6.21">be invited in so the world looks at this</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.55">and says no they were invited in they</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="6.87">have our permission but we know that</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="9.05">France we know that the u.s. they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="8.22">already in Libya and they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="5.14">covert ops inside of Libya right now the</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="6.38">report says that France has about a</text>
  <text start="484.39" dur="9.03">hundred and eighty special op teams in</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="6.88">Libya right now and of course the news</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="4.53">broke that they did and we can see that</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="5.73">there are other coalition forces that</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="6.99">are already in Libya they already have a</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="4.11">plan they&amp;#39;re all ready to go like I said</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re just waiting for that green</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="6.53">light now a drone crashed into turkey</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.64">near the Syrian border the drone is</text>
  <text start="512.34" dur="6.85">unidentified and they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="7.26">clear which nation was operating the</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="6.21">unmanned drone and I&amp;#39;m sure that turkey</text>
  <text start="523.09" dur="4.65">would love to blame this on Syria but</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ll have to see if this goes anywhere</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="5.46">or this story just completely disappears</text>
  <text start="530.14" dur="4.53">because the the false flag didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="4.95">out the way they wanted it to work out</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="6.69">now Russia has parliamentary polls</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="5.49">elections coming up in September and</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="4.8">Putin is out there warning that foreign</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="4.98">enemies are preparing themselves for</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="4.14">these elections adding that the security</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="3.69">services must be ready to prevent any</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="4.62">outside interference in the elections</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="6.21">and they recently passed a foreign</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="5.73">agents law basically making it illegal</text>
  <text start="558.52" dur="3.739">for Russian political parties to receive</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="4.429">sponsorship</text>
  <text start="562.259" dur="6.531">from or enter into business deals with</text>
  <text start="565.079" dur="5.73">NGOs that have foreign agent status and</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="4.509">maybe we should have something like that</text>
  <text start="570.809" dur="4.11">here in the US because we probably</text>
  <text start="573.299" dur="4.02">should ban lobbyists we should probably</text>
  <text start="574.919" dur="5.4">ban corporations from donating to</text>
  <text start="577.319" dur="5.24">certain parties we should probably ban</text>
  <text start="580.319" dur="5.01">other foreign governments coming in and</text>
  <text start="582.559" dur="5.89">supporting different candidates actually</text>
  <text start="585.329" dur="5.16">most likely we should put all the</text>
  <text start="588.449" dur="5.461">candidates on an even playing field and</text>
  <text start="590.489" dur="5.52">say this is your allotment and you know</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="3.899">what you&amp;#39;re going to have to succeed on</text>
  <text start="596.009" dur="6.72">what you&amp;#39;re going to do for the people</text>
  <text start="597.809" dur="7.53">period that&amp;#39;s it no more donations no</text>
  <text start="602.729" dur="7.38">more special interest groups none of</text>
  <text start="605.339" dur="9.12">this now the US a dove Vandenberg Air</text>
  <text start="610.109" dur="8.73">Force Base in California they launched</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="6.33">an ICBM a nuclear ICBM of course there</text>
  <text start="618.839" dur="4.74">is no nuclear warheads on this one but</text>
  <text start="620.789" dur="8.55">this is the second time this week they</text>
  <text start="623.579" dur="8.901">did this now they did the first 17 days</text>
  <text start="629.339" dur="7.02">ago and they decide to do another one</text>
  <text start="632.48" dur="9.189">the question is are they just testing or</text>
  <text start="636.359" dur="9.9">are they sending a message well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.669" dur="8.72">sending a message it landed about a half</text>
  <text start="646.259" dur="7.711">hour later it flew about 4,200 miles and</text>
  <text start="650.389" dur="7.99">it came down near the marshall islands</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="8.239">of the South Pacific now instead of</text>
  <text start="658.379" dur="6.99">passing this off as another routine test</text>
  <text start="662.209" dur="5.95">the deputy defense secretary Robert work</text>
  <text start="665.369" dur="5.851">who went is the launch said the u.s.</text>
  <text start="668.159" dur="8.191">tests conducted at least 15 times since</text>
  <text start="671.22" dur="7.799">2011 send a message to strategic rivals</text>
  <text start="676.35" dur="5.519">like Russia China North Korea if you</text>
  <text start="679.019" dur="5.87">notice all the players are the same that</text>
  <text start="681.869" dur="6.18">Washington has an effective nuclear</text>
  <text start="684.889" dur="6.99">arsenal and he said that&amp;#39;s why we do</text>
  <text start="688.049" dur="3.83">this really</text>
  <text start="691.889" dur="7.14">what it&amp;#39;s saying is that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="693.749" dur="8.52">prepared to use nuclear weapons to</text>
  <text start="699.029" dur="6.451">defend the country or if they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="702.269" dur="7.11">the war because the US when all else</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="6.329">fails they will turn to their nuclear</text>
  <text start="709.379" dur="3.63">arsenal and they will use the nuclear</text>
  <text start="711.809" dur="5.7">weapons and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="713.009" dur="7.38">about all of this is that Obama if you</text>
  <text start="717.509" dur="6.98">remember going back in time here when he</text>
  <text start="720.389" dur="8.841">was that when he was at first in office</text>
  <text start="724.489" dur="9.52">he won that Nobel Peace Prize because</text>
  <text start="729.23" dur="9.31">his plan was to reduce us dependence on</text>
  <text start="734.009" dur="7.62">atomic weapons Obama called for a world</text>
  <text start="738.54" dur="6.299">eventually free of nuclear arms in a</text>
  <text start="741.629" dur="6.661">speech in Prague and later reached a new</text>
  <text start="744.839" dur="6">strategic weapons treaty with Russia he</text>
  <text start="748.29" dur="7.699">received the nobel peace prize for this</text>
  <text start="750.839" dur="5.15">on his stance on reducing atomic arms</text>
  <text start="756.559" dur="12.4">now he boosts the spending for nuclear</text>
  <text start="763.529" dur="9.9">weapons and the u.s. is sending messages</text>
  <text start="768.959" dur="9.68">to the world that we will use nuclear</text>
  <text start="773.429" dur="5.21">weapons if you don&amp;#39;t do what we say</text>
  <text start="778.879" dur="8.83">we&amp;#39;re reaching the next level here this</text>
  <text start="782.759" dur="8.04">this reminds me of two Apes who are</text>
  <text start="787.709" dur="6.09">getting ready to battle and each one has</text>
  <text start="790.799" dur="5.551">a stick and they&amp;#39;re pounding it on the</text>
  <text start="793.799" dur="5.28">ground and throwing rocks to show listen</text>

  <text start="914.71" dur="9.21">that the world will be watching the</text>

  <text start="962.689" dur="5.7">choice of voting them in power or out of</text>
  <text start="965.029" dur="6.93">power but basically it sounds like he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1018.97" dur="6.329">natural resources and build a pipeline</text>
  <text start="1021.009" dur="9.751">and then eventually go into a ram so we</text>
  <text start="1025.299" dur="10.1">see right now Russia Syria they know</text>
  <text start="1030.76" dur="7.5">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on here we see the</text>
  <text start="1035.399" dur="5.201">Obama administration they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="1038.26" dur="5.819">internal discussions on military options</text>

  <text start="1044.079" dur="3.6">continually telling us that it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1045.549" dur="5.22">to fail because they already have</text>
  <text start="1047.679" dur="5.671">another plan in the works now remember</text>
  <text start="1050.769" dur="6.12">all their plans they just don&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="1053.35" dur="6.51">a lot of them don&amp;#39;t work just like back</text>

  <text start="1068.44" dur="3.119">made a deal with the u.s. saying listen</text>

  <text start="1071.559" dur="4.921">weapons are you satisfied with this deal</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="4.59">because the US at that point and the</text>
  <text start="1076.48" dur="5.1">world said wait what are you doing here</text>
  <text start="1078.82" dur="4.92">you have no proof and the US couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1081.58" dur="6.24">get any traction in Congress to go to</text>
  <text start="1083.74" dur="6.99">war and this is why they back down at</text>
  <text start="1087.82" dur="7.91">that time but he&amp;#39;s looking and discussed</text>
