  <text start="168.92" dur="4.59">they up by 0.1 percent point 2 percent</text>
  <text start="171.35" dur="4.35">because last year sales were absolutely</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.229">awful but what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="3.629">now is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of retailers</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="4.951">that are still closing stores a lot of</text>
  <text start="179.329" dur="7.291">mists quietly closing stores which we</text>

  <text start="186.62" dur="3.839">that everything that government</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="4.89">everything the cabal has done everything</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="5.101">the central bank has done well it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="4.89">to the betterment of the people the</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="4.92">everyday person on the street now we</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="3.599">know we have Social Security we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.48" dur="3.39">supposed to contribute to Social</text>
  <text start="201.799" dur="3.3">Security because as we get to the</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="3.959">retirement age which you were supposed</text>
  <text start="205.099" dur="4.98">to access that money and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="207.829" dur="5.22">telling us for years that that money</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="5.341">might not be there and we know that</text>
  <text start="213.049" dur="6.391">millions and millions of people depend</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="6.209">on it a lot of the older generation who</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="4.769">was retired already maybe they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="221.629" dur="6.091">get a pension they&amp;#39;re living off of</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="5.701">Social Security and the Social Security</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="5.25">Administration it self reports that 62</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="5.34">percent of recipients they rely on the</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.97">program for at least half of their</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="5.25">income and what we&amp;#39;re seeing which is</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="4.139">this is coming out of the center of</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="7.26">Budget and Policy Priorities it shows</text>
  <text start="243.079" dur="6.391">that without Social Security 22 point 1</text>
  <text start="247.76" dur="4.339">million Americans would fall below the</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="8.25">poverty line and that is just absolutely</text>
  <text start="252.099" dur="8.86">awful and we need to remember this money</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="5.58">that we the people put into this that</text>
  <text start="260.959" dur="5.281">wasn&amp;#39;t the government&amp;#39;s money it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="5.16">money that we put into the system which</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re supposed to get back at retirement</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="9.179">but the government accessed our money</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="8.579">once again and we know that if they cut</text>
  <text start="277.639" dur="6.661">Social Security which again is our money</text>
  <text start="280.639" dur="6.991">they used it to fund you know all their</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="6.989">other entitlement programs Wars and</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="6.9">other things and again this leaves the</text>
  <text start="291.289" dur="6.931">people with nothing and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="7.169">seeing here is that people are living</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="7.43">longer which means you need more of that</text>
  <text start="301.699" dur="7.171">money to support these individuals and</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="5.92">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is a disaster</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="6.12">now according to the 2017 trustees</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="6.98">report it looks like the trust fund</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.49">reserves they will be gone by 2035 and</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="3.85">we&amp;#39;re in 28</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="4.86">right now which it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="5.79">here we&amp;#39;re in 2018 and then everything</text>
  <text start="325.34" dur="6.02">is fine up to 2035 every year from this</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="6.24">year on there&amp;#39;s less and less and less</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="6.22">which means they can&amp;#39;t support all these</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="5.97">people and they&amp;#39;re giving us a date that</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="7.32">this is when it comes to an end that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="7.11">it and one of their solutions is a</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="5.13">permanent reduction in benefits to all</text>
  <text start="347.51" dur="4.53">current and future Social Security</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="4.58">recipients and when you also need to</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="5.7">remember in this is a really great point</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="5.05">since the government has been telling us</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="5.19">that there&amp;#39;s low employment and everyone</text>
  <text start="359.66" dur="5.76">is employed then we should see a lot</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="5.66">more of these funds being put into</text>
  <text start="365.42" dur="6.15">Social Security but guess what</text>
  <text start="368.59" dur="7.69">since the labor force participation rate</text>
  <text start="371.57" dur="7.17">is near multi-decade lows that money is</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="5.37">not being funneled into Social Security</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="6.54">this tells you that everyone does not</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="7.47">have those high-paying quality jobs yes</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="6.03">they might have part-time jobs and again</text>
  <text start="389.12" dur="4.41">they count them as full-time jobs but</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="6.24">that means they&amp;#39;re gonna be putting in a</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="8.09">lot less into the system because you</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="6.78">need to understand that the entire</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="6.37">requirement for Social Security to work</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="6.54">means the following social social</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="9.48">security requires three employed workers</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="9.54">to support one retiree and once again if</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="5.76">these three employed workers are not</text>
  <text start="420.41" dur="4.77">full-time and they&amp;#39;re getting paid a</text>
  <text start="423.23" dur="4.83">certain amount of money they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="425.18" dur="7.86">support the one right retiree it just</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="8.64">doesn&amp;#39;t work and in 2010 it dipped below</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="7.92">three for the first time and in 2013 it</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="8.73">hit 2.8 and right now it&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="9.45">2.2 and again these are low quality jobs</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="7.53">which cannot support the system so if we</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="3.869">put all this into context we have a</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="4.769">Social Security</text>
  <text start="454.279" dur="5.94">we have a pension problem we have an</text>
  <text start="457.729" dur="5.4">economic problem where everything&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="6.18">manipulated and it&amp;#39;s showing up in all</text>
  <text start="463.129" dur="6.3">of this data and it tells you there are</text>
  <text start="466.399" dur="7.47">major problems headed our way now I</text>
  <text start="469.429" dur="6.69">think the elite I think those who were</text>
  <text start="473.869" dur="6.42">in the inside and those people who are</text>
  <text start="476.119" dur="6.48">might be on the run for various reasons</text>
  <text start="480.289" dur="5.01">I think they all know this because</text>
  <text start="482.599" dur="5.31">something interesting happened and this</text>
  <text start="485.299" dur="6.42">might not have anything to do with those</text>
  <text start="487.909" dur="5.31">people but what they stole is very</text>
  <text start="491.719" dur="3.81">interesting now we&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="493.219" dur="4.71">everyone you know you need to have gold</text>
  <text start="495.529" dur="4.41">and silver because that&amp;#39;s real money and</text>
  <text start="497.929" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;m talking about the physical gold the</text>
  <text start="499.939" dur="7.08">physical silver not the ETF&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="503.089" dur="6.93">paper because we understand that you can</text>
  <text start="507.019" dur="5.37">use this later on it ensures your wealth</text>
  <text start="510.019" dur="5.221">when the dollar collapses or paper</text>
  <text start="512.389" dur="6.481">currency collapses gold retains its</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="4.799">value now what&amp;#39;s very interesting if</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="1.889">you&amp;#39;re going to steal something maybe</text>
  <text start="520.039" dur="2.1">they could have done it with</text>
  <text start="520.759" dur="4.851">cryptocurrencies maybe they could have</text>
  <text start="522.139" dur="6.091">you know got ahold of someone&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="525.61" dur="3.43">address transferred the money through</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="2.64">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="7.769">it would have been there instantaneously</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="9.269">but they decided to rob Brinks of eleven</text>
  <text start="536.809" dur="6.03">million dollars in gold shipment why</text>
  <text start="540.139" dur="6.42">didn&amp;#39;t they steal eleven million dollars</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="7.11">in paper currency this is very</text>
  <text start="546.559" dur="5.491">interesting because if you were in the</text>
  <text start="549.949" dur="4.56">inside if you&amp;#39;re an insider you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.82">elite and you knew what was coming down</text>
  <text start="554.509" dur="5.971">the pike you would say hmm I understand</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="7.05">I need to get my hands on a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="5.909">and you can melt it down you can recast</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="1.62">it you can do all different things with</text>
  <text start="566.389" dur="3.361">it</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="6.33">and this robbery is the 12th biggest</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="6.569">gold heist in history now this was</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="5.1">stolen in December now think about</text>
  <text start="576.319" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s happening right now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="577.97" dur="5.039">discussing it all with the petrol you</text>
  <text start="580.069" dur="5.64">wann with the dollar there&amp;#39;s the threat</text>
  <text start="583.009" dur="4.951">to the dollar right now other countries</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="5.491">are moving away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="5.04">why didn&amp;#39;t they steal dollars that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="5.1">very interesting</text>
  <text start="593" dur="5.64">now the World Bank came out and they</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="5.67">have this new report and the report</text>
  <text start="598.64" dur="6.39">shows a lack of investments a slowdown</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="6.3">in productivity and tightening monetary</text>
  <text start="605.03" dur="6.06">policy now the bank has raised its</text>
  <text start="608.27" dur="5.43">projections for global growth from 2.7</text>
  <text start="611.09" dur="5.64">percent to 3 percent even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="5.58">putting out a warning now the central</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.83">bankers they like to do this they always</text>
  <text start="619.28" dur="4.86">tell you that yes everything&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="5.37">grow it&amp;#39;s going to be fantastic except</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="4.26">for these certain areas and this is what</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="4.89">we need to watch because they could</text>
  <text start="628.4" dur="6.51">bring down the system and it warned that</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="5.31">the acceleration in growth would be</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="4.71">temporary unless government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="5.76">implemented structural reforms to raise</text>
  <text start="639.62" dur="5.01">long term growth potential now remember</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="3.78">they didn&amp;#39;t mention anything about debt</text>
  <text start="644.63" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re really talking about is you need</text>
  <text start="646.67" dur="4.14">to do something because there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="5.52">amount of debt out there and if we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="4.53">you know rein this in and pay for it</text>
  <text start="653.84" dur="4.29">somehow the whole system&amp;#39;s coming down</text>
  <text start="655.34" dur="4.86">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="658.13" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re saying that the developed</text>
  <text start="660.2" dur="4.89">countries they&amp;#39;re the ones who are going</text>
  <text start="662.84" dur="5.07">to have the problem the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="665.09" dur="5">they are starting from the ground level</text>
  <text start="667.91" dur="4.74">and working up that developed countries</text>
  <text start="670.09" dur="3.85">they&amp;#39;re the ones who have the problem</text>
  <text start="672.65" dur="3.45">because most of these developed</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="5.09">countries aren&amp;#39;t a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="676.1" dur="5.88">they don&amp;#39;t produce that much anymore and</text>
  <text start="679.03" dur="5.89">most of the countries are service type</text>
  <text start="681.98" dur="5.31">of countries so let&amp;#39;s put this into</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="4.8">perspective they&amp;#39;re saying the emerging</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="4.92">markets the BRIC countries they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="6.78">to be growing the developed countries</text>
  <text start="692.21" dur="6.9">well their economic structure is in the</text>
  <text start="696.5" dur="5.22">crosshairs they&amp;#39;re gonna have problems</text>
  <text start="699.11" dur="7.92">and they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="701.72" dur="7.73">decade of gloom for these countries now</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="6.54">we know we&amp;#39;re going through some type of</text>
  <text start="709.45" dur="7.06">transition we know that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="5.67">be problems and things will eventually</text>
  <text start="716.51" dur="5.43">get better but in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="6.61">we&amp;#39;re going to have problems now yeah</text>
  <text start="721.94" dur="6.43">temporarily with Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan a lot</text>
  <text start="725.85" dur="4.98">of the currency that are sitting in the</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="3.72">the banks in other countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.83" dur="3.75">gonna be flowing back to the United</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="4.44">States which is going to hurt those</text>
  <text start="734.58" dur="3.99">banks the and and those other countries</text>
  <text start="736.53" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s going to prop up the United</text>
  <text start="738.57" dur="4.56">States and if we go back in time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="740.82" dur="5.16">seen this right before the Great</text>
  <text start="743.13" dur="5.67">Depression where Europe you know came</text>
  <text start="745.98" dur="6">down and the United States was in the</text>
  <text start="748.8" dur="5.25">roaring 20s and everything was fine and</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="3.75">then eventually hit the United States</text>
  <text start="754.05" dur="3.78">and I think this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="755.73" dur="4.11">happen I think it&amp;#39;s gonna start on the</text>
  <text start="757.83" dur="5.79">outer edges and it&amp;#39;s gonna work its way</text>
  <text start="759.84" dur="8.49">in what Trump is done right now is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="6.72">buying the United States sometime time</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="3.96">before the whole thing comes down now</text>
  <text start="770.34" dur="3.69">when you bring in a lot more currency</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="4.83">and you bring in investment dollars</text>
  <text start="774.03" dur="5.73">you&amp;#39;re gonna see the economy boost a</text>
  <text start="777.12" dur="4.74">little bit and we will see it boost a</text>
  <text start="779.76" dur="4.94">little bit before everything starts to</text>
  <text start="781.86" dur="7.62">come down this is it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="784.7" dur="6.88">druggie who gets it&amp;#39;s his fix takes the</text>
  <text start="789.48" dur="4.8">drug gets the high for a little while</text>
  <text start="791.58" dur="4.82">but then can&amp;#39;t find anymore drugs and</text>
  <text start="794.28" dur="4.74">then the whole thing comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="5.14">this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see but this</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="5.28">is part of the process this is what</text>
  <text start="801.54" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re going to see happen here because</text>
  <text start="804.3" dur="7.4">everything needs to be squared away</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="7.7">remember we&amp;#39;re coming off a cabal system</text>
  <text start="811.7" dur="5.68">where everything was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="814.91" dur="5.28">completely different than what it is</text>
  <text start="817.38" dur="5.7">today the TPP was supposed to be passed</text>
  <text start="820.19" dur="6.37">we&amp;#39;re supposed to have a court system</text>
  <text start="823.08" dur="5.61">that was above all other governments the</text>
  <text start="826.56" dur="4.8">United States the Cabal was gonna be</text>
  <text start="828.69" dur="5.28">calling the shots around the world they</text>
  <text start="831.36" dur="4.32">were going to try to assure in a one</text>
  <text start="833.97" dur="4.43">currency one government type of</text>
  <text start="835.68" dur="5.88">situation they were trying to bring in</text>
  <text start="838.4" dur="5.08">third-world factory workers in the</text>
  <text start="841.56" dur="6.27">United States because once you have a</text>
  <text start="843.48" dur="8.7">one currency and court systems above the</text>
  <text start="847.83" dur="5.67">governments they call the shots and what</text>
  <text start="852.18" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna lay</text>
  <text start="853.5" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna make everything even</text>
  <text start="855.63" dur="6.47">I can even out the playing field across</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="8.39">the world that that was their plan and</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="7.03">everything would be the same now</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="4.45">everything has to be undone everything</text>
  <text start="869.13" dur="2.67">that they&amp;#39;ve done in the past has to be</text>
  <text start="871.14" dur="3.77">undone</text>
  <text start="871.8" dur="6.6">so we need some time to do this because</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="5.05">we what I think is gonna happen is Trump</text>
  <text start="878.4" dur="3.48">is going to make a move to get rid of</text>
  <text start="879.96" dur="4.65">the central banking system here in the</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="4.65">United States I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="884.61" dur="4.95">happen here is that United States is</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="6.39">gonna be joining the one belt one road</text>
  <text start="889.56" dur="5.25">system manufacturing will eventually</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="3.24">come back to the United States maybe not</text>
  <text start="894.81" dur="4.68">in the way that we had it before</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="5.46">but some type of manufacturing maybe</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="4.38">advanced manufacturing will come back to</text>
  <text start="901.62" dur="4.35">the United States but before all this</text>
  <text start="903.87" dur="3.93">happens the United States need to be</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="2.94">needs to be prepared for this because</text>
  <text start="907.8" dur="2.61">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through this period of</text>
  <text start="908.91" dur="4.98">time where we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="910.41" dur="5.58">transition and I think this is what is</text>
  <text start="913.89" dur="5.94">happening right now where everything is</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="6.51">being reversed everything the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="919.83" dur="4.41">central banks here the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="922.5" dur="5.13">doing everything needs to be reversed</text>
  <text start="924.24" dur="5.7">and you need to have some time now what</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="929.94" dur="5.01">central bank is gonna you know just go</text>
  <text start="932.58" dur="4.44">along with this they&amp;#39;ve been ruling the</text>
  <text start="934.95" dur="4.32">world for quite a while they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="937.02" dur="4.02">this in the past yes they&amp;#39;ve been thrown</text>
  <text start="939.27" dur="4.17">out of countries but they found their</text>
  <text start="941.04" dur="4.92">way back into countries and I think</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s a battle going on not just with</text>
  <text start="945.96" dur="3.36">the Cabal but with the central banking</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="3.26">system I don&amp;#39;t believe they&amp;#39;re one in</text>
  <text start="949.32" dur="4.65">the same they work together sometimes</text>
  <text start="951.17" dur="4.96">but they&amp;#39;re not one in the same and I</text>
  <text start="953.97" dur="5.07">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="6.15">going to see the battle increase as time</text>
  <text start="959.04" dur="5.1">goes on because even though even though</text>
  <text start="962.28" dur="3.69">Trump is you know fighting against the</text>
  <text start="964.14" dur="4.14">Cabal getting rid of those individuals</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="5.94">he still is going to have to go up</text>
  <text start="968.28" dur="6.21">against the central bank and this whole</text>
  <text start="971.91" dur="5.55">thing is going to go on for a little</text>
  <text start="974.49" dur="6.3">while longer and he needs to prep the</text>
  <text start="977.46" dur="5.58">economy for this and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="4.29">that if you really think about it is to</text>
  <text start="983.04" dur="3.9">pump the stock market up to make</text>
  <text start="985.08" dur="4.65">everyone think that everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="986.94" dur="5.61">well get the tax bill</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="4.53">past so he can bring more currency bring</text>
  <text start="992.55" dur="3.779">that investment dollar back to United</text>
  <text start="994.26" dur="4.29">States I mean this is just a band-aid</text>
  <text start="996.329" dur="6.181">fix it&amp;#39;s not gonna fix everything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="998.55" dur="7.14">only temporary and it gives him time</text>
  <text start="1002.51" dur="5.189">while he dismantles everything that</text>
  <text start="1005.69" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;ve put into place over the years</text>
  <text start="1007.699" dur="3.421">and then we&amp;#39;re gonna go through the</text>
  <text start="1009.529" dur="4.651">transition now is there going to be a</text>
  <text start="1011.12" dur="6.24">hard break a soft break into this new</text>
  <text start="1014.18" dur="6.33">system we don&amp;#39;t know yet because we</text>
  <text start="1017.36" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t know how this is all gonna work</text>
  <text start="1020.51" dur="5.579">out so no matter what you&amp;#39;re gonna need</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="4.8">to be prepared for this because we can</text>
  <text start="1026.089" dur="5.431">see we&amp;#39;re heading down this path and if</text>
  <text start="1029.15" dur="4.799">he continued if he continually does what</text>
  <text start="1031.52" dur="4.409">he does we&amp;#39;re gonna get closer and</text>
  <text start="1033.949" dur="3.6">closer to that time where we head into</text>
  <text start="1035.929" dur="4.5">that transition now a lot of people back</text>
  <text start="1037.549" dur="5.4">in the 70s didn&amp;#39;t even realize we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1040.429" dur="5.611">coming off the gold standard onto the</text>
  <text start="1042.949" dur="4.681">petrodollar system now remember the</text>
  <text start="1046.04" dur="3.69">United States back then was the reserve</text>
  <text start="1047.63" dur="3.66">currency so the United States was the</text>
  <text start="1049.73" dur="4.26">reserve currency they were still the</text>
  <text start="1051.29" dur="6.06">reserve currency it just switched how</text>
  <text start="1053.99" dur="5.61">the internal workings were working the</text>
  <text start="1057.35" dur="4.65">central bankers had checks and balances</text>
  <text start="1059.6" dur="5.069">with gold they got off the checks and</text>
  <text start="1062" dur="6.63">balances and went on to their system</text>
  <text start="1064.669" dur="6.901">with the help of the Cabal and we see</text>
  <text start="1068.63" dur="5.429">right now that this time around the</text>
  <text start="1071.57" dur="3.84">transition is not going from the United</text>
  <text start="1074.059" dur="2.911">States reserve currency to the United</text>
  <text start="1075.41" dur="2.97">States reserve currency it&amp;#39;s going from</text>
  <text start="1076.97" dur="4.38">the United States reserve currency to</text>
  <text start="1078.38" dur="6.81">another country being the reserve</text>
  <text start="1081.35" dur="6.36">country or an SDR or something else so</text>
  <text start="1085.19" dur="5.19">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="1087.71" dur="5.459">different and I think this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1090.38" dur="5.4">buying time setting things up and making</text>
  <text start="1093.169" dur="5.551">sure that we go through some type of</text>
  <text start="1095.78" dur="6.12">soft transition where it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as</text>
  <text start="1098.72" dur="5.31">many people as it would have before but</text>
  <text start="1101.9" dur="5.7">the soft transition is still going to be</text>
  <text start="1104.03" dur="5.76">very difficult and just like coming on</text>
  <text start="1107.6" dur="5.48">to the petrodollar system people</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="6.42">couldn&amp;#39;t find work you couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel</text>
  <text start="1113.08" dur="5.079">in you know back then interest rates</text>
  <text start="1116.21" dur="5.55">were rising now we&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="1118.159" dur="5.4">different situation because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1121.76" dur="3.93">trading one system here for</text>
  <text start="1123.559" dur="4.23">another system here we&amp;#39;re trading this</text>
  <text start="1125.69" dur="4.979">system for someone else&amp;#39;s system</text>
  <text start="1127.789" dur="5.37">someplace else and that&amp;#39;s gonna make it</text>
  <text start="1130.669" dur="4.71">a lot more difficult here in the United</text>
  <text start="1133.159" dur="4.4">States so no matter what you need to be</text>
