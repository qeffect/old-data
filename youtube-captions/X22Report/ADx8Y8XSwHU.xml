  <text start="38.43" dur="5.73">date is December 16th 2018 and the tout</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="4.2">of the episode is mainstream media</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="5.04">prepping for the falling hammer we knew</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="4.83">this was coming let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="4.35">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="4.619">geopolitical news now everything the</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="4.71">deep state the globalists have set up it</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="5.07">seems like one piece at a time is being</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.049">chipped away and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="4.351">that a lot of things that they tried to</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="4.921">do are completely unconstitutional and</text>
  <text start="64.98" dur="4.11">it was not in the benefit of the people</text>
  <text start="67.23" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve been saying for a very long time</text>
  <text start="69.09" dur="3.87">that Obamacare was never for the people</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.41">you should never have to force someone</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="5.25">into doing something by using a penalty</text>
  <text start="76.05" dur="4.56">because if something is fantastic and</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="4.53">something is so incredible you would</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="5.97">just go ahead and you would get it</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="6.63">because it&amp;#39;s that good you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="6.75">force people into it and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="89.37" dur="6.99">about Obamacare now a US District in</text>
  <text start="93.33" dur="4.86">Texas judge Reed O&amp;#39;Connor has agreed</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="3.68">with a coalition of 19 states that</text>
  <text start="98.19" dur="3.81">Obamacare is structurally</text>
  <text start="100.04" dur="4.15">unconstitutional without an enforced</text>
  <text start="102" dur="4.86">federal mandate that requires individual</text>
  <text start="104.19" dur="4.47">participation absent the enforcement of</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="3.54">the individual mandate judge O&amp;#39;Connor</text>
  <text start="108.66" dur="4.95">ruled it was impossible for the Obama</text>
  <text start="110.4" dur="5.07">care to law to remain Texas and the 19th</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="4.29">state coalition successfully argued</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ve been harmed by an increase in a</text>
  <text start="117.9" dur="4.17">number of people on state funded</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="6">insurance rolls we also when we looked</text>
  <text start="122.07" dur="5.19">at this we saw how insurance was going</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="4.169">up for the middle class many people</text>
  <text start="127.26" dur="4.47">could not afford this insurance it was</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="5.551">getting out of hand and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="5.19">exchanges went completely bankrupt so</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="3.539">the plaintiffs argued when Congress</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="3.599">repealed the tax penalty last year for</text>
  <text start="138.599" dur="4.11">the individual mandate they eliminated</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="4.891">the US Supreme Court&amp;#39;s prior rationale</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="5.821">for finding the affordable care act</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="5.85">constitutional in 2012 and the Texas</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.739">judge agreed now Trump has been trying</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="5.97">to get rid of Obamacare I believe this</text>
  <text start="153.269" dur="6.421">is one of his campaign promises and they</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="4.71">tried and they tried and tried Congress</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="3.9">kept on shooting it down</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="3.57">and they&amp;#39;ve actually gave up and then</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="4.44">eventually they got rid of the mandate</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.7">and that went into effect I believe this</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="5.19">year and we see that Trump now is</text>
  <text start="171.21" dur="3.03">tweeting out and he says the following</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="3.12">Wow</text>
  <text start="174.24" dur="4.77">but not surprisingly Obamacare was just</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="4.95">ruled unconstitutional by a highly</text>
  <text start="179.01" dur="4.65">respected judge in Texas great news for</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="4.74">America you also said as I predicted all</text>
  <text start="183.66" dur="4.83">along Obamacare has been struck down as</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="4.77">an unconstitutional disaster now</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="4.68">Congress must pass a strong law that</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.74">provides great health care and protects</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="6.84">pre-existing conditions Mitch and Nancy</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="7.86">get it done so here we are and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="6.3">pushing for real health care now if this</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="4.97">plan is good if the plan comes out and</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s good for every American</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="5.23">there should be no tax penalties they</text>
  <text start="211.53" dur="3.39">shouldn&amp;#39;t have to force you into it it</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="2.61">should be something where everyone looks</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="4.08">at it and says you know something this</text>
  <text start="216.21" dur="5.64">is fantastic it&amp;#39;s very low cost and I</text>
  <text start="219" dur="5.91">can afford this and this benefits my</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="5.01">families if they have to tell you over</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="3.27">and over how great it is and they have</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="4.94">to push you into it</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="6.09">it won&amp;#39;t be good now it looks like</text>
  <text start="231.8" dur="5.65">California Attorney General as Xavier</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="5.43">Baqarah well they&amp;#39;re putting together a</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="4.55">coalition of democratic attorneys that</text>
  <text start="239.7" dur="5.009">are going to try to appeal this ruling</text>
  <text start="242" dur="4.45">so there&amp;#39;s going to be a battle going on</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="3.541">remember the deep state in these</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.11">individuals they&amp;#39;re not just gonna sit</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="4.86">back and let these things happen but I</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.41">think right now Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="4.08">have the upper hand I do believe they</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="3.84">are in control we see Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="4.47">Robert Mueller turned over the 302</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="5.43">interview report Friday that had been</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="5.37">requested by US District Judge mg</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="4.74">Sullivan in Washington and Michael</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="3.48">Flynn&amp;#39;s defense team claimed he was</text>
  <text start="268.98" dur="4.65">pressured not to bring a lawyer to his</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="5.82">January 24 2017 interview with the FBI</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="5.46">agents now the original 302 report is</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="5.04">referenced in the 302 submitted but it</text>
  <text start="279.09" dur="4.11">does not appear to have been provided to</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="4.32">the court now that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="4.11">the 302 submitted to the court includes</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="3.6">a number of interesting revelations</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="4.47">including the agents decided that they</text>
  <text start="289.29" dur="5.01">would not warn Flynn that it was a crime</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.289">to be to lie during FBI interview</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="3.78">because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed</text>
  <text start="296.069" dur="4.44">and they were concerned that giving the</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="5.82">warning might adversely affect the rapa</text>
  <text start="300.509" dur="6.24">poor with the Asians the 302 also notes</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="5.19">that Flynn did not give any indicators</text>
  <text start="306.749" dur="4.771">of deception and that struck and other</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="4.829">agents whose names was redacted from</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="4.829">these reports both had the impression</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="4.891">that at the time that Flynn was not</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="4.741">lying or did not think he was lying</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="5.46">now this completely contradicts what</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="5.699">Comey said because Comey told the House</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="5.07">investigative panel under oath that the</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="6.211">conclusion of the investigators was he</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="7.02">was obviously lying and it looks like</text>
  <text start="333" dur="6.18">Comey might be caught in a lie because</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="5.07">it seems like everything is unraveling</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.039">right now so Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="4.65">following Wow</text>
  <text start="343.219" dur="3.25">19,000 texts between Lisa Paige and her</text>

  <text start="351.509" dur="4.861">wiped clean and gone such a big story</text>
  <text start="354.599" dur="6.12">that will never be covered by the fake</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="6.24">news witch-hunt so Trump lately has been</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="4.47">tweeting out a lot of these tweets</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="6.269">against Comey against truck and page</text>

  <text start="368.879" dur="2.04">witch-hunt</text>
  <text start="369.449" dur="3.74">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="370.919" dur="6.12">just a minute but first we know that</text>
  <text start="373.189" dur="6.91">Judicial Watch forced Hillary Clinton to</text>
  <text start="377.039" dur="5.37">testify under oath now she did this in</text>
  <text start="380.099" dur="6">written form she didn&amp;#39;t appear in front</text>
  <text start="382.409" dur="7.171">of the court and she handed over all her</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="6.63">answers to the questions and in the</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="4.889">ruling from Sullivan he ordered Clinton</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="4.71">to describe the creation of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="5.281">email dot-com system including who</text>
  <text start="397.439" dur="4.38">decided to create the system the day the</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="4.379">day it was decided to create the system</text>
  <text start="401.819" dur="5.041">why it was created who set it up and</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="5.07">when it became operational now Clinton</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="4.32">responded to the question saying that</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="3.9">she was aware that President Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="4.079">office had set up an email system but</text>
  <text start="413.099" dur="5.16">she had no role in this process</text>
  <text start="415.259" dur="5.46">so Justin Cooper who was the former</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="4.62">adviser of Bill Clinton who had</text>
  <text start="420.719" dur="4.081">allegedly set up the controversial email</text>
  <text start="422.879" dur="4.35">server Cooper later admitted in an FBI</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.349">report to destroying Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="429.149" dur="3.62">in</text>
  <text start="429.439" dur="5.641">or hitting them with a hammer now</text>
  <text start="432.769" dur="5.13">Clinton was also ordered to respond to a</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="5.309">question about a 2015 testimony before</text>
  <text start="437.899" dur="4.29">the US House of Representatives Select</text>
  <text start="440.389" dur="4.35">Committee on Benghazi during which she</text>

  <text start="444.739" dur="4.53">were in the state&amp;#39;s system and if they</text>
  <text start="447.469" dur="4.23">wanted to see them they would certainly</text>
  <text start="449.269" dur="5.25">have them they would certain be able to</text>
  <text start="451.699" dur="5.22">do so in a response Clinton said she</text>
  <text start="454.519" dur="4.11">became aware of the percentage of emails</text>
  <text start="456.919" dur="2.881">that were in the state system shortly</text>
  <text start="458.629" dur="3.06">before the committee&amp;#39;s hearing a</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="3.779">calculation she said she did not perform</text>
  <text start="461.689" dur="4.56">and said she attached a copy of a letter</text>
