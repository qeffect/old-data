  <text start="55.809" dur="4.68">november second 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="58.39" dur="4.68">the episode is US government is</text>
  <text start="60.489" dur="5.91">preparing for anarchy during and after</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="5.869">the election let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.399" dur="5.76">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="7.481">now we&amp;#39;ve been talking a lot about Senta</text>
  <text start="72.159" dur="9.181">the TTIP the TPP and we know that seta</text>
  <text start="76.42" dur="9.18">well that is a Trojan horse designed to</text>
  <text start="81.34" dur="6.839">pave the way for the TTIP and we can see</text>
  <text start="85.6" dur="6.329">that Justin Trudeau Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="88.179" dur="9.23">Justin Trudeau signed the seta deal in</text>
  <text start="91.929" dur="9.901">Brussels and we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="8.49">after the elections Obama is going to</text>
  <text start="101.83" dur="8.52">try to push the TTIP the TPP through</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="6.791">he&amp;#39;s going to try to get approved and we</text>
  <text start="110.35" dur="4.68">understand that they will do whatever</text>
  <text start="112.69" dur="3.599">they have to to get this through just</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="3.41">like they did with the Affordable Care</text>
  <text start="116.289" dur="4.381">Act and every other piece of legislation</text>
  <text start="118.44" dur="5.53">but something very interesting about</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="6.92">seta is that most of the American</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="9.45">companies they have subsidiaries in</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="9.069">Canada and the current count of the</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="9">number of US companies that have this is</text>
  <text start="136.659" dur="9.211">around 42,000 now when we look at set</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="6.06">then we look at the TPP the TTIP we can</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="5.69">see that this is not going to help the</text>
  <text start="148.48" dur="8.539">job situation if we look at NAFTA NAFTA</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="9.84">did not work 800,000 jobs were lost in</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="9.101">the United States shipped overseas and</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="12.009">seta along with TTIP well we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="11.58">see jobs once again lost and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.409" dur="6.721">expecting with seta that by 2023 about</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="5.34">230 jobs will be lost</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="5.13">set two countries 200,000 of them in the</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="6.12">EU and eighty thousand more in the rest</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="7.67">of the world and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="6.65">that they&amp;#39;re not going to create jobs</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="6.49">it&amp;#39;s going to have the opposite effect</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="5.74">remember these bills that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="4.59">pushing these trade deals that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.55" dur="5.4">pushing they have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="10.62">free trade it has to do with keeping</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="10.31">control of governments making sure they</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="6.38">have the final world when I say they</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="8.65">corporations central banks the elite</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="8.19">they control the government&amp;#39;s through a</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="6.27">one-world type of government structure</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="6.07">this is why the Internet has been passed</text>
  <text start="232.18" dur="5.97">off to the UN this is why they want a</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="7.14">global currency this is why they want</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="7.55">the TTIP and set the past because this</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="6.57">will complete what they want to do and</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="5.92">we can see right now with all the</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="4.86">refugees coming into this country and we</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="3.63">have to remember why refugees are coming</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="3.72">in there&amp;#39;s many different judgment</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="4.65">agendas associated with it but one of</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="4.76">the biggest ones is to prepare the</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="5.97">United States for a third world country</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="6.33">because as we know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="5.45">happen is as the dollar is devalued</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="4.45">Americans are going to be very upset and</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="4.3">they&amp;#39;re going to say well I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="6.72">to be doing this job for this amount of</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="6.54">pay well don&amp;#39;t worry we have a refugee</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="5.25">and illegal immigrant to take your place</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="5.79">and there is going to be a transition of</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="5.93">this I mean we&amp;#39;re already seeing what</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="8.01">Obama has laid out for law enforcement</text>
  <text start="291" dur="8.77">now it sounds good on the surface where</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="6.93">he wants to push to hire minorities in</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.61">the police forces and everyone says yes</text>
  <text start="302.89" dur="8.1">we have to have diversity yes that</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="8.309">sounds great so Obama is asking the</text>
  <text start="310.99" dur="6.779">nation&amp;#39;s 18,000 law enforcement agencies</text>
  <text start="313.689" dur="8.28">to forgive drug use disregard the</text>
  <text start="317.769" dur="6.3">criminal records of candidates and lower</text>
  <text start="321.969" dur="6.78">the standards on written and physical</text>
  <text start="324.069" dur="7.82">exam it&amp;#39;s all part of his advance</text>
  <text start="328.749" dur="6.24">diversity and law enforcement initiative</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="7.471">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.989" dur="8.85">going to allow maybe illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="10.709">refugees with criminal records with drug</text>
  <text start="343.839" dur="11.97">use to become law enforcement officers</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="11.77">shouldn&amp;#39;t we have people live up to a</text>
  <text start="355.809" dur="11.73">higher expectation then lowering the</text>
  <text start="361.839" dur="10.68">expectation to bring in more people why</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="9.33">would we do this why in the world would</text>
  <text start="372.519" dur="6.66">they want to lower the requirements to</text>
  <text start="376.869" dur="5.431">become a police officer think about that</text>
  <text start="379.179" dur="7.86">for a second wouldn&amp;#39;t you say that</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="7.379">people would have to strive to hit the</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="6.39">high requirements to become a police</text>
  <text start="389.679" dur="5.13">officer imagine if we did this around</text>
  <text start="393.429" dur="4.59">the country let&amp;#39;s say you wanted to go</text>
  <text start="394.809" dur="5.88">to college well to let people into</text>
  <text start="398.019" dur="4.71">college instead of you know a thousand</text>
  <text start="400.689" dur="4.62">or 1100 on the SATs we&amp;#39;ll just use that</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="5.58">an example you only have to score four</text>
  <text start="405.309" dur="7.32">hundred and then we will allow everyone</text>
  <text start="408.309" dur="9.86">to come in well what does that do to the</text>
  <text start="412.629" dur="9.02">colleges well it lowers their rating</text>
  <text start="418.169" dur="7.66">what happens to the police officers well</text>
  <text start="421.649" dur="11.58">we&amp;#39;re going to get criminals drug users</text>
  <text start="425.829" dur="11.84">as officers of the law and in California</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="8.321">guess what they&amp;#39;re doing it right now</text>
  <text start="437.669" dur="7.51">because they&amp;#39;re going along with what</text>
  <text start="441.55" dur="4.73">Obama wants and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="445.179" dur="3.411">that</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="4.37">they don&amp;#39;t care they want these</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="5.94">individuals that they can control</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="6.7">because this is not going to be a police</text>
  <text start="454.53" dur="4.65">force that belongs to the neighborhood</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="5.16">that has families in the neighborhood</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="6.69">this is going to be a police force that</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="5.37">will do criminal activity this is going</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="4.38">to be a police force around the country</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="5.7">not just in one area that is controlled</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="5.82">by the federal government to control the</text>
  <text start="473.58" dur="5.61">people and they will do whatever they</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="5.82">need to do to control the people you can</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="7.86">see where this is going you can see what</text>
  <text start="481.89" dur="8.63">their plans are and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="7.369">we&amp;#39;re heading down a very dangerous path</text>
  <text start="490.52" dur="6.33">and at this point people should be</text>
  <text start="494.419" dur="6.401">screaming at the top of their lungs</text>
  <text start="496.85" dur="6.52">absolutely not we will not lower the</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="5.52">requirements we will not give these</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="5.519">individuals a job as a police officer if</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="5.879">they&amp;#39;re a drug user if they have</text>
  <text start="508.889" dur="5.851">criminal records and we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="512.219" dur="4.5">lower the standards to become a police</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="3.419">officer but they want anyone in if you</text>
  <text start="516.719" dur="4.95">notice they do the same thing with</text>
  <text start="518.159" dur="6.301">buying a house didn&amp;#39;t they lower the</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="5.331">requirements and they loud subprime</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="5.12">people in then they also do this with</text>
  <text start="527" dur="6.58">automobiles and what happens in the end</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="5.92">the whole thing just falls apart well</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="5.16">the same things same things going to</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="6.86">happen but they&amp;#39;re preparing us once</text>
  <text start="538.74" dur="8.28">again to be a third-world country</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="6.7">they&amp;#39;re preparing for anarchy and they</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="4.95">need certain individuals that won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="7.26">question that won&amp;#39;t think that will just</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="6.47">do and that&amp;#39;s what the US government the</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="6.6">central bankers are doing right now</text>
  <text start="558.44" dur="7.899">they&amp;#39;re taking control of the police</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="6.6">forces they&amp;#39;re taking control of the</text>
  <text start="566.339" dur="5.821">internet they&amp;#39;re taking control of the</text>
  <text start="569.52" dur="5.189">world wide currency they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="7.6">control of everything they can get their</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="7.151">hands on because they want full control</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="4.41">and they want to maintain control and</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="4.32">when they maintain control and if you</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="3.72">look in other countries that the United</text>
  <text start="586.18" dur="3.57">States has invaded and had a regime</text>
  <text start="587.89" dur="5.76">change you can see how they treat the</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="8.85">people who oppose what they are doing</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="7.53">they drone them they kill them they call</text>
  <text start="598.6" dur="5.28">them terrorists i don&amp;#39;t think i have to</text>

  <text start="603.88" dur="4.67">we understand that do dirtay he is</text>
  <text start="606.55" dur="4.47">pulling away from the united states and</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="6.31">we can see right now the united states</text>
  <text start="611.02" dur="5.79">is telling the philippines that we are</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="7.05">no longer going to sell you assault</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="7.68">rifles and we can see that Duterte says</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="6.27">the following to the United States look</text>
  <text start="624.49" dur="5.82">at these monkeys the 26,000 firearms we</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="5">wanted to buy they don&amp;#39;t want to sell it</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="6.03">to us don&amp;#39;t they realize that we have</text>
  <text start="633.18" dur="5.7">homemade guns here we can create them</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="5.34">ourselves we don&amp;#39;t need the Americans</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="5.44">now we see what the State Department is</text>
  <text start="641.68" dur="6.48">doing they&amp;#39;re putting pressure on your</text>
  <text start="644.32" dur="6.81">dirt a holding back not providing them</text>
  <text start="648.16" dur="4.23">with weapons and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="651.13" dur="4.14">United Sates government central bankers</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="6.21">they are completely against going after</text>
  <text start="655.27" dur="5.1">drug dealers going after drug producers</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="3.99">because as we know the United States</text>
  <text start="660.37" dur="5.28">government the CIA and other agencies</text>
  <text start="662.59" dur="4.26">are in this country dealing the drugs</text>

  <text start="666.85" dur="6.66">they are the biggest dealer of drugs</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="7.59">around the world and the war on drugs is</text>
  <text start="673.51" dur="6.9">a war on all the other drug distributors</text>
  <text start="677.5" dur="8.37">so the CIA and other agencies can</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="8.46">distribute narcotics out in South Sudan</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="4.77">the UN brought in about what four</text>
  <text start="688.87" dur="5.34">thousand or so peacekeeper troops</text>
  <text start="690.64" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re supposed to protect the citizens</text>
  <text start="694.21" dur="5.88">there and there was an independent</text>
  <text start="696.64" dur="5.64">investigation because the in July they</text>
  <text start="700.09" dur="6.9">were deadly clashes in South Sudan and</text>
  <text start="702.28" dur="6.42">they realized that the UN military that</text>
  <text start="706.99" dur="4.32">was supposed to supposed to be there to</text>
  <text start="708.7" dur="4.74">protect civilians well guess what they</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="4.14">didn&amp;#39;t protect anybody</text>
  <text start="713.44" dur="4.65">and we reported on this a while back</text>
  <text start="715.45" dur="4.17">where we&amp;#39;re saying that these soldiers</text>
  <text start="718.09" dur="2.82">that they are now bringing in two</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="4.17">countries they&amp;#39;re not there to protect</text>
