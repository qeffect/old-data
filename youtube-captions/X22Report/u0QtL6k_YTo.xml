  <text start="84.32" dur="5.01">financial news now our founding fathers</text>
  <text start="87.14" dur="4.86">they knew the secret of the central</text>
  <text start="89.33" dur="7.56">banking system they knew that paper</text>
  <text start="92" dur="8.579">currency eventually destroys a nation</text>
  <text start="96.89" dur="6.45">and they knew how to stop it they knew</text>
  <text start="100.579" dur="5.671">that they could never let this happen</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="7.26">because once the central bank takes</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="7.5">control they corrupt a system and of</text>
  <text start="110.6" dur="7.89">course once the system is corrupt guess</text>
  <text start="113.75" dur="10.469">what you have to go back to some type of</text>
  <text start="118.49" dur="9.84">standard a gold standard and we see from</text>
  <text start="124.219" dur="6.961">history this is why the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="6.84">created the Constitution the rights of</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="8.1">the people and created a system where</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="8.19">the people coin their own money create</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="6.51">their own currency without a private</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="5.07">western central bank this is why this is</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="5.43">the third private west central bank in</text>
  <text start="148.43" dur="6.06">the United States two others were kicked</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="4.74">out this one is about to be kicked out</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="3.18">and we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about that</text>
  <text start="155.96" dur="4.35">in just a minute but first I wanted to</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="5.67">head out to the UK because we can see</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="4.05">that the people of the UK are saying</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="4.02">listen</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="5.73">we already voted twice now on Mays deal</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="4.59">which is really the EU deal will no</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="4.23">longer vote on this deal</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="3.72">speaker John Bercow said that the</text>
  <text start="174.32" dur="3.06">government could not bring forward</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="5.13">proposals for a vote in a parliament</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="5.82">that were substantially the same as had</text>
  <text start="180.8" dur="5.37">already been defeated twice before in</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="5.34">January and last week he said this is my</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="4.92">conclusion if the government wishes to</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="4.65">bring forward a new proposition that is</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="4.71">neither the same nor substantially the</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="5.07">same as that disposed by the House on</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="5.43">the 12th of March this would be entirely</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="5.82">in order what the government cannot</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.72">legitly do is to resubmit to the House</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.19">of Commons the same proposition or</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="4.84">substantially the same proposition as</text>
  <text start="209.27" dur="4.68">that of last week which was rejected by</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="6.93">a hundred and forty nine votes this is</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="8.7">what he said we&amp;#39;ll have to see what the</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="6.24">EU does now what may does now because</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="4.41">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is listen</text>
  <text start="224.96" dur="4.77">this failed twice already</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re not looking at this deal we need</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="6.03">something different and of course</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="5.609">remember what Mae said that this is the</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="5.88">only deal this is the only deal that the</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="8.611">EU gave her and I believe they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="241.64" dur="7.83">look for a delay in the brexit and this</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="6.56">is exactly what the central banks want</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="6.48">they want the UK to stay in limbo and</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="4.63">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="5.25">but it looks like this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="4.89">headed unless all of a sudden Mae comes</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.53">up with this incredible deal or maybe</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="5.97">the people should come up with the deal</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="5.91">and pass it off to Mae and say this is</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="5.79">what we would like now here in the</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="6.57">United States we know that the central</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="6.78">bank system is deteriorating it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="6.06">collapsing Trump right now is trying to</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="6.06">bring back as many manufacturers as many</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="6.54">businesses and create as many jobs as</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="6.479">possible because as the central bank</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="6.93">system implodes on itself we need to</text>
  <text start="294.229" dur="5.611">have these plants we need to have these</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="4.59">operations we need to have these jobs in</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="5.06">place and this is a very difficult thing</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="5.03">to do because corporations right now</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="5.739">most of them are teetering on bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="6.58">they bought back a lot of stock the</text>
  <text start="310.639" dur="6.571">economy is deteriorating and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="6.509">just trying to survive and we see</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="7.23">already that General Motors they want to</text>
  <text start="320.449" dur="5.851">close their plant in Ohio and Trump is</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.84">saying no no don&amp;#39;t close the plant in</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.739">Ohio close the plant in China or Mexico</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="7">you need the plant in the United States</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="6.931">we need to bring jobs home here so close</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="6.81">those plants bring them all back and</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="7.629">we&amp;#39;ll work something out and the</text>

  <text start="791.39" dur="8.23">everyone into thinking that their system</text>
  <text start="795.51" dur="7.68">is the only system this is why back in</text>
  <text start="799.62" dur="6.089">1913 all books and everything was</text>
  <text start="803.19" dur="7.2">completely changed and they started to</text>
  <text start="805.709" dur="7.171">introduce their economic teachings to</text>
  <text start="810.39" dur="5.55">the American public teaching them that</text>
  <text start="812.88" dur="5.67">debt is good that their system is the</text>
  <text start="815.94" dur="6">only system that the Fed is very</text>

  <text start="843.92" dur="4.56">other central banks in this country and</text>
  <text start="845.84" dur="4.05">they were kicked out because people</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="3.27">realized and there were certain</text>
  <text start="849.89" dur="3.21">individuals that stood up to them and</text>
  <text start="851.75" dur="2.66">said no we&amp;#39;re not going down this path</text>
  <text start="853.1" dur="4.53">again</text>
  <text start="854.41" dur="5.89">but once again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="857.63" dur="5.28">corrupted certain individuals in 1913</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="5.61">and ever since then the corruption</text>
  <text start="862.91" dur="6.27">spread and it continued to spread across</text>
