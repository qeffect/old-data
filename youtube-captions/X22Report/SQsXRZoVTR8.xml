  <text start="58.3" dur="6.45">is episode 1357 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.99" dur="5.43">August 16th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.75" dur="5.52">episode is trade negotiations begin the</text>
  <text start="67.42" dur="4.65">elite fire back with threats let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.27" dur="4.709">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.07" dur="6.18">news now as we keep following these</text>
  <text start="74.979" dur="6.481">economic indicators we are continually</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="5.79">seeing the same exact pattern where the</text>
  <text start="81.46" dur="4.83">central bank those who manipulate the</text>
  <text start="84.04" dur="4.439">economy they&amp;#39;re continually trying to</text>
  <text start="86.29" dur="5.88">push the economy up and the economy the</text>
  <text start="88.479" dur="5.941">real economy the free economy is trying</text>
  <text start="92.17" dur="4.32">to pull it down because basically this</text>
  <text start="94.42" dur="4.17">whole economy is based on a gigantic</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="4.71">illusion and what happens</text>
  <text start="98.59" dur="6.48">in the long term is that the real</text>
  <text start="101.2" dur="6.809">economy will show itself it always has</text>
  <text start="105.07" dur="5.52">it always will and we&amp;#39;re going to see it</text>
  <text start="108.009" dur="6.39">again because people can only keep an</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="5.55">illusion alive for so long and you can</text>
  <text start="114.399" dur="4.08">look at Enron you can look at Bernie</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="4.649">Madoff you can look at many others</text>
  <text start="118.479" dur="5.221">who&amp;#39;ve tried to keep their illusion</text>
  <text start="120.789" dur="6.591">alive but what always happens there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.7" dur="6.779">someplace somehow something always</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="5.68">happens and the whole thing completely</text>
  <text start="130.479" dur="5.191">falls apart and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="4.89">that the housing market well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="3.42">starting to crumble apart not just here</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="4.02">in the United States but we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="6.3">to see it crumble apart in Canada and</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="4.849">Australia throughout Europe and here in</text>
  <text start="145.39" dur="4.89">the United States we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="6.101">since June when we had the surprise jump</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="6.929">in housing starts which are now revised</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="6.63">lower we see that well July is not that</text>
  <text start="157.209" dur="5.811">good and we&amp;#39;re seeing that permits have</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="7.159">plunged by negative 4.8% and negative</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="9.99">4.1% so we see housing starts and</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="10.441">permits they have plunged now once again</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="6.43">we can see that as they push it up</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="3.22">everything is being dragged back down</text>
  <text start="179.44" dur="3.27">now</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.85">remember how do they keep this illusion</text>
  <text start="182.71" dur="4.86">alive well we&amp;#39;re very close to zero</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="3.96">sent interest rates they&amp;#39;re allowing</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="6.33">individuals to come in and put in put</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="7.08">down less than 10% we&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="6.21">subprime individuals and there are</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="5.37">investment companies hedge funds who</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="5.4">have been purchasing homes where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="4.86">able to buy thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="6.48">them keep them off the market and drive</text>
  <text start="207.49" dur="7.5">prices up banks are told not to go ahead</text>
  <text start="211.99" dur="5.49">and foreclose on homes let people live</text>
  <text start="214.99" dur="4.68">there maintain the homes and make sure</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="5.22">they stay off the market this is how</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="5.61">now the majority of the plunge that</text>
  <text start="225.58" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re seeing has come from multifamily</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="4.53">stars they&amp;#39;ve crashed by thirty five</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="6.05">point two percent year-on-year this is</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="6.57">the lowest since September of 2016 and</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="6.19">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="5.4">housing market it is really gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="4.5">actually what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="244.81" dur="4.53">housing starts they are continually</text>
  <text start="247" dur="5.489">declining and we&amp;#39;re getting to that</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="7.56">point where we&amp;#39;re dropping below that</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="7.56">point of where we were prior to the</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="6.15">crash of 2008 and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="260.049" dur="5.911">time that this is really not a good sign</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="5.16">and this is just one of the indicators</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ve seen many many other indicators</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="5.61">which show us that this economy is</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="4.95">completely and utterly falling apart now</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="4.349">the Fed is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="4.62">continually telling us that they really</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="4.651">want to get inflation up it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="5.029">so low right now and they can&amp;#39;t figure</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="6.39">out how they can push inflation up and</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="7.031">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that savvy</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="6.18">investors they know that the US dollar</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.64">loses value every year this is really</text>
  <text start="295.39" dur="5.279">not a surprise the CEO of JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="5.91">Jamie Dimon characterized this</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="6.121">eloquently with an analogy of musical</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="6.48">chairs basically that at some point some</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="6">asset class has to blow up and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.54" dur="6.33">an actual reason for this because in a</text>
  <text start="312.79" dur="7.2">debt-based Fayette monetary system fresh</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="5.67">credit needs to be created on a gong</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.95">going basis even to pay back the</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="5.7">interest on previous credit or the</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="6.06">system will just implode now the Fed</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="5.97">gnosis bankers know that CEOs know this</text>
  <text start="331" dur="6.15">a communists know this but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="7.38">come out there they tell everyone this</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="8.25">remains a secret and they keep it very</text>
  <text start="341.59" dur="7.26">very quiet they don&amp;#39;t want the average</text>
  <text start="345.4" dur="7.32">retail investing public to know about</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="9.12">this so right now inflation is much</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="8.85">worse than the Fed is saying and if the</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="7.8">Fed says inflation is 2% then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="7.44">official inflation is 2% who is anyone</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.43">to question the Fed does anyone say hey</text>
  <text start="369.01" dur="3.24">Fed you&amp;#39;re wrong no the corporate media</text>
  <text start="371.2" dur="2.97">goes along with it</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="5.85">the majority of the public believes it</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="6.15">well it&amp;#39;s 2% even though I see prices of</text>
  <text start="378.1" dur="4.32">meat going up even though I see prices</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="6.54">of eggs going up even though I see the</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="7.41">price of milk going up even if the cost</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="5.85">of tuition is going up housing prices</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="8.73">are going up the stock market is going</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="8.82">up car prices are going up but if the</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="4.64">Fed says that inflation is 2% well</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="5.98">so regulators don&amp;#39;t want investors to</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.05">suspect that inflation is greater than</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="6.26">what the Fed is saying this allows them</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="7.65">to continue their QE program in stealth</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="5.17">now in reality for most people and</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="4.68">especially those individuals that have</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="5.55">retired inflation is killing their</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="6.09">quality of life and the everyday family</text>
  <text start="426.16" dur="5.46">well inflation is killing their quality</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="3.75">of life and I forgot to mention we see</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="5.88">inflation in automobile insurance</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="5.94">inflation in health insurance so these</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="3.24">are payments that you make every single</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="3.09">month not like oh I want to go out and</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="4.77">buy a banana maybe this month I&amp;#39;ll skip</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="5.43">well insurance especially auto insurance</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="5.43">is mandatory well actually so is health</text>
  <text start="447.73" dur="5.1">insurance you get the penalty but that</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="4.55">is continually moving up</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="7.41">and up and up and higher and higher and</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="8.08">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="6.66">want to keep this part a secret because</text>
  <text start="463.57" dur="6.54">remember wage inflation that&amp;#39;s stagnant</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="8.73">actually it&amp;#39;s falling but product</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="7.62">inflation is moving up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="6.06">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="477.73" dur="6.9">keep this illusion alive even though in</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="4.23">even even with inflation continually</text>
  <text start="484.63" dur="3.33">moving up because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="7.23">convince everyone that this is not</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="7.8">happening now what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="5.55">right now they&amp;#39;re working with their</text>
  <text start="495.76" dur="5.49">member banks and these member banks I</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="5.13">have a profit incentive when it comes to</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="4.83">inflation you see if the banks can rip</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="5.52">people off on a small money transfer to</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="5.61">foreign countries meanwhile borrowing at</text>
  <text start="509.35" dur="4.53">rock-bottom rates and inflating market</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="6.87">like real estate stocks and the rest it</text>
  <text start="513.88" dur="7.17">will create a new oligarch class it will</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="5.04">make certain individuals very very</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="4.89">wealthy and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="523.6" dur="4.59">seeing we&amp;#39;ve been seeing inequality</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="4.49">where the wealthy become very very</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.16">wealthy the middle class is disappearing</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="5.5">the poor are getting poorer the middle</text>
  <text start="533.35" dur="8.28">class is moving into the poor category</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="7.86">and this is getting worse and again what</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="7.31">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re keeping this</text>
  <text start="543.79" dur="8.16">alive through this gigantic illusion and</text>
  <text start="548.94" dur="4.6">once again if the US government comes</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="3.33">out and the Fed comes out and says the</text>
  <text start="553.54" dur="3.03">economy&amp;#39;s doing well and the corporate</text>
  <text start="555.28" dur="3.36">media is out there saying the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="4.62">doing well and telling everyone to look</text>
  <text start="558.64" dur="5.79">at the stock market everyone believes</text>
  <text start="561.19" dur="8.01">that this is what&amp;#39;s happening even</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="8.28">though we have 8,000 retail stores</text>
  <text start="569.2" dur="7.91">closing tens of thousand people losing</text>
  <text start="572.71" dur="7.22">their jobs less traffic into restaurants</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="7.48">chain restaurants are in trouble</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="6.58">automobile sales are declining the</text>
  <text start="584.59" dur="3.81">subprime industry when</text>
  <text start="586.51" dur="3.99">they have no one left to give these</text>
  <text start="588.4" dur="4.98">loans out to so that&amp;#39;s reeling right now</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="6.39">delinquencies are on the rise and tax</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="8.31">receipts for federal and state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.89" dur="6.3">falling but if they tell you that the</text>
  <text start="601.69" dur="4.38">economy is doing well then you must</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="5.73">believe and again it&amp;#39;s one gigantic</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="5.75">illusion now the Fed came out and it</text>
  <text start="608.92" dur="6.87">looks like they&amp;#39;ve basically gave us a</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="6.1">subtle warning that the debt bubble is</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="3.45">beginning to burst now of course I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="4.17">going to come out and tell you hey</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="5.73">everybody the debt bubble has just</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="5.43">popped they do give you little bread</text>
  <text start="624.97" dur="4.77">crumbs to let you know what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="627.52" dur="3.84">happening and most of the time whatever</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re telling you is it is the</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="4.68">opposite I mean if you go back to 2008</text>
  <text start="633.46" dur="5.63">you know the subprime is contained we</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="5.46">know it wasn&amp;#39;t we know that housing does</text>
  <text start="639.09" dur="6.82">fall in price I mean</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="7.71">houses will decline in price they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="4.89">forecasting a recession well we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="3.66">recession in the same year they said</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="3.66">this the same thing with Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="3.6">where we&amp;#39;re not going to see any type of</text>
  <text start="654.46" dur="4.31">financial crisis you know in a lifetime</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="6.87">we know this is going to be the opposite</text>
  <text start="658.77" dur="7.06">so the New York Fed has said that the</text>
  <text start="663.34" dur="4.65">u.s. the average u.s. household has hit</text>
  <text start="665.83" dur="5.72">a new record for debt surpassing the old</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="7.98">record set at the peak of 2007 bubble</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="11.05">put simply the average u.s. household</text>
  <text start="675.97" dur="12.12">today is more in debt than back in 2007</text>
  <text start="682.6" dur="9.65">going into 2008 so we&amp;#39;ve passed the peak</text>
  <text start="688.09" dur="6.72">of the massive debt bubble in late 2007</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="5.71">so think about what they just told us</text>
  <text start="694.81" dur="6.57">they just told us and they revealed in</text>
  <text start="697.96" dur="6.36">not so many words that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="701.38" dur="4.4">massive debt bubble but this is only</text>
  <text start="704.32" dur="4.95">half the story</text>
  <text start="705.78" dur="6.28">there&amp;#39;s another issue so what is the</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="6.87">other issue well the New York Fed noted</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="7.17">that there is a serious delinquency</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="3.99">problem in regards to credit cards and</text>
  <text start="719.23" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s on the rise</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="3.96">now this is not a new development we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="5.69">been discussing this it&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="724.09" dur="7.29">for nine straight months and this trend</text>
  <text start="727.86" dur="8.71">has not been seen since the depth of the</text>
  <text start="731.38" dur="6.9">great crisis in 2009 so US households a</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="4.98">more in debt than they weren&amp;#39;t in late</text>
  <text start="738.28" dur="5.67">2007 the credit cycle is turning with</text>
  <text start="741.55" dur="5.57">delinquencies rising just as they did in</text>
  <text start="743.95" dur="6.26">the great crisis of 2008 meanwhile</text>
  <text start="747.12" dur="7.41">stocks are at an all-time high</text>
  <text start="750.21" dur="7.9">just like in 2008 they were hitting the</text>
  <text start="754.53" dur="6.25">14,000 range at that point so what</text>
  <text start="758.11" dur="4.38">happens when the markets wake up to the</text>
  <text start="760.78" dur="4.38">fact that yet another massive debt</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="6.93">bubble is beginning to burst I mean</text>
  <text start="765.16" dur="6.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="5.61">happening all over again</text>
  <text start="771.96" dur="5.02">but everyone is looking elsewhere</text>
  <text start="775.03" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;re not looking at what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="776.98" dur="10.59">going on now we can see that Trump he is</text>
  <text start="782.89" dur="5.88">starting the NAFTA negotiations it would</text>
  <text start="787.57" dur="3.27">have been better if he just got rid of</text>
  <text start="788.77" dur="5.19">them but there were certain individuals</text>
  <text start="790.84" dur="4.71">the big Club of corporations who said</text>
  <text start="793.96" dur="4.26">you just can&amp;#39;t get rid of it you need to</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="5.34">negotiate it and I think as these</text>
  <text start="798.22" dur="5.76">negotiations go on we might even see the</text>
  <text start="800.89" dur="5.22">end of NAFTA but John McCain is out</text>
  <text start="803.98" dur="3.78">there and remember a lot of these elite</text>
  <text start="806.11" dur="4.47">these people who have made a lot of</text>
  <text start="807.76" dur="5.97">money off of these trade deals they</text>
  <text start="810.58" dur="7.14">don&amp;#39;t want them to go away and it is</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="8.04">cost America many many hundreds of</text>
  <text start="817.72" dur="7.05">thousands of jobs these trade deals were</text>
  <text start="821.77" dur="4.41">never put into place to benefit the</text>
  <text start="824.77" dur="3.57">everyday person</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="5.37">the latest trade deal which was</text>
  <text start="828.34" dur="6.78">completely canceled the TPP that was not</text>
  <text start="831.55" dur="5.7">going to help America it wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="7.61">help the everyday person the everyday</text>
  <text start="837.25" dur="9.9">factory worker it was going to bring in</text>
  <text start="842.73" dur="5.52">other workers from other countries and</text>
  <text start="847.15" dur="4.82">we</text>
  <text start="848.25" dur="5.73">to pay them the salary that they were</text>
  <text start="851.97" dur="4.83">making in their country here in the</text>
  <text start="853.98" dur="4.91">United States and the American worker</text>
  <text start="856.8" dur="4.59">would not be able to compete with them</text>
  <text start="858.89" dur="3.55">this is why this trade deal was</text>
  <text start="861.39" dur="3.39">cancelled I mean there&amp;#39;s many other</text>
  <text start="862.44" dur="5.21">reasons that they were going to place a</text>
  <text start="864.78" dur="4.83">court which set up which sat above</text>
  <text start="867.65" dur="4.06">governments so they can control</text>
  <text start="869.61" dur="3.65">governments they were they were going to</text>
  <text start="871.71" dur="3.84">actually take the sovereignty away from</text>
  <text start="873.26" dur="5.08">each and every one of the countries this</text>
  <text start="875.55" dur="5.73">was the process of creating a one-world</text>
  <text start="878.34" dur="5.58">government but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="881.28" dur="6.96">McCain he is calling on the</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="7.02">administration to preserve the North</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="4.89">American Free Trade Agreement saying</text>
  <text start="890.94" dur="5.16">that if he does this it&amp;#39;s going to hurt</text>
  <text start="893.13" dur="4.41">a lot of people in his district and</text>
  <text start="896.1" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of senators</text>
  <text start="897.54" dur="5.7">those individuals that are within the</text>
  <text start="901.2" dur="5.58">elite they&amp;#39;re going to say the same</text>
  <text start="903.24" dur="7.41">exact thing because remember these bills</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="6.39">these laws that they push through this</text>
  <text start="910.65" dur="6.63">is all to benefit and line their pockets</text>
  <text start="913.17" dur="6.57">with cash it&amp;#39;s not to benefit the people</text>
  <text start="917.28" dur="4.77">just like Obamacare just like all the</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="4.92">other agreements this was never to help</text>
  <text start="922.05" dur="5.13">the everyday person and this is what</text>
  <text start="924.66" dur="7.38">this is all about we want a government</text>
  <text start="927.18" dur="8.04">we want those in government to work for</text>
  <text start="932.04" dur="4.44">the people not to make them wealthy not</text>
  <text start="935.22" dur="4.16">to make deals</text>
  <text start="936.48" dur="8.52">so they benefit we want these</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="8.2">individuals to work for yes us we the</text>
  <text start="945" dur="5.04">people that&amp;#39;s why they are there and we</text>
  <text start="947.58" dur="6.78">can see that most of these individuals</text>
  <text start="950.04" dur="6.09">well they&amp;#39;re not doing it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="954.36" dur="4.31">working for the people they might say</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="6.36">they are I mean they&amp;#39;re very good at</text>
  <text start="958.67" dur="5.95">speaking I mean its political talk but</text>
  <text start="962.49" dur="2.64">their actions show something completely</text>
  <text start="964.62" dur="2.49">different</text>
  <text start="965.13" dur="4.14">because if they were truly working for</text>
  <text start="967.11" dur="5.55">the people and they really wanted to</text>
  <text start="969.27" dur="5.25">benefit the American people everything</text>
  <text start="972.66" dur="4.35">that they put into place they would have</text>
  <text start="974.52" dur="4.23">taken on themselves like for example</text>
  <text start="977.01" dur="3.75">they would have exempted themselves from</text>
  <text start="978.75" dur="3.39">Obamacare they would have said listen we</text>
  <text start="980.76" dur="3.48">are just like you we are the</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="3.99">people we&amp;#39;re going to take this health</text>
  <text start="984.24" dur="4.38">insurance we&amp;#39;re going to drop what we</text>
  <text start="986.13" dur="6.45">have because this new insurance is so</text>
  <text start="988.62" dur="6.72">great but again this didn&amp;#39;t happen so</text>
  <text start="992.58" dur="5.85">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="6.57">elite they&amp;#39;re already starting with the</text>
  <text start="998.43" dur="7.32">threats because they don&amp;#39;t want what</text>
  <text start="1001.91" dur="6.87">they have to be taken away and this is</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="5.22">the beginning stages of dismantling what</text>
  <text start="1008.78" dur="4.08">the elite the deep state the neocons the</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="5.6">central bank has put into place over</text>
  <text start="1012.86" dur="7.14">time and again this is going to take</text>
  <text start="1016.57" dur="4.99">some time to unravel everything because</text>
  <text start="1020" dur="2.76">they made it very very difficult because</text>
  <text start="1021.56" dur="3.3">you have to go through Congress and</text>
  <text start="1022.76" dur="3.949">they&amp;#39;ve done this on purpose to make</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="4.589">sure that you just can&amp;#39;t unwind it and</text>
  <text start="1026.709" dur="5.5">this is exactly what is happening right</text>
  <text start="1029.449" dur="4.531">now and will it be able to will</text>
  <text start="1032.209" dur="3.99">everything be able to be dismantled</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="4.26">before the economy comes down I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1036.199" dur="6.181">think so I think the economy right now</text>
  <text start="1038.24" dur="5.91">is disintegrating very very quickly more</text>
  <text start="1042.38" dur="4.17">and more individuals and we can see from</text>
  <text start="1044.15" dur="4.56">retail we can see from housing we can</text>
  <text start="1046.55" dur="3.9">see from the tax revenue I mean all</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="3.96">these things you really can&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="1050.45" dur="4.38">the revenue and sales of corporations</text>
  <text start="1052.67" dur="5.31">you can&amp;#39;t manipulate it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="1054.83" dur="5.76">apart yes you can keep the illusion</text>

  <text start="1064.04" dur="5.82">happens it all comes to an end you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1066.8" dur="5.49">fake it anymore and we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
