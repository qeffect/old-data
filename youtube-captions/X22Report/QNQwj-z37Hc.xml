  <text start="62.8" dur="6.78">one thing has changed the deep state</text>
  <text start="65.229" dur="6.631">moved up its timetable let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="69.58" dur="6.06">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="71.86" dur="6.21">geopolitical news now we see out in</text>
  <text start="75.64" dur="4.53">North Korea the situation is really</text>
  <text start="78.07" dur="3.39">heating up because we know the United</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="2.55">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="81.46" dur="3.719">they&amp;#39;ve been planning on bringing in the</text>
  <text start="82.72" dur="4.289">Fed missile system into the region of</text>
  <text start="85.179" dur="4.14">South Korea and we know the land swap</text>
  <text start="87.009" dur="5.461">deal went through now Russia and China</text>
  <text start="89.319" dur="6.211">are out there and they have repeatedly</text>
  <text start="92.47" dur="5.39">urged Seoul and Washington to reconsider</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="4.979">the missile defense system deployment</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.72">now there was a meeting between the</text>
  <text start="100.509" dur="3.571">Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and the</text>
  <text start="102.58" dur="4.77">Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="5.969">Affairs the two sides reiterated their</text>
  <text start="107.35" dur="5.01">grave concern and strong objection to</text>
  <text start="110.049" dur="4.981">the THAAD deployment and called on the</text>
  <text start="112.36" dur="4.35">u.s. and South Korea to respect China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="4.409">and Russia&amp;#39;s reasonable and fair</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="4.56">concerns over security and not to</text>
  <text start="119.439" dur="5.67">threaten the strategic balance in the</text>
  <text start="121.27" dur="7.29">region now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="125.109" dur="7.111">that this sad missile system is not just</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="8.07">for North Korea it is for China it is</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="7.53">for Russia and when it&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="6">is that the Chinese are saying listen</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="5.75">the that issue it could result in a</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.24">boycott by Chinese consumers of</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="4.75">everything Korean including the refusal</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="4.32">to choose the country as a tourist</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="3.959">destination or to buy goods made in</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="3.96">South Korea</text>
  <text start="154.209" dur="5.851">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the Chinese they</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="5.1">could stop buying South Korea South</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="5.73">Koreans from consumer goods such as cars</text>
  <text start="162.25" dur="6.269">or mobile phones and this would have a</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="6.449">devastating effect on the South Korean</text>
  <text start="168.519" dur="7.081">economy and we can see already that this</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="7.321">is turning into an economic war which</text>
  <text start="175.6" dur="6.3">will then lead to a real war now of</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="3.57">course this is what the neocons the deep</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="4.35">State the central</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="6.24">this is what they want they want to push</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="7.05">these countries into doing these things</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="8.07">and this has been their plan for quite a</text>
  <text start="193.3" dur="5.34">while now out in the Middle East we can</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="4.83">see the corporate media they are</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="6.18">spinning everything completely and we</text>
  <text start="202.27" dur="4.68">know that the Battle of misil is going</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="3.78">on and of course they&amp;#39;re making it seem</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="4.2">like everything is fantastic there the</text>
  <text start="208.6" dur="5.46">u.s. is bombing so perfectly that</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="5.31">nobody&amp;#39;s getting hit and things are</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="5.16">fantastic on the other hand when we hear</text>
  <text start="216.46" dur="6.06">things where Russia and the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="6">Forces are bombing Aleppo or Palmyra</text>
  <text start="222.52" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re killing millions or hundreds a</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="5.43">hundreds and hundreds of civilians and</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="5.55">when you look at these articles like the</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="5.04">one from the BBC that says muscle</text>
  <text start="232.99" dur="4.92">assault Iraq troops make headway against</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="5.4">the Islamic state well they make it seem</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="6.42">like everything is fine that the siege</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="5.46">into muscle is going exactly as planned</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="4.59">and nobody&amp;#39;s getting hurt when you</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="3.48">compared the same type of article about</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="3.87">Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="5.28">almost every paragraph says that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="5.85">killing civilians but when you look at</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="6">the bottom of the article that has to do</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="5.88">with missile and you see the truth</text>
  <text start="261.31" dur="6.24">it says the UN said in late January that</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="8.34">almost half of all the casualties in</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="8.94">muscle were civilians at least 1096 have</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="5.73">been killed and 694 injured across the</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="4.86">entire province since the start of</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="6">October which shows there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="281.35" dur="5.85">civilians dying so when you hear reports</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="4.86">out there telling us that Russia is</text>
  <text start="287.2" dur="4.91">bombing they&amp;#39;re hitting civilians well</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="7.43">the US is doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="8.5">again this is war we all get it but the</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="5.92">United States bombs and missiles well</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="5.25">guess what they hit civilians too and a</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="5.69">lot of them so this is not just</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="5.28">one-sided it&amp;#39;s happening on both sides</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="4.87">but what I&amp;#39;m trying to get at is that</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="4.5">the corporate media paints a picture</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="3.329">that it&amp;#39;s holding only happening to one</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="2.699">side</text>
  <text start="316.689" dur="4.76">and they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="318.339" dur="6.39">Russia is evil they&amp;#39;re killing civilians</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="4.45">Assad is evil - killing civilians the</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="2.52">United States is having a seizure</text>
  <text start="325.899" dur="4.17">missile and everything&amp;#39;s going perfectly</text>
  <text start="327.249" dur="5.01">nobody&amp;#39;s hurt except the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="4.95">of course and as we know they&amp;#39;re lifting</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="6.38">them out of the region and bringing them</text>
  <text start="335.019" dur="7.41">to different areas now it looks like</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="5.74">Russia is preparing for trump the</text>
  <text start="342.429" dur="3.96">Russian Foreign Ministry they are</text>
  <text start="344.379" dur="5.46">preparing for a previously agreed</text>
  <text start="346.389" dur="5.7">meeting between Putin and Trump and this</text>
  <text start="349.839" dur="3.42">is no secret that the agreement was</text>
  <text start="352.089" dur="3.87">reached during their telephone</text>
  <text start="353.259" dur="5.64">conversation and we&amp;#39;ll have to see when</text>
  <text start="355.959" dur="4.591">they set the date and when when the</text>
  <text start="358.899" dur="3.75">meeting will actually take place now</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="3.929">hopefully this will come a lot of the</text>
  <text start="362.649" dur="3.6">things down but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="364.479" dur="4.59">see and it was as we know the deep State</text>
  <text start="366.249" dur="5.25">the neocons the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="369.069" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t want things to calm down they want</text>
  <text start="371.499" dur="5.52">a war any way they possibly can get it</text>
  <text start="373.869" dur="5.16">and that&amp;#39;s what they want we see that</text>
  <text start="377.019" dur="6.66">Russia and China while they vetoed that</text>
  <text start="379.029" dur="7.081">draft from the US UK and from the rest</text>
  <text start="383.679" dur="4.11">of the coalition countries where they</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="3.959">were going to play sanctions on 11</text>
  <text start="387.789" dur="4.47">Syrian military commanders along with</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="4.5">banning the supply of helicopters to its</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="4.44">government and of course this was all</text>
  <text start="394.569" dur="3.27">based on fabricated charges of chemical</text>
  <text start="396.699" dur="3.78">weapons this is what they were going</text>
  <text start="397.839" dur="3.57">with and China and Russia said</text>
  <text start="400.479" dur="3.06">absolutely not</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="4.35">now countries that were supporting the</text>
  <text start="403.539" dur="4.65">resolutions included America Britain</text>
  <text start="405.759" dur="5.28">France Italy Japan Senegal Sweden</text>
  <text start="408.189" dur="4.98">Ukraine and why Russia China Bolivia</text>
  <text start="411.039" dur="4.65">completely opposed it Egypt Ethiopia</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="5.58">Ethiopia they abstained</text>
  <text start="415.689" dur="5.01">now neocon US envoy nikki Haley lied</text>
  <text start="418.749" dur="4.26">because she accused the son of using</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="5.34">chemical weapons despite no evidence</text>
  <text start="423.009" dur="4.92">proving it none exists they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.039" dur="4.59">produce it and then she went ahead and</text>
  <text start="427.929" dur="5.61">blasted Russia and China disgracefully</text>
  <text start="430.629" dur="5.58">saying they will cover the backs of</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="5.97">their friends who use chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="436.209" dur="6.54">to kill their own people why again would</text>
  <text start="439.509" dur="5.76">Assad kill his own people they are</text>
  <text start="442.749" dur="3.81">supporting him they elected him and</text>
  <text start="445.269" dur="3.66">makes no sense for him to turn around</text>
  <text start="446.559" dur="4.561">and start killing them he has enough</text>
  <text start="448.929" dur="6.191">problems with the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="6.299">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that the</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="6.21">Syrian government and the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="457.419" dur="7.691">they have captured Palmyra Citadel from</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="5.519">the Islamic state now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="5.79">reported on the moderate rebels how they</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="6.931">have information and proof that Syria</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="4.44">gave Palmyra to the Islamic state well</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="3.539">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous because they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="4.919">it back now why would they even do this</text>
  <text start="477.319" dur="4.44">this whole thing makes no sense why</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="3.481">would they keep doing the same battle</text>
  <text start="481.759" dur="4.141">over and over I mean all these different</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="4.23">stories makes no sense when you hear the</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="3.72">other side but of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="487.97" dur="4.949">corporate media is out there and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="5.4">only hearing one side but when you hear</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="4.53">that no they&amp;#39;re taking it back they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="4.619">kicking and and kicking the Islamic</text>
  <text start="497.449" dur="4.081">state out the Russian forces are coming</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="4.08">in and they&amp;#39;re making huge headway to</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="4.949">take Palmyra back now if we remember</text>
  <text start="503.719" dur="5.521">back it was the United States that was</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="5.22">bombing in this area of Palmyra which</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="5.969">allowed the Islamic state to move back</text>
  <text start="511.699" dur="6.601">into there now we see something very</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="5.19">strange going on in northern Syria now</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="5.549">we know that Turkey wants more of the</text>
  <text start="520.399" dur="6.5">area and we see the United States they</text>
  <text start="523.849" dur="6.781">are setting up a base and man Beach and</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="6.19">what is happening right now is that it</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="5.37">looks like they&amp;#39;re preparing for some</text>
  <text start="533.089" dur="5.671">type of safe zones now is this in</text>
  <text start="536" dur="5.31">coordination with Russia and Syria not</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="5.43">really and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="5.55">General Joseph hotel he is out there</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="5.16">saying that yes we&amp;#39;re looking at safe</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="5.4">zones in Syria and he&amp;#39;s saying that it</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="5.67">would work once we bring in the ground</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="5.49">troops and other resources are in place</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="5.3">and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="6.27">right now is they&amp;#39;re setting it up and</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="4.93">preparing for these safe zones and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="4.98">saying that this would be a viable</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="6.06">concept now remember back to the think</text>
  <text start="569" dur="4.2">tank where their whole entire plan was</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="3.75">to set up these safe zones these no-fly</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="4.71">zones now the Islamic state they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.06" dur="4.889">have jet fighters so why they need a</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="4.26">no-fly zone makes no sense the only</text>
  <text start="579.949" dur="4.681">sense it makes is that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="4.44">ground and get rid of</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="4.86">all the fighters from the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="4.2">Forces and we can see right now that we</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know for sure that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="4.05">coordinating with Russia and Syria on</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="4.59">these safe zones because Russia did say</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="5.04">for these safe zones to work the Syrian</text>
  <text start="597.65" dur="4.77">Armed Forces they would need to control</text>
  <text start="599.9" dur="5.27">the areas not the US with all their</text>
  <text start="602.42" dur="5.19">ground troops and again we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="4.51">what other resources they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="5.46">about we don&amp;#39;t know how many ground</text>
  <text start="609.68" dur="4.92">troops and most likely if this is not</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="4.74">coordinated with Russia and Syria this</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="4.83">could be a complete disaster now we know</text>
  <text start="617.81" dur="3.99">the deep state the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="4.89">neocons they&amp;#39;ve been planning this for</text>
  <text start="621.8" dur="6.24">quite a while they want to get rid of</text>
  <text start="624.32" dur="6.15">Assad they have not stopped with trying</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="5.22">to reach their goal now they might be</text>
  <text start="630.47" dur="4.86">telling Trump one thing but we know they</text>
  <text start="633.26" dur="4.26">support the Islamic state they support</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="4.35">al Qaeda they support al-nusra they</text>
  <text start="637.52" dur="4.02">support al sham they support the</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="4.11">moderate rebels we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="4.38">stopped funding the moderate rebels they</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="3.54">told you told CIA stopped the funding</text>
  <text start="645.92" dur="4.68">but we can see there&amp;#39;s other back</text>
  <text start="647.33" dur="6">channels of covert money coming into the</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="4.14">system it&amp;#39;s not just one area where it</text>
  <text start="653.33" dur="4.08">comes in and that&amp;#39;s from the government</text>
  <text start="654.74" dur="4.98">they have it coming in from other dark</text>
  <text start="657.41" dur="4.83">places where they bring this money in</text>
  <text start="659.72" dur="5.61">from the opie from the poppy fields in</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="6.44">Afghans and in Afghanistan where they</text>
  <text start="665.33" dur="5.91">sell opium around the world drug money</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="4.12">which they can bring in yeah I mean it</text>
  <text start="671.24" dur="4.08">was much easier when they were stealing</text>
  <text start="672.8" dur="6.03">the oil from Syria and using that but</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="5.37">that is drying up right now but we can</text>
  <text start="678.83" dur="4.14">see that they&amp;#39;re not going to stop</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="5.79">trying to reach their goal now we see</text>

  <text start="693.59" dur="4.56">sleet is moving into the region now we</text>
  <text start="695.99" dur="3.87">have other ships there and we can see</text>
  <text start="698.15" dur="3.57">that something is being planned now we</text>
  <text start="699.86" dur="2.88">know that trump wants to get the Islamic</text>
  <text start="701.72" dur="3.24">state he wants to fight the Islamic</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="5.07">state but the only way to do this is</text>
  <text start="704.96" dur="4.53">with the serene government and Russia</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="3.6">remember the United States is in Syria</text>
  <text start="709.49" dur="4.32">illegally the United States government</text>
  <text start="711.41" dur="5.4">central bankers invaded Syria they were</text>
  <text start="713.81" dur="4.41">not invited like Russia completely</text>
  <text start="716.81" dur="3.48">different and</text>
  <text start="718.22" dur="5.1">the only way to really remove terrorism</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="6.96">in this country is to coordinate so far</text>
  <text start="723.32" dur="6.66">we have not seen this now these generals</text>
  <text start="727.25" dur="4.86">and these other individuals CIA might be</text>
  <text start="729.98" dur="4.53">telling Trump one thing and they might</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="8.34">be doing another all at the same time</text>
  <text start="734.51" dur="7.29">and we know that their entire plan well</text>
  <text start="740.45" dur="3.66">nothing&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="741.8" dur="6.05">the only thing that changed is their</text>
  <text start="744.11" dur="6.05">timetable now it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="4.48">basically looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="4.03">seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing where we are with</text>
  <text start="752.33" dur="4.8">the economy seeing how they can get the</text>
  <text start="754.19" dur="5.37">war started and all their plans that</text>
  <text start="757.13" dur="6.12">they had before well they&amp;#39;re still in</text>
  <text start="759.56" dur="6.18">the works they haven&amp;#39;t stopped and just</text>
  <text start="763.25" dur="5.07">because Trump is president doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="765.74" dur="4.92">things aren&amp;#39;t happening in the</text>
  <text start="768.32" dur="5.52">background remember he does not really</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="6.3">run the country he&amp;#39;s not really in</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="6.51">charge right now yes he can do a lot of</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="6.32">the surface stuff yes he can create</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="6.48">executive orders he can repeal Obamacare</text>
  <text start="783.28" dur="5.95">but while the corporate media is keeping</text>
  <text start="786.83" dur="4.59">everyone mesmerised by their fake news</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="4.38">and telling everyone what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="791.42" dur="4.59">what executive orders are being leaked</text>
  <text start="793.61" dur="6.12">out other things are happening in the</text>
  <text start="796.01" dur="5.82">background and the deep State the</text>
  <text start="799.73" dur="5.94">central bankers the neocons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="7.35">preparing for certain events they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="6.3">preparing for what is coming and we</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="3.87">talked about this in the past nothing</text>
  <text start="811.97" dur="3.51">has changed</text>
  <text start="813.05" dur="5.84">they are still going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="815.48" dur="6.36">system either through a cyberattack</text>
  <text start="818.89" dur="5.77">through a war however they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="821.84" dur="4.65">do it their plans are still set they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.66" dur="5.4">still going to hit the power</text>
  <text start="826.49" dur="6.75">infrastructure to cause this great event</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="4.92">and of course what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="5.16">is most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna blame it on</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="6.81">Trump somehow someway because he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="838.4" dur="5.97">perfect scapegoat at this time and we</text>
  <text start="841.79" dur="5.31">have to remember when the grid goes down</text>
  <text start="844.37" dur="5.88">and I do believe back in 2003 when they</text>
  <text start="847.1" dur="5.01">brought the eastern coast down this was</text>
  <text start="850.25" dur="4.47">a test to see if they could do it</text>
  <text start="852.11" dur="6">out in California where the power went</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="6.15">down and there was some type of incident</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="7.14">out in the Paragard there these are all</text>
  <text start="860.87" dur="7.14">examples of them preparing and testing</text>
  <text start="865.25" dur="4.26">and seeing how this is going to work now</text>
  <text start="868.01" dur="4.11">remember they&amp;#39;re not going to bring down</text>
  <text start="869.51" dur="3.69">the entire country all at once that</text>
  <text start="872.12" dur="2.94">would be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="873.2" dur="3.509">no one would hear the news what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.06" dur="4.74">going to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna bring down</text>
  <text start="876.709" dur="5.041">pockets of certain areas and when the</text>
  <text start="879.8" dur="5.34">power goes out you Snead to prepared</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="4.5">when the bank holiday happens you need</text>
  <text start="885.14" dur="3.06">to be prepared</text>
  <text start="886.25" dur="4.29">everyone thinks at this point that</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="5.16">everything&amp;#39;s all better everything is</text>
  <text start="890.54" dur="5.22">fine Trump is president president he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.36" dur="5.9">gonna make everything okay this is</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="7.259">furthest from the truth the economy is</text>
  <text start="899.26" dur="6.49">not better the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="903.019" dur="4.861">bankers they&amp;#39;re still in charge they</text>
  <text start="905.75" dur="4.62">understand the system cannot be</text>
  <text start="907.88" dur="5.91">sustained they&amp;#39;ve been pushing for a war</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="5.029">for many years moving in military assets</text>
  <text start="913.79" dur="5.76">preparing and getting ready</text>
  <text start="915.399" dur="7.06">they understand they&amp;#39;ll need an event to</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="5.01">push this forward and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="922.459" dur="4.5">ready to do this and remember when the</text>
  <text start="924.56" dur="5.13">power goes down and when the banking</text>
  <text start="926.959" dur="6.481">system is cyber attacked and when they</text>
  <text start="929.69" dur="6.48">declare bank holidays commerce will</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="6.32">cease it&amp;#39;s going to cease anyhow because</text>
  <text start="936.17" dur="7.77">the credit market is going to freeze up</text>
  <text start="939.76" dur="6.819">why not time this with an event to blame</text>
  <text start="943.94" dur="6.389">it on another country this is what</text>
  <text start="946.579" dur="8.041">they&amp;#39;re going to do it&amp;#39;s the perfect</text>
  <text start="950.329" dur="8.221">scenario for them and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="954.62" dur="6.779">point that they can say Trump is putting</text>
  <text start="958.55" dur="4.5">forth his economic plans they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="961.399" dur="4.581">to have to wait for the later part of</text>
  <text start="963.05" dur="5.039">this year they can say the economy is</text>
  <text start="965.98" dur="5.49">deteriorating things aren&amp;#39;t going well</text>
  <text start="968.089" dur="6.781">and as the economy falls apart and</text>
  <text start="971.47" dur="5.47">rapidly falls apart they can bring in</text>
  <text start="974.87" dur="5.51">the cyberattacks bring in the bank</text>
  <text start="976.94" dur="8.7">holiday and say Trump is responsible</text>
  <text start="980.38" dur="7.84">Russia North Korea Iran China took it</text>
  <text start="985.64" dur="5.07">Vantage of it and brought down the rest</text>
  <text start="988.22" dur="5.4">and this is why we&amp;#39;re having balance</text>
  <text start="990.71" dur="6.54">right now this is why we&amp;#39;re in a bank</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="5.85">holiday right now and when this does</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="3.27">happen it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="999.47" dur="4.83">disaster</text>
  <text start="1000.52" dur="6.66">even without that as a cover-up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1004.3" dur="5.58">going to be a complete disaster because</text>
  <text start="1007.18" dur="4.59">when the bank holiday occurs you will</text>
  <text start="1009.88" dur="5.49">not be able to get funds out of the bank</text>
  <text start="1011.77" dur="5.19">if they bring down certain PowerGrid to</text>
  <text start="1015.37" dur="3.75">prove that we need to go to war</text>
  <text start="1016.96" dur="5.07">well Foods gonna run out very quickly</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="5.64">running water is gonna stop the clean</text>
  <text start="1022.03" dur="4.62">water is not going to be clean and we</text>
  <text start="1024.76" dur="4.46">can see at this point this is going to</text>
  <text start="1026.65" dur="6.21">be a huge problem across the country and</text>
  <text start="1029.22" dur="7.69">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge</text>
  <text start="1032.86" dur="6.719">build up this huge illusion to make</text>
  <text start="1036.91" dur="6.21">everyone feel comfortable that</text>
  <text start="1039.579" dur="6.481">everything is fine because they cannot</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="6.09">blame anything on Trump right now</text>
  <text start="1046.06" dur="4.95">because it&amp;#39;s too early they need to wait</text>
  <text start="1049.21" dur="3.27">and this is why when we look at Charles</text>
  <text start="1051.01" dur="3.72">Nunn and we look at Harry dent when we</text>
  <text start="1052.48" dur="2.88">look at Cliff high when we look at mark</text>
  <text start="1054.73" dur="2.64">Faber</text>
  <text start="1055.36" dur="5.34">when we look at all these individuals</text>
