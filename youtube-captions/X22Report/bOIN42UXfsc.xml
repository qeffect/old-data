  <text start="805.34" dur="9.09">fall apart I mean it just this is why</text>
  <text start="810.52" dur="7.18">everyone needs to really look at this</text>
  <text start="814.43" dur="6.27">and say you know what we need to start</text>
  <text start="817.7" dur="6.93">to prepare because the outcome of all</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="6.63">this from all the research that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="824.63" dur="5.13">done in the Great Depression and what</text>
  <text start="827.33" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s like to go through a collapse and</text>
  <text start="829.76" dur="5.82">this is going to be even worse than the</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="9.68">Great Depression this is going to be so</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="10.94">bad and take people by surprise that</text>
  <text start="841.78" dur="12.1">it&amp;#39;s really going to be catastrophic and</text>

  <text start="858.29" dur="5.82">what&amp;#39;s going on and they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="860.2" dur="7.78">pretty much crazy and people are going</text>
  <text start="864.11" dur="6.33">to fall into huge depressions there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="867.98" dur="6.72">going to be anger there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="8.37">violence there is going to be anarchy in</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="9.06">the streets and again it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="878.81" dur="7.95">be all over it&amp;#39;s going to be in pockets</text>
  <text start="883.76" dur="6.27">but it will spread as more and more</text>
  <text start="886.76" dur="5.22">people become aware of what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="890.03" dur="7.26">and it will hit people at different</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="7.35">times and its people are going to have</text>
  <text start="897.29" dur="4.29">hope that it will get better it this</text>
  <text start="899.33" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t be happening it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="5.73">the denial process that everyone goes</text>
  <text start="903.68" dur="7.22">through but it when this thing comes</text>
  <text start="907.31" dur="7.11">down from everything that we see and</text>
  <text start="910.9" dur="6.4">everything that the government and the</text>
  <text start="914.42" dur="6.81">central bankers are preparing for I mean</text>

  <text start="923.15" dur="9.78">zero we have a catastrophic event here</text>
  <text start="928.64" dur="7.44">in United States and around the world in</text>
  <text start="932.93" dur="6.65">Europe and everywhere else before or</text>
  <text start="936.08" dur="9.509">another scenario before it happens</text>
  <text start="939.58" dur="9.31">World War three begins and people are</text>
  <text start="945.589" dur="7.201">sent off to war and there is mass</text>
  <text start="948.89" dur="9.44">destruction there is mass deaths I mean</text>
  <text start="952.79" dur="9.359">there is no way out of this it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="958.33" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s almost here and all the pieces are</text>
  <text start="962.149" dur="10.951">all coming together as we can see they</text>
  <text start="965.66" dur="14.94">are even even today on the news they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="973.1" dur="11.79">talking about these crazy white men who</text>
  <text start="980.6" dur="8.28">have guns that could be our biggest</text>
  <text start="984.89" dur="5.52">threat in America and it was funny when</text>
  <text start="988.88" dur="3.81">you watch the video i had it on my site</text>
  <text start="990.41" dur="5.489">you watch the video and in the</text>
  <text start="992.69" dur="6.66">background they&amp;#39;re showing the Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="995.899" dur="7.711">bombing the showing the KKK and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.35" dur="8.28">showing they&amp;#39;re trying to use these</text>
  <text start="1003.61" dur="6.2">pictures for you to believe that these</text>
  <text start="1007.63" dur="6.12">are the crazy people the crazy white man</text>
  <text start="1009.81" dur="6.85">with guns or the crazy or just the crazy</text>
  <text start="1013.75" dur="5.07">people with guns I mean this is what</text>
  <text start="1016.66" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re trying to make you believe but</text>
  <text start="1018.82" dur="6.03">these crazy people with the guns these</text>
  <text start="1021.94" dur="4.53">are these aren&amp;#39;t the crazy people but</text>
  <text start="1024.85" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re trying to make you believe this</text>
  <text start="1026.47" dur="7.709">and you can see from everything that</text>
  <text start="1030.22" dur="9.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing and everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1034.179" dur="7.591">hearing that it&amp;#39;s the pieces are all</text>
  <text start="1039.79" dur="5.549">coming together they&amp;#39;re all fitting</text>
  <text start="1041.77" dur="7.74">together and the outcome is not going to</text>
  <text start="1045.339" dur="6.751">be good it&amp;#39;s not going to be something</text>
  <text start="1049.51" dur="7.47">where we can escape it where we can hope</text>
  <text start="1052.09" dur="10.86">our way out of it it is coming and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1056.98" dur="11.72">only a matter of time and Cyprus seems</text>
  <text start="1062.95" dur="8.1">to be this pivotal pivotal point on</text>
  <text start="1068.7" dur="3.27">what&amp;#39;s going to happen because if you</text>
  <text start="1071.05" dur="3.41">remember</text>
  <text start="1071.97" dur="5.31">the central bankers the government&amp;#39;s yes</text>
  <text start="1074.46" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re preparing but they&amp;#39;re hoping to</text>
  <text start="1077.28" dur="5.67">keep they&amp;#39;re hoping to kick the can down</text>
  <text start="1079.44" dur="6.45">the street so they have more time but</text>
  <text start="1082.95" dur="8.01">there&amp;#39;s one factor that they can never</text>
  <text start="1085.89" dur="8.09">count on is people and panic and when</text>
  <text start="1090.96" dur="7.38">this happens you can&amp;#39;t really control it</text>
  <text start="1093.98" dur="5.98">because if Cyprus if there is some type</text>
  <text start="1098.34" dur="3.99">of bank run and there&amp;#39;s no deal and they</text>
  <text start="1099.96" dur="5.91">collapse and there is a bank run the</text>
  <text start="1102.33" dur="7.8">panic among other countries who are</text>
  <text start="1105.87" dur="12.2">feeling this like Greece Spain it will</text>
  <text start="1110.13" dur="12.419">start a chain reaction so Cyprus is a</text>
  <text start="1118.07" dur="7.12">pivotal point in what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1122.549" dur="5.401">now I mean again they can always figure</text>
  <text start="1125.19" dur="4.05">out a way and and just print money and</text>
  <text start="1127.95" dur="2.55">give it to them and say okay here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1129.24" dur="3">another bailout nobody has to do</text>
  <text start="1130.5" dur="3.36">anything everything&amp;#39;s fine go ahead</text>
  <text start="1132.24" dur="6.9">there might be small little bank runs</text>
  <text start="1133.86" dur="8.73">but again we don&amp;#39;t know how the people</text>
  <text start="1139.14" dur="8.7">are going to react what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1142.59" dur="7.14">do and then if they do nothing everyone</text>
  <text start="1147.84" dur="3.68">will just go back to sleep and the can</text>
  <text start="1149.73" dur="4.53">will be kicked down the street if</text>
  <text start="1151.52" dur="4.93">there&amp;#39;s some type of bank run we have to</text>
  <text start="1154.26" dur="6.45">look at the other countries to see how</text>
  <text start="1156.45" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re going to react so we have to</text>
  <text start="1160.71" dur="9.69">keep an eye on this and we have to see</text>
  <text start="1162.69" dur="10.229">what&amp;#39;s going to happen I like to hear</text>
  <text start="1170.4" dur="4.889">from everyone and I like to hear from</text>
