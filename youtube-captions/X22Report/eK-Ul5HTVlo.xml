  <text start="260.06" dur="6.96">gigantic debt is still there the</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="5.76">interest on that debt is still there</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="8.399">this is where we&amp;#39;re at with the country</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="7.71">and Trump knows it the deep state knows</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="5.371">that the central banks know it they know</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="6.48">what&amp;#39;s going on here the countries in</text>
  <text start="280.79" dur="9.48">the European Union know it this is why</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="8.22">UK Spain France and now the Netherlands</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="4.38">might have to leave the EU we meet we</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="3.99">might need to go back to our own</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="4.32">currency the Netherlands Parliament</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re going to debate leaving the</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="6.12">eurozone the motion approving the</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="3.33">investigation by the Council of the</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="6.9">state the government&amp;#39;s legal adviser</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="7.98">well they&amp;#39;re looking at the Europe</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re saying mmm it&amp;#39;s not working for</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="3.66">us here so they have this probe that</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="2.79">will examine whether it would be</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="5.4">possible for the Dutch to withdraw from</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="7.41">the single currency and if so how it</text>
  <text start="325.88" dur="5.91">would work and we realize that Gert</text>
  <text start="329.54" dur="6.36">Wilders well he&amp;#39;s likely to win the</text>
  <text start="331.79" dur="6.24">Dutch elections and in terms on necks it</text>
  <text start="335.9" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re calling it if Wilder</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="6.39">can get 26% of the vote with another 24%</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="5.19">agreeing there just may be enough votes</text>
  <text start="344.42" dur="5.19">in Parliament for the Netherlands to</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="4.62">abandon the euro now of course this is</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="5.22">assuming the public goes along with this</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="7.1">and we can see that the next odds they</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="6.09">are increasing we see out in the UK</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="4.83">Theresa May she&amp;#39;s a little worried</text>
  <text start="360.92" dur="4.53">because First Minister Nicola Sturgeon</text>
  <text start="362.98" dur="4.81">could call for a second Scottish</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="7.49">independence referendum the moment</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="7.59">negotiations for the EU exit comes up</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="4.87">which might be a problem in triggering</text>
  <text start="375.38" dur="3.36">article 50 which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="377.81" dur="5.93">that they&amp;#39;re going to be doing this</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="9.15">maybe at the same time was this planned</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="7.54">was this planned by the central bankers</text>
  <text start="387.89" dur="4.86">to push a Scottish referendum I mean</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="2.7">last time they had it we know it was</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="3.36">fixed they didn&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="3.96">but this time it could be the opposite</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="3.48">you know what let&amp;#39;s just push it even</text>
  <text start="397.94" dur="4.74">though they&amp;#39;re not gonna leave it we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="6.02">just disrupt the triggering of article</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="7.56">50 remember the central banks don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="7.44">countries leaving the EU because their</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="6.18">system is based on spreading out debt</text>
  <text start="413.05" dur="5.47">more debt to more countries and if</text>
  <text start="416.42" dur="3.69">countries leave they&amp;#39;re in big trouble</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="5.01">because that means more countries are</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="7.46">don&amp;#39;t to leave now out in Spain</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="8.22">we see something that the US will not do</text>
  <text start="427.57" dur="6.43">send bankers to jail now many other</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="5.28">countries except for the United States</text>
  <text start="434" dur="7.02">Krupp bankers are often brought to task</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="6.36">by their respective governments the most</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="5.94">recent example of this of a Krupp banker</text>
  <text start="443.39" dur="4.85">being held accountable for his or her</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="5.25">crimes in Spain</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="8.47">is the former head of the International</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="7.32">Monetary Fund Rodrigo rato and he was</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="5.01">sentenced to four years and six months</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="4.02">behind bars Spain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.72" dur="3.96">national court which deals with</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="6">corruption and financial crime cases</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="7.95">said he was guilty of embezzlement when</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="7.92">he headed up Bankia the people of Spain</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="5.61">were outraged over the scandal and it</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="4.08">was discovered during the height of the</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="4.76">financial crisis in which banks were</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="5.46">receiving millions in taxpayer dollars</text>
  <text start="484" dur="4.51">now although he was sentenced that</text>
  <text start="487.01" dur="5.06">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that he&amp;#39;s going to prison</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="6.18">just yet he&amp;#39;s also a former spanish</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="7.27">economy minister he&amp;#39;s also the former</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="8.4">IMF chief so we see right now that at</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="6.6">this point he&amp;#39;s at liberty pending a</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="6.72">possible appeal because of highly</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="5.79">connected elite status and most likely</text>
  <text start="509.81" dur="4.159">going down the line he might even get</text>
  <text start="511.73" dur="6.78">off the hook and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="6.82">where bankers get off the hook now</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a standoff going on in Greece</text>
  <text start="520.789" dur="5.431">right now about the Greek debt</text>
  <text start="522.77" dur="5.25">nothing has been settled as of yet we</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="5.43">are nowhere closer to an amicable</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="6.51">resolution and Germany&amp;#39;s deputy finance</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="7.08">Finance Minister Jens bond said that</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="6.42">Greece must not be granted a ballon now</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s a very strange thing to say well</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="5.13">he said it because they&amp;#39;re worried that</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="4.62">the creditors would take a loss remember</text>
  <text start="546.08" dur="4.77">a lot of individuals in Greece have</text>
  <text start="548.03" dur="4.08">taken their funds out of the bank and</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re not worried about the people</text>
  <text start="552.11" dur="3.15">that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get their</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="3.48">funds that their money would be tied up</text>
  <text start="555.26" dur="5.55">in the bank they&amp;#39;re worried that the</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="6.78">creditors would not get their money so</text>
  <text start="560.81" dur="5.43">you can see what they&amp;#39;re looking at and</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="6.75">who they really support they support</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="6.15">everyone but the people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="6.12">saying right now nothing has been done</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="7.65">to rectify the problems in Greece</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="5.43">especially with the debt relief now in</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="5.52">Maine in the United States</text>
  <text start="581.78" dur="6.99">republican governor paul lepage well he</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="5.91">started to enforce Maine&amp;#39;s volunteer and</text>
  <text start="588.77" dur="6.36">work requirement food stamp recipients</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="6.27">to keep their benefits now what that</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="5.67">means is is that people are going to</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="6.21">have to find a job look for a job or go</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="7.17">for job training to get the food stamp</text>
  <text start="603.95" dur="6.51">money so right now nine thousand</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="7.5">non-disabled adults are getting dropped</text>
  <text start="610.46" dur="7.53">from the program and they need to go</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="3.9">ahead and do one of those followings and</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="3.36">if they if they don&amp;#39;t do one of the</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="3.69">followings where they&amp;#39;re going to the</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="3.39">training program trying to find work and</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="4.28">things like that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="624.74" dur="5.19">get any food stamp money now the rules</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="5.23">prevent adults who are not disabled and</text>
  <text start="629.93" dur="4.11">do not have dependents from receiving</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="4.68">food stamps for more than three months</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="5.82">unless they work at least 20 hours a</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="6.9">week participate in a work training</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="8.37">program or meet volunteer guidelines for</text>
  <text start="644.15" dur="5.87">24 hours out of the month now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="4.26">gonna do one of these things here</text>
  <text start="650.02" dur="6.55">they&amp;#39;re probably going to go and do the</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="5.94">work training program or meet the</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="3.78">volunteer guidelines and then they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="658.43" dur="4.17">able to receive their food stamp money</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="6.3">is this going to put people back to work</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="6.42">most likely not any one of those three</text>
  <text start="666.65" dur="3.99">minimum getting met will result in the</text>
  <text start="669.02" dur="4.53">individual retaining their SNAP benefits</text>
  <text start="670.64" dur="4.38">and like I said this is not going to</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="3.75">help the job situation because as we</text>
  <text start="675.02" dur="6.5">know the job situation out there is very</text>
  <text start="677.3" dur="8.31">very tough and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="681.52" dur="6.01">here in the United States the economic</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="4.8">indicators are showing us that things</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="5.46">are not improving the job scenario is</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="4.92">not improving I mean we look at real</text>
  <text start="692.99" dur="5.16">estate quite a bit and pending homes</text>
  <text start="695.33" dur="6.27">right now well they were expected to</text>
  <text start="698.15" dur="5.49">rise by 0.6 percent but they plunged by</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="6.57">2.8 percent month a month this is the</text>
  <text start="703.64" dur="6">biggest drop since May now the West the</text>
  <text start="708.17" dur="4.98">most expensive regions saw the biggest</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="5.97">decline down 10.3% month a month the</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="6.2">Midwest tumbling by 5 point 2 percent</text>
  <text start="715.61" dur="6.8">mortgage applications are declining and</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="6.85">we can see if rates move up as they have</text>
  <text start="722.41" dur="4.93">things completely fall apart and this is</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="6.21">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="727.34" dur="9.36">core durable goods well that has</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="6.39">declined also now the headline out there</text>
  <text start="736.7" dur="4.89">is saying that court durable goods</text>
  <text start="738.8" dur="7.17">well it looks fantastic they&amp;#39;re rising</text>
  <text start="741.59" dur="6.09">by 1.8% month on month but when we look</text>
  <text start="745.97" dur="6.32">at the numbers we see they were revised</text>
  <text start="747.68" dur="7.65">back in December you strip out the</text>
  <text start="752.29" dur="5.77">airlines and the military stuff from</text>
  <text start="755.33" dur="8.1">core durable goods well it&amp;#39;s down</text>
  <text start="758.06" dur="7.11">negative 0.2% and the core durable goods</text>
  <text start="763.43" dur="3.36">are like you know washers dryers and</text>
  <text start="765.17" dur="8.61">things like that and when you strip out</text>
  <text start="766.79" dur="10.17">all military type of equipment you get</text>
  <text start="773.78" dur="4.92">the real number and when you throw the</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="5.34">military equipment in there and guess</text>
  <text start="778.7" dur="5.07">what it looks fantastic but when you</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="2.73">strip it away and you look at the real</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="5.28">economy of what people are actually</text>
  <text start="785.03" dur="7.43">doing it&amp;#39;s not working now we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="6.09">many individuals and I have interviewed</text>
  <text start="792.46" dur="6.78">two of them that I&amp;#39;m gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="795.14" dur="8.15">about Charles and then are cliff hi</text>
  <text start="799.24" dur="6.73">Harry dent and now David Stockman</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re all saying the same thing and</text>
  <text start="805.97" dur="6.87">they were using all different methods to</text>
  <text start="808.96" dur="7.39">look at the economy to predict what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.84" dur="5.52">going to happen in the economy and what</text>
  <text start="816.35" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="818.36" dur="7.28">all coming up with the same point in</text>
  <text start="822.14" dur="5.03">time which is this a coincidence</text>
  <text start="825.64" dur="5.62">probably not</text>
  <text start="827.17" dur="7.69">and David Stockman was on Greg hunter</text>
  <text start="831.26" dur="5.31">and he&amp;#39;s saying that come March 15th</text>
  <text start="834.86" dur="3.36">this is when things are going to start</text>
  <text start="836.57" dur="4.77">to fall apart because remember Obama and</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="7.32">Boehner they came up with this debt</text>
  <text start="841.34" dur="6.45">ceiling hard stop and they put it off</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="3.96">until Obama would be out of the White</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="3.99">House and that&amp;#39;s coming up this</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="5.58">March which means the government cannot</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="5.88">borrow any more money they have to use</text>
  <text start="855.08" dur="4.05">the cash that&amp;#39;s on hand and David</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="3.32">Stockman saying they have about 200</text>
  <text start="859.13" dur="5.73">billion in cash which is not a lot</text>
  <text start="860.98" dur="8.68">especially when the government was</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="7.5">spending a trillion a year and we can</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="6.6">see right now that when it&amp;#39;s frozen at</text>
  <text start="872.36" dur="4.83">20 trillion the debt and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="876.26" dur="4.4">borrow anymore</text>
  <text start="877.19" dur="9.83">they&amp;#39;re gonna burn through the cash at</text>
  <text start="880.66" dur="10.33">75 billion a month and come this summer</text>
  <text start="887.02" dur="7.02">they will be out of cash now when we</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="6.72">look at the situation we can see that</text>
  <text start="894.04" dur="7.78">things are going to really go downhill</text>
  <text start="897.71" dur="6.87">very quickly as we go into April we go</text>
  <text start="901.82" dur="4.29">into May we go into June and we go</text>
  <text start="904.58" dur="3.57">throughout the summer months and then</text>
  <text start="906.11" dur="4.56">when we hit the fall time period</text>
  <text start="908.15" dur="5.1">things are gonna rapidly deteriorate</text>
  <text start="910.67" dur="4.53">very very quickly now cliff hi when I</text>
  <text start="913.25" dur="4.38">interviewed him he said that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="915.2" dur="3.86">things are really going to come to a</text>
  <text start="917.63" dur="4.08">screeching halt</text>
  <text start="919.06" dur="5.23">Charles nanner is out there saying from</text>

  <text start="924.29" dur="4.92">to happen in the fall time period</text>
  <text start="927.05" dur="4.89">David Smok Stockman when you look at his</text>
  <text start="929.21" dur="4.53">forecast says the same thing Harry dent</text>
  <text start="931.94" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s saying the same thing now we have</text>
