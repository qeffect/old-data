  <text start="27.61" dur="5.23">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="30.529" dur="5.701">name is dave and this is episode 174 and</text>
  <text start="32.84" dur="5.76">today&amp;#39;s date is September 27 2013 and</text>
  <text start="36.23" dur="4.949">that the title of this episode is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="38.6" dur="4.639">not some Banana Republic this is not a</text>
  <text start="41.179" dur="4.89">deadbeat nation and again this is from</text>
  <text start="43.239" dur="6.131">President Obama when he was giving one</text>
  <text start="46.069" dur="4.95">of his speeches on how the US always</text>
  <text start="49.37" dur="4.649">pays its bills we&amp;#39;re not one of those</text>
  <text start="51.019" dur="6.02">nations that can&amp;#39;t pay its bills but if</text>
  <text start="54.019" dur="7.68">you really think about it the only way</text>
  <text start="57.039" dur="9.281">the u.s. can pay its bills is by</text>
  <text start="61.699" dur="8.011">borrowing money they can&amp;#39;t pay it on the</text>
  <text start="66.32" dur="5.61">revenue they collect from the American</text>
  <text start="69.71" dur="5.79">people the only way they can keep</text>
  <text start="71.93" dur="9.41">government going is to borrow more money</text>
  <text start="75.5" dur="10.95">so in fact the u.s. is a deadbeat nation</text>
  <text start="81.34" dur="8.32">because if this nation was able to work</text>
  <text start="86.45" dur="5.85">and prosper on its own it wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="89.66" dur="6.6">to borrow money and what really happened</text>
  <text start="92.3" dur="6.54">is the u.s. reached its credit card</text>
  <text start="96.26" dur="4.89">limit and they&amp;#39;re looking to get another</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="5.49">credit card because the income they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.15" dur="5.7">bringing in from the people is not</text>
  <text start="104.33" dur="4.98">enough to keep the government and all</text>
  <text start="106.85" dur="5.43">the programs and all the billions of</text>
  <text start="109.31" dur="6">dollars they send over to Egypt and</text>
  <text start="112.28" dur="7.05">Israel and Yemen and all these different</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="7.58">places to keep the Empire going and keep</text>
  <text start="119.33" dur="6.09">all these countries under control and</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="5.259">having all these countries use the US</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="4.83">dollar as a reserve currency it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="4.62">expensive to do this and if you notice</text>
  <text start="130.25" dur="5.879">whenever they talk about shutting down</text>
  <text start="132.769" dur="6">the government or sequester or anything</text>
  <text start="136.129" dur="4.69">like that it never has anything to do</text>
  <text start="138.769" dur="4">with the amount of money</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="5.581">they&amp;#39;re sending overseas to countries</text>
  <text start="142.769" dur="6.39">like Syria to the rebels paid</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="5.399">mercenaries and their funding them with</text>
  <text start="149.159" dur="5.73">billions of dollars to overthrow a</text>
  <text start="151.799" dur="5.16">government but before I get started I</text>
  <text start="154.889" dur="5.371">just want to thank all those know people</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="5.571">who&amp;#39;ve started listening from youtube or</text>

  <text start="211.919" dur="6.81">bombarded by different things and the</text>
  <text start="215.159" dur="6.54">processes were running haywire and they</text>
  <text start="218.729" dur="5.76">help me control it and they are looking</text>
  <text start="221.699" dur="5.671">into what happened and I have no clue</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="6.301">what happened at this time they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="5.819">to let me know and for some people have</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="5.55">slowed down other people it was fine I</text>
  <text start="233.189" dur="4.83">couldn&amp;#39;t even get on to it at the time</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="3.299">and that&amp;#39;s why I had to contact them and</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="6.481">that&amp;#39;s why my report was a little bit</text>
  <text start="239.639" dur="9.18">later than normal but let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="7.259">economic collapse news Italy right now</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="5.461">is having major problems Standard &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="251.759" dur="5.641">Poor&amp;#39;s warned of further downgrade by</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.979">one notch or more and if Italy could not</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="4.559">demonstrate institutional and governance</text>
  <text start="259.259" dur="4.321">effectiveness and right now the Italian</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="4.561">sovereign debt is just two notches above</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="5.85">junk anyhow and we can see that all</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="6.449">these countries in Europe Italy Portugal</text>

  <text start="274.56" dur="6.39">that all have high unemployment and even</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="3.81">though the propaganda is out there</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="4.59">saying that Europe is recovering and</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="6.27">things are going well we can see that is</text>
  <text start="285.54" dur="5.849">pretty much the opposite now in Panama</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re going to have a banking holiday</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="5.131">and they&amp;#39;re using the excuse that</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re upgrading their systems and if</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="4.38">you notice and I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="4.62">before my other reports that normally if</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re going to do some type of banking</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="5.97">holiday it happens on a Friday this way</text>
  <text start="306.9" dur="4.95">people go through the weekend they feel</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="5.4">relaxed and the whatever they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="5.43">to do and whatever money they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="5.13">to steal can be done over the weekend</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="4.74">and by the time people realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="4.95">happening it&amp;#39;s way too late and we saw</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="3.69">some of this happen in Cyprus people</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="2.94">want to sleep they woke up Saturday</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="3.81">morning boom they couldn&amp;#39;t get their</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="4.649">money in other places the same thing</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="5.01">happened and they&amp;#39;re telling everyone by</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="3.901">Tuesday October first there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="334.53" dur="3.92">problem and you&amp;#39;ll be able to get your</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.89">money you can go to the bank and</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="7.18">manually take out your money instead of</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="7.079">using machines and using online things</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="3.53">to maneuver your money but you know what</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="4.621">happens when something like this happens</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="7.84">people tend to run and try to get most</text>
  <text start="352.41" dur="7.29">of their money out and this is why going</text>
  <text start="357" dur="4.32">back who knows how many reports I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="3.18">always said that you should have some</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="3.87">money and take some money out of the</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="6.12">bank have gold and silver physically</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="5.97">with you have cash with you and because</text>
  <text start="369" dur="5.01">you never know when a bank or the</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="4.86">collapse is going to hit you never know</text>
  <text start="374.01" dur="3.93">when it&amp;#39;s going to happen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="5.22">always better to be prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="6.479">for something like this and this goes on</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="5.489">to say that you know where some reasons</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="3.931">for a bank holiday holiday the National</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="5.25">Bank of Panama said it is a system</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="5.52">upgrade and maybe a dollar revaluation</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="3.331">would be coming soon maybe it is</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="4.049">something more serious like a banking</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="6.38">crisis like we had in India Indonesia</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="7.711">back in 97 or more recently in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="6.219">but the clave debit card system has been</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="2.819">taken offline no wire transfers between</text>
  <text start="407.909" dur="3.69">bang</text>
  <text start="408.449" dur="6.33">and internationally unit until the first</text>
  <text start="411.599" dur="6.361">of October and they are able to go to</text>
  <text start="414.779" dur="5.04">the local bank and take out cash now I</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="4.199">don&amp;#39;t know how much they can possibly</text>
  <text start="419.819" dur="5.88">take out or if there are any type of</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="8.48">controls in place but we will see what</text>
  <text start="425.699" dur="7.44">happens with this story now consumer</text>
  <text start="430.639" dur="6.45">sentiment plunges to a five-month low</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="7.53">and this is the biggest miss since 2013</text>
  <text start="437.089" dur="5.8">the first Miss in 2013 the lowest print</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="4.891">since April and the largest two-month</text>
  <text start="442.889" dur="4.62">decline in 2013 this is the first</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="4.529">consecutive monthly drop in 14 months</text>
  <text start="447.509" dur="6.72">and the largest miss first expectations</text>
  <text start="450.089" dur="7.17">on record and as city notes below this</text>
  <text start="454.229" dur="5.761">is the exact same pattern we have seen</text>
  <text start="457.259" dur="5.851">play out in the last two cycles and they</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="7.429">suggest a significant downside risk to</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="7.649">us equities and we&amp;#39;ve been having some</text>
  <text start="467.419" dur="7.24">warnings from different sources like</text>
  <text start="470.759" dur="6.12">Wells Fargo was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="474.659" dur="5.401">the stock market is looking for a huge</text>
  <text start="476.879" dur="4.62">type of downward decline of about you</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="4.56">know sixteen to twenty percent or more</text>
  <text start="481.499" dur="5.551">and I can&amp;#39;t remember the other place but</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="8.359">there was another organization saying</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="10.109">the same exact thing and again the Fed</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="7.451">the US government right now understands</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="8.19">that everything is declining no matter</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="7.169">how much they manipulate GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="505.349" dur="5.22">unemployment it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="507.599" dur="5.461">because they understand the economy the</text>
  <text start="510.569" dur="4.32">US dollar is completely collapsing at</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.339">this point and the only thing that they</text>
  <text start="514.889" dur="5.851">control our numbers the stock market the</text>
  <text start="518.399" dur="4.471">housing industry and they are doing</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="4.17">everything they can to pump it up and</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="7.05">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that the stock</text>
  <text start="524.91" dur="7.56">market has ended up in the red I guess</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="4.349">the high-frequency traders and plunge</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="4.109">protection team tried their best to</text>
  <text start="534.269" dur="5.271">bring it back up but they couldn&amp;#39;t gold</text>
  <text start="536.579" dur="5.551">has moved up a little bit but again the</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="4.66">central bankers are not</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="3.99">going to let gold rise too much they</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="4.17">will continue to smack it down if they</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.47">see it going up way too much they are</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="6.14">going to bring it down this way not to</text>
  <text start="550.59" dur="8.82">alert the people that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="6.7">now we all understand that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="559.41" dur="5.04">government keeps talking about shut down</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="5.67">and you know where we have to fix this</text>
  <text start="564.45" dur="3.96">by October first and Republicans and the</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="3.81">Democrats are going back and forth and</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="5.37">arguing and you know they wanted to fund</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="5.43">Obamacare and you know the President</text>
  <text start="573.78" dur="5.22">Obama saying that he&amp;#39;s not working with</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="6.69">the Republicans that the Congress wants</text>
  <text start="579" dur="5.58">to make cuts and they all know that they</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="3.39">need to raise the debt ceiling because</text>
  <text start="584.58" dur="4.11">otherwise the government just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="586.2" dur="4.41">function even if they do cut it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="4.38">meaningless anyhow the debt will</text>
  <text start="590.61" dur="6.75">continue to rise and we all know this</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="6.27">and this is a huge show yeah it might</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.76">they might go up there going to go up to</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="5.94">the last possible minute and then make a</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="5.02">deal or an emergency type of deal that</text>
  <text start="605.28" dur="3.66">will let them go for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="4.29">who knows maybe they&amp;#39;ll have it shut</text>
  <text start="608.94" dur="4.58">down for like a day or two just so the</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="5.22">American people can really feel it and</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="6.88">you know if they if the government does</text>

  <text start="639.8" dur="6.76">you know and even tax audits might be</text>
  <text start="644.28" dur="6.72">slowed down but that&amp;#39;s not really a bad</text>
  <text start="646.56" dur="7.86">thing because of this shutdown but other</text>
  <text start="651" dur="6.15">things like Obamacare not affected that</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="6.45">won&amp;#39;t be affected at all military no</text>

  <text start="779.67" dur="5.669">need this i have no clue and the only</text>
  <text start="783.029" dur="4.591">reason they would need this is if there</text>
  <text start="785.339" dur="7.411">are riots and they need an armored</text>

  <text start="796.199" dur="5.13">if we look back in time and we see what</text>
  <text start="798.99" dur="4.77">has happened a lot of times colleges and</text>
  <text start="801.329" dur="3.751">things like that do have riots and when</text>
  <text start="803.76" dur="3.69">the collapse comes</text>
  <text start="805.08" dur="4.77">they are probably thinking we need</text>
  <text start="807.45" dur="6.09">something that we can patrol around in</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="8.91">and be safe in to handle people who are</text>
  <text start="813.54" dur="7.71">out there writing and things like that</text>
  <text start="818.76" dur="6.03">and we can see the police state is</text>
  <text start="821.25" dur="5.7">building we see DHS having these armored</text>
  <text start="824.79" dur="4.89">vehicles the police now have these</text>
  <text start="826.95" dur="5.46">armored vehicles and you can see that</text>
  <text start="829.68" dur="4.77">the with with DHS the police the local</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="5.28">authorities they&amp;#39;re all starting to look</text>

  <text start="837.69" dur="5.7">this is all building up for one reason</text>
  <text start="840.78" dur="5.76">and one reason only and that is because</text>
  <text start="843.39" dur="5.76">of the collapse that is coming and this</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="6.93">is why you would need all of this type</text>
  <text start="849.15" dur="7.59">of equipment now since the terrorist</text>
  <text start="853.47" dur="6.81">attack in kenya balls i mentioned this</text>

  <text start="867.3" dur="4.86">people&amp;#39;s bags checked as they enter</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="6.45">moles and we can see that they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="872.16" dur="7.56">these tactically scare tactics and this</text>
  <text start="876.51" dur="7.52">police state mentality to get everyone</text>

  <text start="888.57" dur="5.43">completely violates the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="890.64" dur="5.82">we first saw it happen when we had 911</text>
  <text start="894" dur="4.65">and you go to the airports and now they</text>

  <text start="898.65" dur="3.9">when you try to go into amusement parks</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="4.29">they can search you there and now</text>
  <text start="902.55" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re moving it to moles and things</text>
  <text start="905.1" dur="4.83">like that so wherever you go you are</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="4.62">giving them permission to search you</text>
  <text start="909.93" dur="6.63">which under the Constitution they have</text>

  <text start="920.81" dur="7.35">for the collapse and the police state</text>
  <text start="923.91" dur="8.51">and this is why they continually do this</text>

  <text start="1126.5" dur="6.39">they seemed to be happy with that the</text>
  <text start="1129.05" dur="7.41">the lawyers of the US government are</text>
  <text start="1132.89" dur="6.18">happy with this and what is this chapter</text>
  <text start="1136.46" dur="7.47">7 well basically it&amp;#39;s that they can use</text>
  <text start="1139.07" dur="8.04">military force and what chapter 7</text>
  <text start="1143.93" dur="5.37">Article 42 says is should the Security</text>

  <text start="1174.74" dur="7.08">President Obama was pushing for he</text>
  <text start="1177.53" dur="6.24">wanted chapter 7 Article 42 and all the</text>
  <text start="1181.82" dur="5.67">other articles that lead up to Article</text>
  <text start="1183.77" dur="6.09">42 in there to give them and out because</text>
  <text start="1187.49" dur="4.98">in one of his statements that he made is</text>
  <text start="1189.86" dur="4.83">that you know the UN deal in syria</text>
  <text start="1192.47" dur="5.52">chemical weapons will be enforceable</text>
  <text start="1194.69" dur="5.97">President Obama says he also added that</text>
  <text start="1197.99" dur="4.59">there are concerns about whether the</text>
  <text start="1200.66" dur="4.45">Syrian government would even follow</text>
  <text start="1202.58" dur="5.62">through on its chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1205.11" dur="5.73">commitment and we know the US government</text>
  <text start="1208.2" dur="4.26">has been talking about striking no</text>
  <text start="1210.84" dur="5.19">matter what striking striking striking</text>
  <text start="1212.46" dur="5.64">and they wanted this in this resolution</text>
  <text start="1216.03" dur="6.269">and agreement with Russia Syria and the</text>
  <text start="1218.1" dur="7.65">US and they got it in there and we can</text>
  <text start="1222.299" dur="6.211">see that as soon as Syria does something</text>
  <text start="1225.75" dur="6.9">or there is another false flag they are</text>
  <text start="1228.51" dur="5.58">going to refer to chapter 7 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1232.65" dur="3.12">going to try to go down to peaceful</text>
  <text start="1234.09" dur="4.969">means and then they&amp;#39;re going to hit up</text>
  <text start="1235.77" dur="6.27">upon Article 42 and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="1239.059" dur="5.771">according to our agreement we are going</text>
  <text start="1242.04" dur="12.96">in and we can see how this has been</text>
  <text start="1244.83" dur="14.79">delayed out ok now the experts that have</text>
  <text start="1255" dur="7.85">to do with cyber crime and cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1259.62" dur="5.82">from the US Cyber consequences unit is</text>
  <text start="1262.85" dur="4.3">saying now that the manipulation of</text>
  <text start="1265.44" dur="5.369">international financial markets will be</text>
  <text start="1267.15" dur="5.82">the next evolution of cybercrime by</text>

  <text start="1272.97" dur="4.47">then conducting a cyber attack to</text>
  <text start="1274.83" dur="5.81">discredit a company criminals can make</text>
  <text start="1277.44" dur="6.15">an almost infinite amount of money and</text>

  <text start="1285.9" dur="5.029">move up move down and things like that</text>
  <text start="1288" dur="6.66">and this is what they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="1290.929" dur="7.571">another concern with cyber attacks is</text>
  <text start="1294.66" dur="6.81">the government shutdown the longer the</text>
  <text start="1298.5" dur="7.62">government stay shut down cyber experts</text>
  <text start="1301.47" dur="8.15">are worried about cyber attacks on the</text>
  <text start="1306.12" dur="6.42">financial institutions on government</text>
  <text start="1309.62" dur="7.15">facilities because as more and more</text>
  <text start="1312.54" dur="6.84">people are laid off the offices become</text>
  <text start="1316.77" dur="6.029">quiet and there&amp;#39;s no one to maintain the</text>
  <text start="1319.38" dur="8.64">systems and that could lead to a major</text>
  <text start="1322.799" dur="9.51">cyber attack and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1328.02" dur="5.93">that you know as quiet offices networks</text>
  <text start="1332.309" dur="4.381">left behind by furloughed employees</text>
  <text start="1333.95" dur="4.4">might allow malware that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1336.69" dur="4.77">infiltrated federal</text>
  <text start="1338.35" dur="9.27">networks and it could be really bad if</text>
  <text start="1341.46" dur="9.01">this does happen now of course the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1347.62" dur="5.939">views can you attack a direct threat to</text>
  <text start="1350.47" dur="7.47">national security now any country that</text>
  <text start="1353.559" dur="8.311">has natural resources like gold oil oh</text>
  <text start="1357.94" dur="6.359">and just made an agreement with China to</text>

  <text start="1369.539" dur="7.211">viewing now Kenya a huge rush risk to</text>
  <text start="1374.14" dur="4.68">national security in America so what</text>
  <text start="1376.75" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="1378.82" dur="4.32">dozens of FBI agents to Kenya to</text>
  <text start="1381.22" dur="3.54">investigate the site of the attack and</text>

  <text start="1389.86" dur="5.79">looking at targeted strikes within Kenya</text>

  <text start="1645.66" dur="5.58">to bring down the World Trade Center and</text>

  <text start="1681.63" dur="6.21">understand the US dollar needs to be</text>
  <text start="1684.87" dur="5.64">propped up and in their minds the only</text>
  <text start="1687.84" dur="6.18">way to do this is to get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1690.51" dur="7.02">get into Iran and also now take care of</text>
  <text start="1694.02" dur="5.789">Kenya and any other nation that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1704.04" dur="4.92">themselves and take control over this is</text>

  <text start="1737.049" dur="6.151">almost like 911 where we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1739.69" dur="6.42">many explosions cyber attacks things</text>

  <text start="1748.98" dur="6.639">America is being attacked from all sides</text>

  <text start="1759.07" dur="6">free in the US that can&amp;#39;t be traced at</text>
