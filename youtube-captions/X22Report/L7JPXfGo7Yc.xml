  <text start="115.85" dur="4.98">see gold continually move up we need to</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="5.76">watch it carefully because when it</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="6.78">starts to make gains of 2530 100 150</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="6.48">that is an indicator that this economy</text>
  <text start="127.61" dur="7.64">is about to crash or is crashing at the</text>
  <text start="131.66" dur="6.66">same time and I know the central banks</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="5.14">they continually pull out different</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="4.08">rabbits from their hat they are</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="5.909">continually trying to keep this system</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="7.369">operational keep the illusion alive but</text>
  <text start="146.299" dur="6.381">we know with every illusion illusions</text>
  <text start="149.769" dur="5.521">disintegrate it&amp;#39;s proven over history</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="6.309">throughout history we have seen this</text>
  <text start="155.29" dur="5.319">time and time again it just doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="158.989" dur="3.9">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="160.609" dur="3.661">economic indicators and we can see the</text>
  <text start="162.889" dur="5.811">people driven</text>

  <text start="168.7" dur="6.75">everything the central bankers have set</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="7.41">up cannot support what the people do</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="5.44">because the people actually really have</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="6.09">the final say and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="5.52">right now is the economy&amp;#39;s rapidly</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="3.24">deteriorating not just here in the</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="3.03">United States we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="5.07">deteriorate throughout the world</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="6.44">actually a u.s. think tank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="7.32">putting out a warning that Australia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.88" dur="7.45">housing market is around six weeks away</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.47">from a housing collapse the</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="3.75">International Strategic Studies</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="4.29">Association well they put out this</text>
  <text start="207.08" dur="6.66">morning because what they&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="9.24">that Chinese investment well that might</text>
  <text start="213.74" dur="5.97">be drying up because the efforts to</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="4.08">restrict the Chinese investment in</text>
  <text start="219.71" dur="6.78">Australia real estate that could send</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="6.54">prices tumbling and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="226.49" dur="4.89">is we estimate that the Australia that</text>
  <text start="228.77" dur="4.59">Australia has about six weeks or so to</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="5.04">turn this situation around otherwise</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="5.51">there would be a massive hit on property</text>
  <text start="236.42" dur="6.06">valuations and the building trades and</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="6.089">we know that these markets they are</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="6.479">bubbles that&amp;#39;s pretty much what they are</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="6.431">they are created by investment companies</text>
  <text start="248.959" dur="6.211">hedge funds and foreign investors that</text>
  <text start="251.39" dur="5.37">are coming in and using cash to purchase</text>
  <text start="255.17" dur="4.52">these homes now the investment companies</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="4.949">hedge funds they&amp;#39;re purchasing homes and</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re keeping them off the market</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re buying thousands of them foreign</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="3.39">investors are coming in because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="4.29">looking for a place to park cash and</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="4.98">what we see that this is starting to dry</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="6.38">up not just in Australia but here in the</text>
  <text start="272.48" dur="6.92">United States also and this is the major</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="5.41">driving force in the real estate market</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="7">the people actually are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="9.6">sidelines and we can see as more and</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="9.7">more Australians Canadians the British</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="7.09">the Europeans the Americans that</text>
  <text start="296.1" dur="6.42">as more of them get out of the market</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="7.74">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to keep</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="5.64">the system up again the people actually</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="5.43">really have the final say one way or</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="6.33">another they will make the decision of</text>
  <text start="311.67" dur="6.81">how this all goes think about the</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="6.33">subprime security crisis back in 07 08</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="4.83">yes they kept the illusion alive with</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="5.22">the triple a subprime securities but</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="5.37">eventually the people who were buy one</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="7.49">two three houses not making the payments</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="9.36">on their mortgages that was the final</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="7.53">problem of the illusion that is what</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="5.64">brought everything completely down</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="5.44">because the triple a subprime securities</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="7.29">made no sense because all the loans</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="8.15">inside were defaulting the same thing is</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="7.5">happening now but in different areas I</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="7.75">mean right now the US consumer they are</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="6.54">completely tapped out now ahead of this</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="4.71">week&amp;#39;s retail sales report we have bank</text>
  <text start="365.01" dur="6.84">of america&amp;#39;s internal credit card data</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="7.32">and what it shows is that things are</text>
  <text start="371.85" dur="5.94">getting worse they are not getting</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="6">better now we already saw a weakening in</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="6.3">July retail sales based on both the bank</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="6.3">of American credit card data the Census</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="6.48">Bureau of figures and based on bank of</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="5.52">america we see retail sales x autos fell</text>
  <text start="390.57" dur="5.28">by point one percent month a month in</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="5.88">august this follows the point three</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="4.53">percent month a month decline in july</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.7">and pushes the three months average down</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="5.37">to negative 0.2% now the number would</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="5.31">have been worse if bank of america had</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="6.39">not decided to adjust their data from</text>
  <text start="409.14" dur="7.05">the bankruptcy of sports authority and</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="5.28">the closures of all their stores and we</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="4.31">can see right now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="417.42" dur="7.05">data we see that the back-to-school</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="6.55">sales well they haven&amp;#39;t done very well</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.27">the spending on teen retail and young</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="4.269">adult clothing</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="7.53">form very poorly we see department</text>
  <text start="431.319" dur="8.401">stores we see auto sales not doing well</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="6.179">and when we look at this year on year we</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="6.24">see gasoline stations there down- 12.2</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="6.421">percent home improvement stores are down</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="6.63">negative point six percent home goods is</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="5.79">down negative 2.1 percent kim young</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="3.66">adult clothing is down negative</text>

  <text start="456.25" dur="4.319">down- 1.5% department stores are down</text>
  <text start="459.039" dur="6.75">negative four point six percent</text>
  <text start="460.569" dur="7.861">furniture sales down- 1.5% so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.789" dur="6.361">seeing right now is that the everyday</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="5.579">person they&amp;#39;re tapped out and it looks</text>
  <text start="472.15" dur="3.419">like the central bankers are not getting</text>
  <text start="474.009" dur="4.021">what they want they want people to spend</text>
  <text start="475.569" dur="5.581">because this is a service economy this</text>
  <text start="478.03" dur="5.28">is a spending economy we already know</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s not a manufacturing economy so they</text>
  <text start="483.31" dur="4.77">need people to spend the problem is they</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t force people to spend if they</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="5.639">don&amp;#39;t have discretionary funds and this</text>
  <text start="491.02" dur="6.6">is why we see stores closing down strip</text>
  <text start="493.719" dur="5.04">malls being emptied and the situation is</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="2.49">getting worse because more and more</text>
  <text start="498.759" dur="3.061">people are being laid off as more and</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="5.429">more people are getting laid off they</text>
  <text start="501.82" dur="7.68">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to suspend it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.539" dur="5.551">that simple and this most likely is</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="4.289">going to be a catalyst to bring down the</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="5.749">entire system we see the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="6.81">Index it hit over 800 points it is down</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="5.89">796 down to 796 and we can see when we</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="5.161">look at the Baltic Dry Index it is in a</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="6.061">downward trajectory it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="525.76" dur="6.99">dropping and this is the raw material</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="7.169">that is used to create these goods that</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="5.579">are shipped out to the markets and when</text>
  <text start="535.959" dur="6">people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="538.329" dur="5.581">reason for manufacturers to manufacture</text>
  <text start="541.959" dur="3.961">if they&amp;#39;re not going to manufacture they</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="4.19">don&amp;#39;t need the raw material and this is</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="6.27">what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing fbn</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="7.03">they&amp;#39;re warning that by the dead cat</text>

  <text start="581.25" dur="4.51">deteriorating imploding is getting worse</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="3.55">because we see the head of the</text>
  <text start="585.76" dur="5.509">International Monetary Fund Christine</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="8.97">Lagarde she is already out there telling</text>
