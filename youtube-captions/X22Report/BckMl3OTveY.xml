  <text start="38.85" dur="2.82">saturday before i get started i just</text>
  <text start="40.29" dur="5.49">wanted to make a couple announcements a</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="6.75">fan from Dabu sevens channel emailed me</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="5.849">letting me know that there&amp;#39;s the a clone</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="6">of the x 22 report and they are making</text>
  <text start="51.629" dur="6.451">comments on different youtube channels</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="6">and on the X 22 report channel it is not</text>
  <text start="58.08" dur="6.18">me making these comments if you see this</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="6.42">click on the user name x 22 report if it</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="4.649">doesn&amp;#39;t bring you back to the channel</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="4.8">with all the videos that I produced and</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="7.621">it&amp;#39;s blank then you know it is another</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="6.63">person looking and cloning the x 22</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="5.25">report they&amp;#39;re using the artwork and</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="5.82">everything Dabu 7 has said someone is</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="4.86">going around that looks just like him</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="5.459">making comments on different sites so</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="5.909">again you can see right now I posted a</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="4.621">comment on the Friday&amp;#39;s video with the</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="3.63">link and already they still have the</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="3.9">artwork last I checked they still have</text>
  <text start="96.179" dur="4.201">the artwork up there but they change the</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="3.96">name from x 22 report to memphis so</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re quickly changing the chains and</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="5.939">the names and maneuvering and it looks</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="5.489">like this is just another tactic to try</text>
  <text start="107.969" dur="4.86">to discredit all the alternative media</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="4.801">sites here of course they try to take</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="4.92">down many of our sites and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="4.279">continually trying because i guess they</text>
  <text start="117.749" dur="4.62">just don&amp;#39;t like what we&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="119.659" dur="6.16">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="6.481">news and what we are seeing here is the</text>
  <text start="125.819" dur="6.301">economy is completely collapsing right</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="5.82">in front of our eyes a gallup survey was</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="5.52">taken and most of the people out there</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="5.16">barely can make ends meet and we can see</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.24">by the survey that most of the people</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="3.09">are spent</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="4.47">on things they actually really need</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="3.96">instead of purchasing electronics and</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="4.59">other goods and we look at this</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="6.12">groceries 59 / spent fifty nine percent</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="7.8">spent more ten percent spent less on</text>
  <text start="153" dur="8.13">groceries gasoline fifty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="6.36">spent more twelve percent spent less and</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="4.65">we go down of course there&amp;#39;s toiletry</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s health care and these are the</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="4.8">things that people really need things</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="3.51">that they don&amp;#39;t need or they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="4.77">you know what maybe at this time I</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="6.15">really don&amp;#39;t have to do this I can put</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="6.08">it off retirement savings seventeen</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="6.21">percent spent less leisure activities</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="7.33">thirty-one percent spent less clothing</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="7.38">thirty percent spent less electronics 31</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="5.55">/ 31 percent spent less travel</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="4.38">thirty-eight percent spent less so we</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="5.31">can see right now that most of the</text>
  <text start="196.41" dur="5.78">people right now are using their funds</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.58">to purchase the things they absolutely</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="5.08">absolutely need and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="4.83">seeing a complete implosion of the</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="4.74">retail market and a lot of the companies</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="3.99">like I&amp;#39;ve been mentioning of coming</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="3.45">forth saying you know what it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="214.02" dur="3.06">the weather right now because we went</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="3.96">through the spring we went into the</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="5.25">summer and guess what our sales are</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="6.21">still declining and we have to recognize</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="5.82">that a lot of retail stores have been</text>
  <text start="225.63" dur="5.34">closing they&amp;#39;re going out of business</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.76">and everyone&amp;#39;s saying well it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="6.06">of online no just like gap reported</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="7.47">online sales brick-and-mortar sales they</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="6.9">are all down they are not improving so</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="4.8">all of this talk about online is taking</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="4.98">away from brick-and-mortar not true</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="4.98">whatsoever and we can see that even</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="5.07">during the winter months if this was</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="5.46">actually true online sales would have</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="5.16">been skyrocketing people just sitting in</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="3.6">their house staring at the snow saying I</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t want to go out in this cold</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="4.56">weather so I&amp;#39;m just going to purchase</text>
  <text start="262.17" dur="4.07">like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow online and</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="5.67">guess what this did not happen</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="7.91">whatsoever now the governor out in</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="5.77">Nebraska governor dave Heineman</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s blasted federal officials Friday</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="5.73">for refusing to give him details about</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="5.25">the 200 undocumented children who have</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="5.55">been placed in Nebraska and US senator</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="5.19">mike johannes confirm their placement</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="4.5">there the governor said that he had no</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="5.43">idea what was going on until the past 24</text>
  <text start="292" dur="4.71">to 48 hours although he said we had some</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.65">suspicions he said it was outrageous</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="4.53">that the federal officials are declining</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.28">to give him information about the kids</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="6.96">whereabouts and this is just amazing the</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="7.12">most transparent administration is</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="5.16">keeping everyone in the dark because</text>
  <text start="310.99" dur="4.86">they really don&amp;#39;t want anyone to realize</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re all these children are going that</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="4.8">they have certain illnesses that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.04" dur="5.19">being used to push certain agendas Ford</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="4.32">like the immigration bill like to put</text>
  <text start="323.23" dur="3.12">these children on Obamacare like to</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="3.86">bring up their grandparents their</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="5.01">parents give them work permits and</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="5.77">yesterday I mentioned about this deal in</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="6.81">Central America where there they want to</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="6.9">give aid down there but attached to this</text>
  <text start="338.17" dur="5.64">Aid is the mount Santo GMO seeds and</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="3.93">Central America does not want these</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="4.83">seeds because their Freight is going to</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="5.28">completely destroy their agricultural</text>
  <text start="348.64" dur="5.49">down there and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="350.71" dur="5.16">maybe this is some type of trade and the</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="4.05">Obama administration is saying you know</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="4.08">hey listen we&amp;#39;ll take some children up</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="5.04">here if you take these seeds because</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="5.58">Monsanto pays us a lot of money and they</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="4.14">back our campaigns and we have to do</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="4.8">what they say and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="6.18">pushing this and everyone is confused of</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="5.46">where all these children&amp;#39;s are headed</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="4.74">off to most of the town&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="375.79" dur="4.23">even being warned they&amp;#39;re not being told</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="4.26">anything but they do have plenty of</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="4.98">guards to guard all of these children</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s take these guards bring them down</text>
  <text start="385" dur="5.19">to the borders and let&amp;#39;s protect the</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="4.71">borders now that beast train that brings</text>
  <text start="390.19" dur="3.21">the children up from Central America</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="3.21">through Mexico of course the Mexican</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="3.87">government never doesn&amp;#39;t even stop the</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="4.92">train so they must have a deal with the</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="6.09">United States government the Train kinda</text>
  <text start="399.7" dur="7.47">derailed and it looks like it&amp;#39;s stranded</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="4.529">about 1300 children and this was stuck</text>
  <text start="407.17" dur="4.44">in men</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="6.93">echo now the armed militia they are</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="5.07">setting up a command center in Texas to</text>
  <text start="414.819" dur="3.72">fight for national sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="5.009">militia has set up a command center</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="4.951">south of San Antonio to prepare for what</text>
  <text start="421.689" dur="4.07">they say is a mission to protect the</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="5.94">United States from the influx of illegal</text>
  <text start="425.759" dur="5.62">immigrants we have Patriots all across</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="4.53">the country or willing to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="431.379" dur="4.59">their time their monies even quit their</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="4.049">jobs that come down and fight for</text>

  <text start="441.789" dur="4.38">does not endorse or support any private</text>
  <text start="444.49" dur="3.69">group or organization from taking</text>
  <text start="446.169" dur="3.84">matters into their own hands as it could</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="5.639">have disastrous personal and public</text>
  <text start="450.009" dur="5.671">safety consequences the CBP appreciates</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="5.07">the efforts of concerned citizens as</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="4.949">they act as our eyes and ears securing</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="6">our nation&amp;#39;s borders can be very</text>
  <text start="460.629" dur="6.9">dangerous you know interacting with drug</text>
  <text start="464.889" dur="5.761">dealers the children coming over the</text>
  <text start="467.529" dur="5.1">terrorists and you know having to fight</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="5.039">them off can be very very dangerous and</text>
  <text start="472.629" dur="6.361">the US requires very highly trained</text>
  <text start="475.689" dur="5.19">people to do this well if you don&amp;#39;t step</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="3.78">back from your job and you actually go</text>
  <text start="480.879" dur="3.421">to the borders and you protect them then</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="3.48">all these people wouldn&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="3.95">here but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="4.919">border agents I&amp;#39;ve been I guess</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.96">instructed to step away and let all</text>
  <text start="491.169" dur="4.23">these people through and this is why the</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="4.5">people of America are saying you know</text>
  <text start="495.399" dur="4.26">what we need to do something but we have</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="4.139">to be very careful because there could</text>
  <text start="499.659" dur="4.591">be an agent provocateur in the group</text>
  <text start="501.849" dur="4.141">this is the same most of them are the</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="4.56">same group that we&amp;#39;re at the Bundy ranch</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="5.31">now here and you can see they might be</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="4.979">you know set up where we can see an</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="4.409">agent provocateur shooting someone</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="5.581">coming across the border and then all of</text>
  <text start="515.709" dur="5.49">a sudden we see the the United States</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="4.68">government come down hard on these</text>
  <text start="521.199" dur="5.281">volition the militia people and we can</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="9.42">see how they can completely set all of</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="9.539">this up now Amnesty International is out</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="5.25">there and Amnesty International has</text>
  <text start="536.019" dur="5.171">urged the UN to urgently mandate an</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="5.32">independent international investigation</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="4.59">into israel&amp;#39;s air strikes on gaza as</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="4.2">well as Palestine indiscriminate</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="4.38">shelling of Israel despite claims by</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="4.65">Israel that its operations protective</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="5.03">edge launched June eighth targets Hamas</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="4.59">militants most of more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="5.59">Palestines killed in air strikes in gaza</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="5.58">are civilians now I&amp;#39;ve seen the videos i</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="4.89">seen the knock on the buildings and i</text>
  <text start="563.06" dur="6.39">have to wonder what exactly they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="6">doing here because they&amp;#39;re letting they</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="5.4">are letting so call the people be worn</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="5.34">by phone calls emails a knock on top</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="3.75">with an explosion to let them come out</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="4.17">of the building and then they destroy</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="5.16">the building what in the world is the</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="3.93">purpose of this destroying all the</text>
  <text start="583.76" dur="4.71">structures unless they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="6.6">clear the land and it seems like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="6.33">their intention at this point but right</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="5.25">now Amnesty International they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="5.42">looking at this whole entire situation</text>
  <text start="596.96" dur="6.93">and something just doesn&amp;#39;t seem right</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.71">and they went on to say that unless the</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="4.44">Israeli authorities can provide specific</text>
  <text start="605.93" dur="4.47">information to show how a home is being</text>
  <text start="608.33" dur="4.02">used to make an effective contribution</text>
  <text start="610.4" dur="4.11">to military actions deliberately</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="4.68">attacking civilian homes constitutes a</text>
  <text start="614.51" dur="4.62">war crime and also amounts to collective</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="5.46">punishment against the family set m mr.</text>
  <text start="619.13" dur="5.69">Luthor so we can see right now the UN is</text>
  <text start="622.49" dur="4.53">saying they should have a ceasefire and</text>
  <text start="624.82" dur="3.85">Amnesty International is out there</text>
  <text start="627.02" dur="6.53">saying we need to look into this of what</text>
  <text start="628.67" dur="8.52">exactly is going on and this this is a</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="5.41">situation where the times of Israel is</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="3.81">out there saying that other groups are</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="3.93">taking responsibility for what happened</text>
  <text start="641" dur="4.05">to the three teens so I think everyone</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="4.35">should just stop right now think about</text>
  <text start="645.05" dur="6.15">what&amp;#39;s really going on unless there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="6.69">different agenda going on here now in</text>
  <text start="651.2" dur="6.83">Yemen what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="653.93" dur="6.99">tribesmen are are attacking the oil</text>
  <text start="658.03" dur="4.9">pipelines right now trying to shut them</text>

  <text start="662.93" dur="2.94">States government central bankers are in</text>
  <text start="664.55" dur="4.08">each one of these Middle East countries</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;ve removed the government set</text>
  <text start="668.63" dur="3.72">up a puppet government and all these</text>
  <text start="670.7" dur="3.21">other people now are called al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="2.31">these are the tribes of the country</text>
  <text start="673.91" dur="2.94">trying</text>
  <text start="674.66" dur="5.369">you fight back and take back their</text>
  <text start="676.85" dur="6.27">country and of course they did this to</text>
  <text start="680.029" dur="5.04">prop up the dollar they wanted each one</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="3.659">of these countries selling the oil using</text>
  <text start="685.069" dur="3.96">the US dollar so there are other</text>
  <text start="686.779" dur="3.99">countries around the world how to keep</text>
  <text start="689.029" dur="3.93">US dollars in reserves because you have</text>
  <text start="690.769" dur="3.901">to remember if all of these countries</text>
  <text start="692.959" dur="3.271">the tribes take back their country and</text>
  <text start="694.67" dur="4.62">kick out the private western central</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="5.039">bank and and they sell the oil not using</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="3.779">the dollar other countries don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="701.269" dur="3.901">keep the doll in reserve and then what</text>
  <text start="703.069" dur="3.96">we see is dollars heading back to the</text>
  <text start="705.17" dur="3.659">United States when we see dollars</text>
  <text start="707.029" dur="4.651">heading back to the United States that D</text>
  <text start="708.829" dur="4.95">values the dollar we see inflation and</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="4.11">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right at this</text>
  <text start="713.779" dur="3.99">time because what&amp;#39;s happening many</text>
  <text start="715.79" dur="3.719">countries are starting to remove dollars</text>
  <text start="717.769" dur="3.81">from reserves ramped up in other</text>
  <text start="719.509" dur="3.63">currencies and they&amp;#39;re just protecting</text>
  <text start="721.579" dur="5.12">themselves because they see the dollar</text>
  <text start="723.139" dur="6.331">pretty much is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="726.699" dur="6.791">tribesmen blew up Yemen&amp;#39;s main oil</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="6.57">pipeline halting deliveries the sabotage</text>

  <text start="745.67" dur="5.339">its its income inside the country here</text>
  <text start="748.939" dur="4.801">and we can see that the United States</text>
  <text start="751.009" dur="5.101">central bankers use the drones in each</text>
  <text start="753.74" dur="3.99">one of these countries to push the</text>
  <text start="756.11" dur="4.349">people back and they have to call them</text>
  <text start="757.73" dur="6.15">al Qaeda because Congress allows the</text>

  <text start="763.88" dur="4.579">terrorists with drone attacks so this is</text>
  <text start="766.25" dur="4.889">why they need to call everyone al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="768.459" dur="5.081">now it looks like in Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="771.139" dur="4.89">fighting is just intensifying their it</text>

  <text start="788.24" dur="4.8">into Russia and then Russia returned</text>
  <text start="790.519" dur="5.07">fire and they stopped firing so we can</text>

  <text start="853.49" dur="4.08">resources and it&amp;#39;s money like what they</text>
  <text start="855.68" dur="4.53">did during the days of Saddam in Iraq</text>
  <text start="857.57" dur="4.8">and we can see that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="860.21" dur="5.13">pushed forward they&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="862.37" dur="6.48">in every single region Syria Lebanon</text>
  <text start="865.34" dur="5.52">Libya and create major major chaos and</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="4.77">of course the United States government</text>
  <text start="870.86" dur="5.85">would love to get involved and start</text>
  <text start="873.62" dur="5.04">some type of war in this area and this</text>
  <text start="876.71" dur="4.11">is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do and</text>
  <text start="878.66" dur="6.02">this is why we have every government</text>
  <text start="880.82" dur="6.66">official out there pushing the agenda of</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="4.93">terrorism and every single time</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="5.33">something else happens they continually</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="6.03">push it right now we see that</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="5.56">representative peter king he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="895.64" dur="5.52">and he is very concerned about the</text>
  <text start="898.37" dur="4.53">stolen radioactive material and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="901.16" dur="3.96">saying that even though obama is</text>
  <text start="902.9" dur="3.92">downplaying that they can they really</text>
  <text start="905.12" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t do anything with this radioactive</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="6.22">material he is out there saying well if</text>
  <text start="909.62" dur="8.04">you have radioactive material you can</text>
  <text start="913.04" dur="7.32">case it in explosives and use this as a</text>

  <text start="920.36" dur="3.72">all over the place it&amp;#39;s amazing how he</text>
  <text start="922.28" dur="3.72">knows how to build one of these so you</text>
  <text start="924.08" dur="3.24">can see they&amp;#39;re continually pushing this</text>
  <text start="926" dur="3.42">and they want this to come out here</text>
  <text start="927.32" dur="4.71">because they need the propaganda to</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="5.04">flood the corporate media to convince</text>
  <text start="932.03" dur="5.22">every single American that the Islamist</text>
  <text start="934.46" dur="4.26">the Islamic state is coming after the</text>
  <text start="937.25" dur="3.63">United States and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="938.72" dur="5.79">interesting and everyone&amp;#39;s wondering</text>
  <text start="940.88" dur="6.06">why isn&amp;#39;t Isis helping Hamas in in the</text>
  <text start="944.51" dur="4.65">battle with Israel and right now the</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="4.95">Islamic state has responded to critics</text>
  <text start="949.16" dur="5.43">who have questioned why its leader bagga</text>
  <text start="951.89" dur="5.82">daddy is not actively supporting Hamas</text>
  <text start="954.59" dur="5.19">and fighting Israel he says we have a</text>
  <text start="957.71" dur="4.02">couple of stages that we need to go</text>
  <text start="959.78" dur="4.62">through before we can actually hit</text>
  <text start="961.73" dur="5.46">Israel we need a we&amp;#39;re building a firm</text>
  <text start="964.4" dur="5.28">base for an Islamic state in Iraq using</text>
  <text start="967.19" dur="5.43">using it as a springboard to wage war in</text>
  <text start="969.68" dur="4.95">Syria and Lebanon and have already been</text>
  <text start="972.62" dur="3.69">achieved but he said a number of other</text>
  <text start="974.63" dur="4.14">criteria still needed to be fulfilled</text>
  <text start="976.31" dur="7.82">before challenging Israel basically what</text>
  <text start="978.77" dur="9.21">he&amp;#39;s saying is that they need to weaken</text>
  <text start="984.13" dur="8.32">politically and economically the United</text>
  <text start="987.98" dur="8.58">States first as well as the US interests</text>
  <text start="992.45" dur="7.83">in other countries and then once they do</text>
  <text start="996.56" dur="6.99">that and once they get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1000.28" dur="5.55">remove Assad there then they can head</text>
  <text start="1003.55" dur="3.57">over to Israel I don&amp;#39;t know just</text>
  <text start="1005.83" dur="3.21">something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right so they</text>
  <text start="1007.12" dur="3.84">want to go after United States first of</text>
  <text start="1009.04" dur="4.95">course we need that event to cover up</text>
  <text start="1010.96" dur="6.36">the economic collapse then they need to</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="5.99">take over the greater Syria and remove</text>
  <text start="1017.32" dur="4.83">Assad and then they can go to Israel</text>
  <text start="1019.98" dur="4.66">something just seems out of whack here</text>
  <text start="1022.15" dur="6">and we have to remember all of this</text>
  <text start="1024.64" dur="6.39">being that all of this is being pushed</text>
  <text start="1028.15" dur="5.4">forward the propaganda is that the</text>
