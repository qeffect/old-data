  <text start="100.6" dur="4.08">corporate media they&amp;#39;re making a really</text>
  <text start="102.009" dur="4.321">big deal about the Senate health care</text>
  <text start="104.68" dur="4.74">bill where they&amp;#39;re going to postpone it</text>
  <text start="106.33" dur="5.67">after July 4th and we can see that</text>
  <text start="109.42" dur="5.809">Obamacare well that&amp;#39;s the Affordable</text>
  <text start="112" dur="6.38">Care Act that is completely dying and</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="6.791">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the 19th</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="7.21">Obamacare co-op well it just collapsed</text>
  <text start="122.02" dur="5.82">now there are only four left for 2018</text>

  <text start="129.67" dur="5.33">withdrawing from the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="131.59" dur="6.75">exchanges in 2018 and it looks like</text>
  <text start="135" dur="6.489">Obamacare is just completely imploding</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="9.39">on itself right now and again if this</text>
  <text start="141.489" dur="10.051">was a good health care system people</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="6.599">would come out in droves to get this</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="4.86">health care but when you see deductibles</text>
  <text start="154.329" dur="4.401">rising when you see premiums continually</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="5.399">moving up and you can see your options</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="6.37">dwindling there&amp;#39;s a problem here</text>
  <text start="161.799" dur="6.361">especially when you put penalties on</text>
  <text start="165.1" dur="6.389">people who don&amp;#39;t take your junk if you</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="7.169">have to force someone to take health</text>
  <text start="171.489" dur="7.201">care by penalizing them that means you</text>
  <text start="175.329" dur="6.391">don&amp;#39;t have a good product and that</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="4.41">people are speaking up because it</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.32">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what Trump is saying if</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="5.58">the people actually thought</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="4.259">that this was good for them they would</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="3.869">get it because premiums would be low</text>
  <text start="190.299" dur="5.16">deductibles would be low and the health</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="4.08">care plans would be amazing but people</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="1.76">are looking to saying I can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="196.629" dur="3.69">this</text>
  <text start="197.219" dur="6.49">secondly they didn&amp;#39;t take into account</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="5.881">how bad the economy is where people are</text>
  <text start="203.709" dur="6">struggling to survive every single day</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="5.67">on one part-time to part-time or a</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="5.76">full-time job that&amp;#39;s not paying that</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="5.58">much and we can see that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.469" dur="3.99">take into account any of this they just</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="4.11">try to push it on us and of course they</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="4.051">exempted themselves now this other</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="4.14">health care that the Senate&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="4.409">push or Trump is trying to push it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="225.7" dur="5.069">going to be any better what we need to</text>
  <text start="227.919" dur="4.831">do is we need to get rid of the health</text>
  <text start="230.769" dur="4.62">care industry we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="5.73">certain corporations certain influences</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="6.6">within government and we need the people</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="6.379">to say this is what we want this is what</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="6.06">we need this is something we could use</text>
  <text start="244.859" dur="5.44">instead they&amp;#39;re telling us what is good</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="5.851">for us it should be the other way around</text>
  <text start="250.299" dur="6.93">now Project Veritas they came out with a</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="5.73">bombshell yesterday showing that CNN</text>
  <text start="257.229" dur="5.22">producer didn&amp;#39;t believe that the Russian</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.52">story was at all real there was no</text>
  <text start="262.449" dur="5.22">evidence there&amp;#39;s nothing today they came</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="5.549">out with something else and this time</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="6.03">CNN Van Jones well he got caught</text>
  <text start="270.699" dur="6.391">revealing his true thoughts on CNN and</text>
  <text start="273.699" dur="7.701">the Russian meddling narrative and he</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="6.81">said this is one big nothing burger the</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="4.269">project Veritas reporter what do you</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="4.53">think is going to happen this week with</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="5.581">the whole Russian thing Van Jones the</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="5.28">Russian thing is just a big nothing</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="5.82">burger the Peavey reporter said really</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="6.87">Van Jones says yeah and we can see right</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="6.24">now we all knew this was absolutely</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="5.61">nothing there was nothing there and this</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="4.26">is why we can see the American public</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="3.81">when they look at the corporate media</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="4.26">when they look at these newspapers they</text>
  <text start="310" dur="3.75">start to realize you know something we</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="5.82">can&amp;#39;t trust them Gallup did a survey and</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="5.819">they have found that 27 percent well</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re the only ones who have confident</text>
  <text start="319.569" dur="8.61">in the newspaper the other percentage</text>
  <text start="323.319" dur="7.671">the 73% they don&amp;#39;t have confidence in</text>
  <text start="328.179" dur="6.931">the paper now if we go back to 1990</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="6.34">there was a record 39% - had confidence</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="3.72">in the newspaper according to Gallup and</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="3.299">it looks like this percentage is</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.109">continually dropping yes and there are</text>
  <text start="340.629" dur="3.96">times when the percentage moves up a</text>
  <text start="342.939" dur="3.301">little bit moves down a little bit but</text>
  <text start="344.589" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the trend where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="5.34">been moving down now CNN is basically</text>
  <text start="349.809" dur="3.54">saying that because of this whole</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="4.619">Russian collusion her ratings are going</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="5.52">up but is it really because people are</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="5.25">flocking to CNN or are they just moving</text>
  <text start="358.869" dur="6.09">from different corporate media stations</text>
  <text start="361.449" dur="5.37">to them and we could see this is exactly</text>
  <text start="364.959" dur="3.901">what is happening they&amp;#39;re just shuffling</text>
  <text start="366.819" dur="3.84">people around and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="3.809">convince everyone that everyone is</text>
  <text start="370.659" dur="4.201">watching them but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="5.55">from everything that&amp;#39;s coming out we</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="6.809">knew for a very long time that this was</text>
  <text start="378.219" dur="6.93">fake news now since the whole Russian</text>
  <text start="381.669" dur="5.25">collusion the Russian cyberattacks or</text>
  <text start="385.149" dur="4.23">the election is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="386.919" dur="3.99">we see that certain corporate media</text>
  <text start="389.379" dur="4.74">publications like The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="390.909" dur="5.79">The Washington journal and many others</text>
  <text start="394.119" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re backtracking now on the</text>
  <text start="396.699" dur="5.25">narrative of the story and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="4.92">saying now is that most of the technical</text>
  <text start="401.949" dur="4.53">intelligence used by the Obama</text>
  <text start="403.899" dur="4.62">administration to allege that Moscow</text>
  <text start="406.479" dur="3.78">interfered in the 2016 presidential</text>
  <text start="408.519" dur="3.8">election well that came from other</text>
  <text start="410.259" dur="5.91">countries and these other countries</text>
  <text start="412.319" dur="5.68">handed him bad information now what</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="417.999" dur="4.56">grasping for straws they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="419.709" dur="5.1">figure out a way out of this actually</text>
  <text start="422.559" dur="3.96">Moscow they&amp;#39;re out there and this is</text>
  <text start="424.809" dur="3.5">coming from foreign ministry spokesman</text>
  <text start="426.519" dur="6.57">Maria Zakharova</text>
  <text start="428.309" dur="7.241">she is saying that Moscow well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="433.089" dur="5.31">been told to be quiet on certain things</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="5.789">and they&amp;#39;re saying that Obama had</text>
  <text start="438.399" dur="6.06">strange habits regarding US Russia</text>
  <text start="441.339" dur="4.92">diplomatic relations and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="444.459" dur="3.69">that Russia&amp;#39;s no longer going to keep</text>
  <text start="446.259" dur="3.69">the secrets they&amp;#39;re going to let them</text>
  <text start="448.149" dur="4.56">all out now</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="3.551">Zakhar ovah she explains that over the</text>
  <text start="452.709" dur="2.231">past through</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="3.48">years we&amp;#39;ve seen many strange things</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="5.58">happen in Washington the US State</text>
  <text start="456.98" dur="6.06">Department has more than once asked us</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="5.43">not to announce planned visits until the</text>
  <text start="463.04" dur="4.47">last minute we did as they asked but a</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="2.97">day or two later the information was</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="3.56">leaked by the US State Department and</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="4.56">sometimes by the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="4.3">frankly this put Russia and the media in</text>
  <text start="473.48" dur="3.81">a strange situation because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="4.92">know who to believe the official</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="5.6">agencies or the many leaks and it was</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="6.12">very strange the way this was done and</text>
  <text start="482.89" dur="7.18">they disclosed that no longer are they</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="6.87">going to keep these little secrets that</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="5.25">they had between them and the Obama</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="5.88">administration and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="6.21">listen during Obama there was no way we</text>
  <text start="499.16" dur="5.78">could rebuild the relationship but with</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="5.1">Trump yes we would like to rebuild</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="3.67">relationship between the United States</text>
  <text start="506.63" dur="3.84">and Russia and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="508.61" dur="5.309">corporate media out there they are</text>
  <text start="510.47" dur="6.6">playing up that certain individuals</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="6.24">within government are trying to convince</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="5.76">Trump that Russia is the enemy and Trump</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="7.381">is saying no no they&amp;#39;re not and again</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="7.2">Russia is not the enemy it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="527.54" dur="4.47">individuals within government called the</text>
  <text start="530.03" dur="4.11">deep State the neocons of the central</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="5.46">banks they are the ones who are the</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="5.94">enemy to the United States of America so</text>
  <text start="537.47" dur="5.49">why are they pushing so hard to convince</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="4.86">him that Russia is the enemy because</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="4.17">what they&amp;#39;re really trying to do is</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re trying to create this conflict</text>
  <text start="547.13" dur="6.72">to get us into war and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="6.18">keep this whole narrative moving forward</text>

  <text start="555.92" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>

  <text start="774.55" dur="5.83">were to prepare operations to carry out</text>
  <text start="777.74" dur="5.04">the plan now the report noted that the</text>

  <text start="791.83" dur="5.08">considered staging a coup in North Korea</text>
  <text start="794.57" dur="4.77">now I believe that this is what this</text>

  <text start="799.34" dur="4.59">Sony Pictures about having a regime</text>

  <text start="806.48" dur="4.89">thing well it didn&amp;#39;t really work out now</text>
  <text start="809.03" dur="4.11">North Korea is out there saying that</text>

  <text start="818.35" dur="8.38">that their entire plan was to remove kim</text>
  <text start="822.77" dur="5.85">jong hoon and replace him with a puppet</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="3.36">leader and have a puppet government in</text>
  <text start="828.62" dur="3.96">North Korea but it looks like this</text>
  <text start="830.09" dur="4.53">didn&amp;#39;t go well at all we see that the</text>
  <text start="832.58" dur="3.9">Islamic state they are collapsing under</text>
  <text start="834.62" dur="5.01">the boot of the Syrian army in Deir</text>

  <text start="844.76" dur="5.76">groups well it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time</text>
  <text start="846.83" dur="5.97">before they&amp;#39;re all wiped out and that</text>
  <text start="850.52" dur="4.28">means the deep state well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.8" dur="4.01">running out of time so</text>
  <text start="854.8" dur="4.44">one one or two things are going to</text>
  <text start="856.81" dur="6.48">happen they&amp;#39;re going to create an event</text>
  <text start="859.24" dur="7.02">an event of all events and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="863.29" dur="5.4">start a war or they&amp;#39;re just going to be</text>
  <text start="866.26" dur="6.36">beaten and that is it because really</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="6.39">what other choices do they have not many</text>
  <text start="872.62" dur="5.01">it might be a third one in there where</text>
  <text start="875.08" dur="4.77">they can say oh the Kurds want this part</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="6.72">of Syria but then again you have Russia</text>
  <text start="879.85" dur="8.37">you have China you have Iran you have</text>
  <text start="884.35" dur="5.609">Syria they all must agree to this and I</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="889.959" dur="8.361">now this ransomware that is out there</text>
  <text start="894.22" dur="8.369">this may be a smokescreen for maybe a</text>
  <text start="898.32" dur="6.67">larger type of cyber attack because</text>
  <text start="902.589" dur="4.291">already we&amp;#39;re starting to see that NATO</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="3.99">is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="906.88" dur="4.89">listen these cyber attacks it could</text>
  <text start="908.98" dur="5.549">trigger Article five and if we see a</text>
  <text start="911.77" dur="5.28">bigger cyber attack and we know what</text>
  <text start="914.529" dur="5.581">country has done this we could trigger</text>
  <text start="917.05" dur="6.029">trigger Article five this is the mutual</text>
  <text start="920.11" dur="5.46">defense commitment and we&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="923.079" dur="4.981">attack that country now this is very</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="3.84">scary because they can just pick any</text>
  <text start="928.06" dur="3.69">country and they can show your proof</text>
  <text start="929.41" dur="4.14">without having any proof they could just</text>
  <text start="931.75" dur="5.1">say yes this is what it is and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="933.55" dur="5.039">done this many times before where later</text>
  <text start="936.85" dur="5.6">on it turns out to be completely fake</text>
  <text start="938.589" dur="6.12">phony and false but this ransomware is</text>
  <text start="942.45" dur="5.41">hitting many different areas right now</text>
  <text start="944.709" dur="5.641">and we can see that there is a way to</text>
  <text start="947.86" dur="6.09">get around it someone came up with a</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="5.97">digital vaccine and users must simply</text>
  <text start="953.95" dur="6.57">create a read-only file with the title P</text>
  <text start="956.32" dur="7.32">E or F C place it in there see windows</text>
  <text start="960.52" dur="5.42">folder this will stop the attack dead in</text>
  <text start="963.64" dur="4.889">its tracks it does not however prevent</text>
  <text start="965.94" dur="5.95">infection to other machines it just</text>
  <text start="968.529" dur="5.341">stops it on that system so if you&amp;#39;re one</text>
  <text start="971.89" dur="4.29">of those people that got infected you</text>
  <text start="973.87" dur="4.05">might want to try this and you might</text>
  <text start="976.18" dur="3.54">want to see if this works before you</text>
  <text start="977.92" dur="4.98">actually pay the ransom which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="6.54">think many people do anyhow now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="982.9" dur="4.79">learned from vult seven this is coming</text>
  <text start="986.26" dur="5.42">from WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="987.69" dur="5.64">that there&amp;#39;s this exploit that the CIA</text>
  <text start="991.68" dur="5.22">uses and there&amp;#39;s many of them that they</text>
  <text start="993.33" dur="6.69">use it&amp;#39;s called Elsa Els a it is a</text>
  <text start="996.9" dur="5.07">malware used to track Wi-Fi and able</text>
  <text start="1000.02" dur="5.19">devices running Microsoft Windows</text>
  <text start="1001.97" dur="5.1">allowing the CIA to gather location data</text>
  <text start="1005.21" dur="5.7">now you don&amp;#39;t have to have your GPS on</text>
  <text start="1007.07" dur="7.35">because they use the Wi-Fi to pinpoint</text>
  <text start="1010.91" dur="6.48">where you are the malware allows the CIA</text>
  <text start="1014.42" dur="4.77">to track targets location even when</text>
  <text start="1017.39" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re not connected to the Internet</text>
  <text start="1019.19" dur="5.759">all that&amp;#39;s needed is for the device to</text>
  <text start="1022.13" dur="5.97">be Wi-Fi enabled and in the area where</text>
  <text start="1024.949" dur="6.901">Wi-Fi access points are in rage using</text>
  <text start="1028.1" dur="5.25">Wi-Fi they can pinpoint where you are</text>
  <text start="1031.85" dur="7.05">and this is how they can track</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="7.05">individuals now we know yesterday and we</text>
  <text start="1038.9" dur="3.15">could see it all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="1040.4" dur="4.919">media we could see it on the alternative</text>
  <text start="1042.05" dur="5.82">media one Seymour Hersh came out with an</text>
  <text start="1045.319" dur="5.521">article investigated report showing that</text>
  <text start="1047.87" dur="5.1">this chemical attack never really</text>
  <text start="1050.84" dur="6.03">happened and Trump actually fired</text>
  <text start="1052.97" dur="6.09">missiles on the Intel that he had now</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="3.96">remember it hit a base which was</text>
  <text start="1059.06" dur="3.72">completely cleared out I believe this</text>
  <text start="1060.83" dur="4.38">was completely planned and it was a</text>
  <text start="1062.78" dur="4.44">complete setup for a complete</text>
  <text start="1065.21" dur="7.08">distraction and the corporate media went</text>
  <text start="1067.22" dur="9.42">along with it this time there was</text>
  <text start="1072.29" dur="6.63">information that was leaked out from the</text>
  <text start="1076.64" dur="4.08">White House from a source that was very</text>
  <text start="1078.92" dur="5.85">close to the White House to the</text>
  <text start="1080.72" dur="5.25">corporate media stating that Assad is</text>
  <text start="1084.77" dur="2.85">getting prepared and ready to use</text>
  <text start="1085.97" dur="5.16">chemical weapons now first of all if</text>
  <text start="1087.62" dur="6.87">you&amp;#39;re going to have a false flag you</text>
  <text start="1091.13" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t mention this ahead of time you can</text>
  <text start="1094.49" dur="5.7">use words like well if he crosses the</text>
  <text start="1097.13" dur="6.48">red line if this happens but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1100.19" dur="5.73">leak the information if we look in the</text>
  <text start="1103.61" dur="6.72">past of all these false flags it makes</text>
  <text start="1105.92" dur="8.25">no sense to tell the country or the</text>
  <text start="1110.33" dur="7.41">group of what you&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="1114.17" dur="6.29">makes no sense the only reason you would</text>
  <text start="1117.74" dur="5.99">do this is if you&amp;#39;re trying to trance</text>
  <text start="1120.46" dur="6.18">for information now what I think</text>
  <text start="1123.73" dur="6.06">happened here is that the White House</text>
  <text start="1126.64" dur="5.37">received Intel they didn&amp;#39;t tell the</text>
  <text start="1129.79" dur="4.74">Pentagon they didn&amp;#39;t tell other</text>
  <text start="1132.01" dur="6.05">departments because they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="1134.53" dur="6.24">of who was part of this entire operation</text>
  <text start="1138.06" dur="5.2">because he still doesn&amp;#39;t know who he can</text>
  <text start="1140.77" dur="4.71">trust and there&amp;#39;s leaks all over the</text>
  <text start="1143.26" dur="6.03">place as we know there&amp;#39;s also spying</text>
  <text start="1145.48" dur="6.9">going on within the White House so this</text>
  <text start="1149.29" dur="6.21">information was leaked to send a warning</text>
  <text start="1152.38" dur="5.67">message now you say well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1155.5" dur="5.76">ridiculous why would he do that</text>
  <text start="1158.05" dur="5.07">well remember Mueller is still doing an</text>
  <text start="1161.26" dur="5.01">investigation about Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="1163.12" dur="5.75">and whatever he&amp;#39;s doing and they would</text>
  <text start="1166.27" dur="6.93">use this against Trump if he actually</text>
  <text start="1168.87" dur="6.19">went out of his way to call Russia or to</text>
  <text start="1173.2" dur="5.25">try to send a message they would capture</text>
  <text start="1175.06" dur="7.83">this you know this but to say it out in</text>
  <text start="1178.45" dur="10.29">the public well he just avoided all of</text>
  <text start="1182.89" dur="8.28">it and it allowed Syria and Russia to</text>
  <text start="1188.74" dur="5.58">say okay we know what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1191.17" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re going to try to use another</text>
  <text start="1194.32" dur="5.91">chemical attack and remember to create</text>
  <text start="1197.5" dur="5.25">these false flags they have to prep for</text>
  <text start="1200.23" dur="5.46">it they have to get everything ready</text>
  <text start="1202.75" dur="5.07">everything in place so it looks real</text>
  <text start="1205.69" dur="4.2">even though we can pinpoint things out</text>
  <text start="1207.82" dur="5.04">that are completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="1209.89" dur="4.98">and this was going to be used to</text>
  <text start="1212.86" dur="6.17">basically send more troops</text>
  <text start="1214.87" dur="8.9">maybe bomb more infrastructure in Syria</text>
  <text start="1219.03" dur="8.08">now did Trump back himself into a corner</text>
  <text start="1223.77" dur="5.5">maybe because let&amp;#39;s say they go through</text>
  <text start="1227.11" dur="3.42">with the false flag what is Trump going</text>
  <text start="1229.27" dur="4.2">to do at this point</text>
  <text start="1230.53" dur="4.29">is he going to go in and bomb or he</text>
  <text start="1233.47" dur="4.02">could just say let&amp;#39;s have an</text>
  <text start="1234.82" dur="6.96">investigation of how this came about is</text>
  <text start="1237.49" dur="7.77">this truly what happened was this a</text>
  <text start="1241.78" dur="7.2">chemical attack let Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1245.26" dur="4.89">decide what really happened here now of</text>
  <text start="1248.98" dur="2.31">course corporate media will say well</text>
  <text start="1250.15" dur="4">they&amp;#39;re the ones responsible for this</text>
  <text start="1251.29" dur="7.03">you can&amp;#39;t let that happen okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1254.15" dur="5.91">set in a team from these countries maybe</text>
  <text start="1258.32" dur="5.85">China well they&amp;#39;re not going to like</text>
  <text start="1260.06" dur="5.43">that so he has ways of getting around</text>
  <text start="1264.17" dur="2.46">this it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1265.49" dur="2.61">is going to like this doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="1266.63" dur="3.81">deep states going to like this but he</text>
  <text start="1268.1" dur="4.65">can use other countries not the</text>
  <text start="1270.44" dur="4.95">coalition forces other countries to</text>
  <text start="1272.75" dur="5.01">inspect what happened now I think what</text>
  <text start="1275.39" dur="4.29">happened here is that they stopped</text>
  <text start="1277.76" dur="5.25">whatever the deep state was trying to do</text>
  <text start="1279.68" dur="5.07">and I don&amp;#39;t think this came about</text>
  <text start="1283.01" dur="3.99">because of the seymour hersh article</text>
  <text start="1284.75" dur="4.74">which was a very good article i mean it</text>
  <text start="1287" dur="4.44">was very well laid out and yes he does</text>
  <text start="1289.49" dur="5.52">show that this chemical weapons attack</text>
  <text start="1291.44" dur="5.31">never really happened I think what was</text>
  <text start="1295.01" dur="3.96">happening here is that the deep State</text>
  <text start="1296.75" dur="5.58">they were getting prepared to do this</text>
  <text start="1298.97" dur="7.53">again his article just so happened to</text>
  <text start="1302.33" dur="6.24">come out at the same exact time and we</text>
  <text start="1306.5" dur="5.4">can see right now that mattis is out</text>
  <text start="1308.57" dur="6.21">there saying that the Assad regime in</text>
  <text start="1311.9" dur="4.26">Syria has taken president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1314.78" dur="3.96">warning against launching another</text>
  <text start="1316.16" dur="3.99">chemical attack seriously and he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1318.74" dur="2.61">going to do it really he knows this</text>
  <text start="1320.15" dur="5.22">information know what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1321.35" dur="7.35">saying is that Russia Syria and ran they</text>

  <text start="1328.7" dur="5.94">happening they know where to look they</text>
  <text start="1331.31" dur="6.39">know what to expect if anything does</text>
  <text start="1334.64" dur="5.19">happen now mattis was out there and he</text>
  <text start="1337.7" dur="6.48">is pledging to limit the involvement of</text>
  <text start="1339.83" dur="6">the US in Syria to anti-isis operations</text>

  <text start="1350.57" dur="4.8">have to watch to see if this actually</text>
  <text start="1352.22" dur="6.15">happens what I see happening here is</text>
  <text start="1355.37" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1358.37" dur="7.11">tensions everywhere while the deep state</text>
  <text start="1361.25" dur="7.86">is trying to ratchet them up now we know</text>
  <text start="1365.48" dur="7.08">right now that things are very tricky in</text>
  <text start="1369.11" dur="6.27">this area we see US surveillance planes</text>
  <text start="1372.56" dur="5.28">well they&amp;#39;ve been flying around Syria</text>
  <text start="1375.38" dur="4.71">after the warning of weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="1377.84" dur="5.4">destruction the chemical attack and we</text>

  <text start="1386.69" dur="2.86">Poseidon</text>

  <text start="1391.2" dur="5.25">traffic notice that these planes were</text>
  <text start="1393.39" dur="4.71">monitoring the coast and you know trying</text>
  <text start="1396.45" dur="4.44">to pick up anything if anything happens</text>
  <text start="1398.1" dur="7.11">one thing that we do know is that the</text>
  <text start="1400.89" dur="7.02">USS George HW Bush well it is left the</text>
  <text start="1405.21" dur="6.78">area and it is enroute to the Israel</text>
  <text start="1407.91" dur="7.38">port of Haifa so it is left the area it</text>
  <text start="1411.99" dur="6.45">is no longer there so we can see right</text>
  <text start="1415.29" dur="4.95">now that all these aircraft carriers</text>
  <text start="1418.44" dur="4.08">they saying that they&amp;#39;re bringing in and</text>
  <text start="1420.24" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re going to war it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="1422.52" dur="5.76">happening now we know that the deep</text>
  <text start="1425.28" dur="5.67">state is not happy with what Trump is</text>
  <text start="1428.28" dur="5.25">doing with his individuals and remember</text>
  <text start="1430.95" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s not just Trump I say Trump but</text>
  <text start="1433.53" dur="5.07">there are certain individuals behind the</text>
  <text start="1435.57" dur="6">scenes that are directing Trump helping</text>
  <text start="1438.6" dur="5.13">him and putting plans together it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1441.57" dur="4.17">just one individual who&amp;#39;s sitting there</text>
  <text start="1443.73" dur="4.41">doing all this and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1445.74" dur="4.95">deep state well they&amp;#39;re not very happy</text>
  <text start="1448.14" dur="4.59">about this because out Newsweek and the</text>
  <text start="1450.69" dur="5.42">corporate media they have articles like</text>
  <text start="1452.73" dur="7.89">in Syria Trump is letting Iran and Assad</text>
  <text start="1456.11" dur="7.84">when you can tell right there and then</text>
  <text start="1460.62" dur="5.7">that they don&amp;#39;t like what he is doing in</text>
  <text start="1463.95" dur="5.13">serve because it&amp;#39;s the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="1466.32" dur="5.79">they want done what they want done is</text>
  <text start="1469.08" dur="5.94">they want to go after Iran they want to</text>
  <text start="1472.11" dur="5.04">go after Assad what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1475.02" dur="3.54">trying to back out of all this now when</text>
  <text start="1477.15" dur="4.49">we look at the deep state you have to</text>
  <text start="1478.56" dur="5.64">remember they have been intertwined into</text>
  <text start="1481.64" dur="5.77">government in departments into the</text>
  <text start="1484.2" dur="4.8">corporate media and their tentacles are</text>
  <text start="1487.41" dur="4.71">everywhere</text>
  <text start="1489" dur="5.16">you just can&amp;#39;t pull it out it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1492.12" dur="3.48">difficult to do so what you need to do</text>
  <text start="1494.16" dur="4.23">is you need to cut off a little part</text>
  <text start="1495.6" dur="6.12">here cut off a little part here destroy</text>
  <text start="1498.39" dur="5.55">them there before you can remove the</text>
  <text start="1501.72" dur="4.35">deep state and if you really look at the</text>
  <text start="1503.94" dur="4.65">actions of what he&amp;#39;s doing yes has Trump</text>
  <text start="1506.07" dur="4.05">done everything he promised well it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1508.59" dur="3.15">little difficult to do everything you</text>
  <text start="1510.12" dur="4.08">promised when you have another force</text>
  <text start="1511.74" dur="6.48">against you when they&amp;#39;re keeping you</text>
  <text start="1514.2" dur="5.18">busy with other things but what he has</text>
  <text start="1518.22" dur="4.76">done is</text>
  <text start="1519.38" dur="5.94">slowly but surely trying to cut away at</text>
  <text start="1522.98" dur="4.62">all these tentacles within government</text>
  <text start="1525.32" dur="4.89">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1527.6" dur="3.93">he&amp;#39;s not just him but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="1530.21" dur="3.69">individuals are going to be able to</text>
  <text start="1531.53" dur="4.769">remove the deep state and this process</text>
  <text start="1533.9" dur="4.68">has already started and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1536.299" dur="5.551">see him do more and more things as time</text>
  <text start="1538.58" dur="6.69">goes on and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="1541.85" dur="6.3">deep state they&amp;#39;re completely backed</text>
  <text start="1545.27" dur="6.96">into a corner they only have a couple</text>
  <text start="1548.15" dur="6.84">options left and you can see that once</text>

  <text start="1554.99" dur="4.2">well they come out with their claws and</text>
  <text start="1557.179" dur="4.5">this is what we should be nervous about</text>
  <text start="1559.19" dur="5.16">right now because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="1561.679" dur="5.73">that this is the end of the deep state</text>
  <text start="1564.35" dur="5.76">and they&amp;#39;re going to strike back any way</text>
