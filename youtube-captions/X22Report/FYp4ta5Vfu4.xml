  <text start="250.38" dur="4.68">the Dow look at the Dow and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.6" dur="4.56">going to continually do this but what</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="6.179">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="7.74">breakdown of different economic sectors</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="6.271">and this is what normally happens right</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="6.06">before crash the economy in the</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="6.15">background breaks down and it spreads to</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.34">each sector and each sector gets worse</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="5.55">and worse and worse while they keep all</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="5.369">eyes on the stock market we saw this</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="4.29">happen in 1929 we saw this happen during</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="5.041">each one of the recession&amp;#39;s we saw it</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="6.06">happen in 2008 and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.06">that people since the elections are</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="5.25">saying WOW everything feels so great and</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="4.29">gallop they&amp;#39;ve done a survey and they</text>
  <text start="294.81" dur="3.6">say there&amp;#39;s been a dramatic shift</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="4.75">remember when Obama I mean he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="6.39">president but during his eight years or</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="6.919">so well Gallup reported that optimism</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="7.23">well it really wasn&amp;#39;t there it was</text>
  <text start="307.729" dur="6.821">negative people didn&amp;#39;t think the economy</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="7.05">was really doing as well as it is</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="9.66">didn&amp;#39;t have that much hope and now after</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="10.05">the elections we see that it went from</text>
  <text start="324.21" dur="8.16">negative to positive and it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="5.34">reversal now this is an illusion right</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="3.45">now I know many people want to believe</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="3.15">this many people want to believe that</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.35">while things are just completely turned</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="4.26">around and everything&amp;#39;s fine but what</text>
  <text start="340.17" dur="7.28">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that nothing has really</text>
  <text start="341.88" dur="8.63">changed except for the stock market and</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="7.3">even small business owners right now</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="7.15">they&amp;#39;re saying that we we have hope but</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="5.84">we don&amp;#39;t have the sales we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="9.78">the business business is not doing well</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="8.47">our sales are dismal so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="3.42">looking at the economy and we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="369.06" dur="5.22">we don&amp;#39;t have that much hope right now</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="8.64">and that it&amp;#39;s going to get better</text>

  <text start="584.76" dur="2.88">everyone we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="585.81" dur="5.13">pensions they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="7.88">pay people out and we can see this</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="8.97">spreading across the country again</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="6.85">things have not improved actually behind</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="7.44">the scenes behind the illusion behind</text>
  <text start="602.37" dur="9.27">the stock market it&amp;#39;s declining and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.35" dur="6.39">getting worse day by day and you know</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.1">what happens at the very end the whole</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.76">thing just comes down we see us import</text>
  <text start="616.74" dur="6.18">prices they have declined for 28</text>
  <text start="619.5" dur="8.22">straight months now during the Great</text>

  <text start="634.62" dur="7.29">prices declining and the government</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="5.54">right now the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="5.34">not reporting we&amp;#39;re in a recession and</text>
  <text start="644.87" dur="4.63">remember they don&amp;#39;t report that written</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="6.47">recession until we&amp;#39;re in the recession</text>
  <text start="649.5" dur="7.74">many many months or sometimes they do it</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="5.38">after it&amp;#39;s over but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="657.24" dur="4.02">things are definitely falling apart</text>

  <text start="661.26" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re not getting better whatsoever</text>

  <text start="671.07" dur="5.22">were going to do it this year they said</text>
  <text start="673.65" dur="4.11">they might do it more than once well</text>
  <text start="676.29" dur="4.77">they haven&amp;#39;t done it once just yet and</text>
  <text start="677.76" dur="5.43">we have about two and a half weeks left</text>
  <text start="681.06" dur="5.16">in this year now they have a meeting</text>

  <text start="688.23" dur="6.59">increase interest rates and the last</text>
  <text start="692.34" dur="10.25">time they did this was last december and</text>
  <text start="694.82" dur="13.42">they did this into a quad witching and</text>
  <text start="702.59" dur="9.04">when they did this what did we see what</text>
