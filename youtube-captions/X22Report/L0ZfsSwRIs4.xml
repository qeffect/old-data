  <text start="89.64" dur="9.78">the US UK we are starting to see a</text>
  <text start="96.049" dur="4.991">similar theme where each one of these</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="5.28">areas are telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="5.43">everything is fine that the economies</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="4.29">are going to be doing much much better</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="7.439">maybe the end of this year beginning of</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="7.379">next year and what&amp;#39;s evident is that the</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="4.53">economic indicators that we look at tell</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="4.051">a completely different story from what</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="3.561">the central banks are telling us and</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="6.69">what the government&amp;#39;s are telling us and</text>
  <text start="122" dur="8.29">if we look out in Europe a survey from</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.31">the European Union&amp;#39;s executive arm show</text>
  <text start="130.29" dur="7.07">that the economic confidence across the</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="12.48">block fell in March for a third month</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="10.599">running to a 13 month low so what is</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="7.53">happening here people are no longer</text>
  <text start="147.959" dur="5.941">believing they don&amp;#39;t believe what the</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.14">central bank what the government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="5.13">saying anymore the European Commission</text>
  <text start="156.57" dur="5.27">said its economic sentiment indicator</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="4.92">fell by 0 point nine percent to 100 and</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="5.52">3.0 and March</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="6.99">was a bigger fall than anticipated and</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="8.11">has reinforced worries about the economy</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="8.1">throughout Europe and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="6.42">Europe Japan which has been holding on</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="6.479">for dear life we see there is a six</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="7.37">point two percent collapse in Japanese</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="7.47">industrial production in February and</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="6.91">this is the most since 2011 when we have</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="5.641">its tsunami there and when we look at</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="7.23">this we see that industrial production</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="9.389">is absolutely awful since 2011 going</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="7.22">forward in some cases it&amp;#39;s running</text>
  <text start="208.019" dur="9.661">longer than the great recession period</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="10.899">and when we look at these indicators</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="6.93">every single day we&amp;#39;re starting to build</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="5.31">a picture here it&amp;#39;s not about looking at</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="4.26">one thing we&amp;#39;re looking at many</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="4.981">different things each day and tracking</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.25">them to see how they&amp;#39;re doing and when</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="5.67">we go back in time we see that these</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="8.04">economic indicators are painting a story</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="6.99">showing us that things are declining</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="4.65">their deteriorating right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="3.78">not getting any better now does that</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="4.11">mean the government is going to say all</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="6.12">of a sudden hey you know what we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="5.189">depression everyone and we kind of lied</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="4.5">about everything we manipulated these</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="5.701">numbers know the government the central</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="5.76">bank will never do that they will lie</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="6.66">until the very end they will continue to</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="5.52">lie on top of their lives and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="2.61">continually manipulate the economy</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="4.59">actually when we&amp;#39;re going through the</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="5.79">Great Recession of 2008 they really</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="5.149">didn&amp;#39;t want to admit it they started</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="6.6">pointing fingers everywhere else but</text>
  <text start="279.889" dur="5.201">will you know where the blame was it was</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="5.4">the big banks it was the central bank it</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="8.759">was Wall Street it&amp;#39;s all the same right</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="8.43">now nothing has improved now ATP they</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="4.171">released their job numbers and against</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="2.31">expectation</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="4.859">about a hundred ninety-five thousand</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="6.38">game ATP reported 200,000 from a</text>
  <text start="302.879" dur="7.921">downward downwardly revised 205,000</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="7.87">which was 214,000 in February now we</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="5.28">know manufacturing is weak and we know</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="4.89">the service sector has been propping up</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="5.369">the US and how long can the service</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="4.979">sector continually prop up the u.s. well</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="4.261">not that long because we see the</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="3.9">restaurant indicator showing us that</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.19">things are completely falling apart we</text>
  <text start="327.629" dur="7.44">know retail is falling apart and when we</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="9.21">look at the ASM services employment that</text>
  <text start="335.069" dur="9.451">has been plummeting and declining now as</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="6.989">that continually plummets ATP is trying</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="5.519">to convince us that the service sector</text>
  <text start="347.099" dur="5.31">is continually adding jobs while the is</text>
  <text start="350.039" dur="7.47">M services employment is showing the</text>
  <text start="352.409" dur="9.111">opposite and Mark Zandi is saying the</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="6.78">economy is doing very well ignored GDP</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="4.899">we&amp;#39;re telling you it&amp;#39;s fine everything</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="3.961">is fine now it was very interesting has</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ve been looking back in reports and</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="6.24">every time ADP comes out with their</text>
  <text start="370.409" dur="7.07">report that everything is fine it seems</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="5.94">that companies lay off a lot of people</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="4.75">during the same period I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="3.209">this is done on purpose to convince</text>
  <text start="382.229" dur="4.261">everyone that everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="4.5">let&amp;#39;s throw these numbers in here so no</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="4.14">one really makes a big deal but IBM</text>
  <text start="388.139" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re laying off a thousand workers in</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="6.509">Germany boeing is going to terminate</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="7.579">between 4,000 and 4500 workers and state</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="9.09">street corp is plain planning to lay off</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="9.97">7,000 people the layoffs just keep on</text>
  <text start="406.229" dur="7.8">comin and we can see at this point if we</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="6.541">are in this incredible recovery why</text>
  <text start="414.029" dur="6.271">isn&amp;#39;t business expanding why isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="4.59">retail expanding we should see expansion</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="8.63">all over the place but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="9.82">contraction these are the facts now</text>
  <text start="428.93" dur="6.11">during this recovery</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="8.43">we see that many of the people in the US</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="7.71">are having a problem getting by and if</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="4.95">we go back to two thousand four we see</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="6.96">the medium income has fallen by thirteen</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="9.69">percent but expenditures has increased</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="7.23">by fourteen percent pew finds that while</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="5.34">all households had less slack in their</text>
  <text start="456.94" dur="7.02">budgets in 2014 and in 2004 lower-income</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="6.329">households went into the red x over 2300</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="6.57">dollars in other words approximately</text>
  <text start="466.389" dur="6.451">one-third of americans were no longer to</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="5.37">cover their core necessities like food</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="5.79">housing transportation with their</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="6.75">average income according to pew</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="7.05">household spent more in 2014 than they</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="6.18">did in 1996 after adjusting for</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="4.709">inflation the typical household saw its</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="4.2">expenditures grow by more than</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="4.171">twenty-five percent from twenty nine</text>

  <text start="501.099" dur="6.841">not kept up from 2004 to 2008 median</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="5.79">household income grew by only one point</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="7.729">five percent while expenditures meeting</text>
  <text start="511.389" dur="8.7">expenditures increased by eleven percent</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="6.341">but perhaps worst of all is that the</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="4.261">typical us households in the center of</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="5.61">the income distribution range which is</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="7.89">the true middle class have seen their</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="7.2">income after meeting all expenses plunge</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="5.789">from seventeen thousand and real terms a</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="6.72">decade ago to a poultry six thousand as</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="8.341">of 2014 that is a plunge of sixty-five</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="7.32">percent so it looks like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="4.71">collapsing it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="6.66">harder for people to make ends meet and</text>
  <text start="551.08" dur="5.85">as more layoffs occur guess what people</text>
  <text start="555.52" dur="3.09">are not going to find those full-time</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="3.84">high-paying jobs they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="558.61" dur="3.75">finding part time jobs they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="4.14">be falling off the market because there</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="3.04">are no jobs out there and this is going</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="5.02">to get</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="8.25">worse and worse as time goes on now Bank</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="6.93">of America they&amp;#39;ve looked at the US</text>
  <text start="573.65" dur="7.5">housing market and they are saying that</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="8.58">the housing market right now is over</text>

  <text start="602.75" dur="6.12">York City real estate market and we can</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="7.25">see at this point that things are</text>
  <text start="608.87" dur="7.64">starting to rip apart start to crack and</text>
  <text start="613.66" dur="7.81">things are starting to look a lot like</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="7.66">2007 going into 2008 and this is not a</text>
  <text start="621.47" dur="6.21">good sign at this point this tells us</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="7.44">that we&amp;#39;re headed into an area where</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="6.96">things are rapidly changing the economy</text>
  <text start="631.61" dur="6.54">is changing and what I mean by changing</text>
  <text start="634.64" dur="6.03">its rearing its ugly head where the</text>
  <text start="638.15" dur="4.29">government where the Fed can&amp;#39;t say oh</text>
  <text start="640.67" dur="3.78">yeah that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter if</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="4.22">housing is continually going down they</text>
  <text start="644.45" dur="4.41">tried that back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="3.76">where they said yeah housing is going</text>
  <text start="648.86" dur="3.39">down but we&amp;#39;ve never seen it really drop</text>
  <text start="650.42" dur="5.31">off don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s going to spring</text>
  <text start="652.25" dur="6.45">back and it didn&amp;#39;t it didn&amp;#39;t do it in</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="6.9">that year they told us that everything</text>
  <text start="658.7" dur="6.51">was contained during 2008 well it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="662.63" dur="7.02">they said AIG would only need one</text>
  <text start="665.21" dur="6.51">bailout but they didn&amp;#39;t so we can see</text>
  <text start="669.65" dur="5.94">right now things are really starting to</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="7.59">fall apart things are starting to look a</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="7.92">lot like 2008 the only problem is that</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="9.12">things are much much worse and when this</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="8.79">hits it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific now the</text>
  <text start="688.43" dur="10.02">United States is warning about a global</text>

  <text start="742.91" dur="3.69">to manipulate these numbers because</text>
  <text start="745.04" dur="6.39">essential bankers want what they want</text>
