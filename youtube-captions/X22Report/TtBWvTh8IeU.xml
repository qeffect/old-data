  <text start="198.1" dur="3.57">recession coming because all the</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="5.37">indicators look like it and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="5.4">to happen in 2020 let&amp;#39;s scare the people</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="4.68">into thinking that there is a recession</text>
  <text start="207.07" dur="5.4">coming which then they then then in turn</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="6.51">would stop spending they would keep</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="6.2">their funds because we remember 70% of</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="5.72">GDP is people spending their funds and</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="6.31">maybe we can cause a recession that way</text>

  <text start="224.98" dur="10.07">tactic has failed now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="9.27">say that the economy will not save Trump</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="4.12">even if it&amp;#39;s strace stays strong next</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="2.9">year</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="4.41">now political scientist John Side&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="3.91">argues and this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="4.41">Washington Post that these are not</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="4.89">normal times and Trump&amp;#39;s reelection is</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="4.11">in far more trouble than many would</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="4.47">expect given the state of the economy</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="4.889">the title of the article is why Trump</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.34">isn&amp;#39;t getting credit from voters for</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="4.951">good economic news and it says voters</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="3.57">aren&amp;#39;t giving Trump much credit for the</text>

  <text start="263.86" dur="5.64">re-election less smooth than it</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="6.24">otherwise should be given the impressive</text>
  <text start="269.5" dur="5.49">statistics they&amp;#39;re saying that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="4.68">approval rating has imposed even though</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.19">people&amp;#39;s views of the economy have grown</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="4.92">more positive since he took office in</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="4.54">2017 yes his numbers have budged they</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="4.41">moved up we&amp;#39;ll be discussing this a</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="4.67">little bit later in the next report but</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="8.339">they&amp;#39;re trying to make people believe</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="9.959">that the economy is ok but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.969" dur="6.33">not going to help them with the economy</text>
  <text start="298.349" dur="6.04">this is going to fail because every</text>
  <text start="301.299" dur="3.811">single person understands if jobs are</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="3.51">coming back</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="4.259">if those at the lower level couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.899" dur="3.51">find jobs and they have jobs</text>
  <text start="309.369" dur="3.69">if those at the lower level are making</text>
  <text start="311.409" dur="4.83">more money because wages are increasing</text>
  <text start="313.059" dur="8.67">right now for those jobs they understand</text>
  <text start="316.239" dur="9.75">that yes I like this if you get a tax</text>
  <text start="321.729" dur="6.72">break people like this corporations like</text>
  <text start="325.989" dur="6.27">this and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.449" dur="7.47">seeing since Trump signed the new tax</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="6.601">cuts into law in 2017 US companies have</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="4.83">repatriated 1 trillion back to the</text>

  <text start="389.499" dur="5.63">to take those funds and spend it in the</text>
  <text start="392.079" dur="6.69">economy compared to what we had before</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="5.47">where we had Obamacare health insurance</text>

  <text start="421.989" dur="5.67">preparing the transition economy we know</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="7.38">out in China right now they do a lot of</text>
  <text start="427.659" dur="7.26">manufacturing for technology and that is</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="6.81">because the rare earth processing is in</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="5.03">China here in the United States because</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="4.65">of us environmental laws regulations</text>

  <text start="448.689" dur="7.921">decided we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute why has this</text>
  <text start="452.949" dur="6.18">been done a lot of these laws this US</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="6.029">environmental laws they are put into</text>

  <text start="462.639" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re doing this for a good cause but in</text>
  <text start="465.429" dur="6.17">reality what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.579" dur="5.4">using these type of laws to push</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="4.84">manufacturing jobs and everything else</text>
  <text start="473.979" dur="5.07">out of this country and into other</text>
  <text start="476.439" dur="6.57">countries and we&amp;#39;ve seen this happen for</text>
  <text start="479.049" dur="6.54">a very long time Trump decided with the</text>
  <text start="483.009" dur="7.11">executive order one three eight one</text>

  <text start="508.029" dur="6.961">security should be allowed to happen in</text>
  <text start="511.899" dur="6.031">the United States now the United States</text>
  <text start="514.99" dur="5.19">and Australia they formalized their</text>

  <text start="524.589" dur="6.031">mineral capacity for both countries and</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="4.419">like we said before Trump of the</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="3.649">Patriots they&amp;#39;re setting up these trade</text>
  <text start="532.269" dur="5.521">deals they&amp;#39;re setting up this entire</text>

  <text start="546.97" dur="5.609">bring back all the manufacturing all at</text>
  <text start="548.889" dur="5.041">once this would give them some time but</text>
  <text start="552.579" dur="5.581">it would allow them to compete</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="8.19">with China bringing back the rare earth</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="6.69">processing remember China produced 97%</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="6.33">of the world supply of these important</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="5.609">minerals now the United States is going</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="5.31">to do this once again which is going to</text>
  <text start="570.459" dur="6.121">what compete against China against the</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="4.71">globalist plan this is what Trump of the</text>
  <text start="576.58" dur="3.6">Patriots have been doing and remember</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="3.929">this is not about a four-year election</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="4.92">this is not about an eight-year election</text>
  <text start="582.399" dur="5.94">this is about transitioning from a</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="9.12">globalist system a central bank back</text>
  <text start="588.339" dur="8.611">system into a people system and when we</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.09">do this we&amp;#39;re going to see an economy</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="5.07">that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="604.779" dur="3.75">world think about what is happening</text>
  <text start="607.089" dur="4.171">right now think about the UK for</text>
  <text start="608.529" dur="5.041">instance once Boris Johnson pushes</text>
  <text start="611.26" dur="5.25">through the brexit the United States</text>
  <text start="613.57" dur="6.78">will make a trade deal with the UK with</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="6.449">Australia with many other countries yes</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="5.31">the UK might go through some bumps in</text>
  <text start="622.959" dur="5.941">the road because remember they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="625.66" dur="6.36">off a system that was designed by the</text>
  <text start="628.9" dur="5.58">central bank by the globalists now they</text>
  <text start="632.02" dur="5.58">have to reset that system and yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="634.48" dur="4.859">going to be a little bit bumpy but Trump</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="3.15">and Boris Johnson they&amp;#39;ve been speaking</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re gonna make an interim trade deal</text>
  <text start="640.75" dur="5.64">to help them through these times</text>
  <text start="642.7" dur="5.07">once everything is ironed out and once</text>
  <text start="646.39" dur="2.55">they get through this little bumpy time</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="2.819">and of course we know the central</text>

  <text start="650.589" dur="3.601">gonna say see look what&amp;#39;s happening but</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="4.95">once they get through this small little</text>
  <text start="654.19" dur="5.37">period and other countries start to</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="4.56">trade with the UK and other countries</text>
