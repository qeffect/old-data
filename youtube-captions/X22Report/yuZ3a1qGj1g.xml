  <text start="265.19" dur="8.479">itself the system is doomed they know it</text>

  <text start="277.07" dur="9.63">big-box retailers they&amp;#39;re all slowing</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="7.86">right now it doesn&amp;#39;t look good and as we</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="2.85">move forward and we go throughout the</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="3.959">rest of this year it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="5.52">worse the holiday season is going to be</text>

  <text start="295.07" dur="2.88">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="2.34">telling</text>
  <text start="297.95" dur="3.51">oh look at the store they&amp;#39;re hiring this</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="2.85">many people look at that store they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="3.84">hiring this many people these are</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="6">part-time positions and that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.49">mean that there&amp;#39;s going to be sales all</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re doing is hiring people gearing</text>
  <text start="310.79" dur="4.53">up for this just like they order a lot</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="4.38">of inventory to gear up for the holiday</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="4.32">season and what happened last year is</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.71">going to happen this year but it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="6.3">to be worse there weren&amp;#39;t hardly any</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="6.33">sales they let people go early from the</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="5.19">part-time work they had a lot of</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="6.42">inventory leftover stores started to</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="6.42">close we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="5.85">but it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse every</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="6.72">holiday if you notice that every holiday</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="6.15">season it continually declines it</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="4.41">doesn&amp;#39;t improve it declines more and</text>
  <text start="346.7" dur="3.87">more people are being laid off more more</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="4.02">people don&amp;#39;t have the funds to purchase</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="5.04">the gifts go around your neighborhood</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="4.86">look at the garbages you&amp;#39;ll see garbages</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="4.74">are getting smaller and smaller during</text>
  <text start="357.56" dur="5.37">the holiday season there was one time</text>
  <text start="360.35" dur="4.02">where there were so many boxes and bags</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="5.16">and stuff they couldn&amp;#39;t even be in the</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="6.66">garbage cans last holiday season didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="8.22">even see that all the garbage fit into</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="11.04">the cans people aren&amp;#39;t buying as much we</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="8.82">see the u.s. well they&amp;#39;re importing a</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="6.57">record amount of gold from Switzerland</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="6.09">and when we look at July numbers we see</text>
  <text start="388.64" dur="4.11">that these numbers are up normally the</text>
  <text start="391.22" dur="5.13">flow of gold from the United States has</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="6.75">been heading towards Switzerland the</text>
  <text start="396.35" dur="5.97">u.s. exported a record 691 metric tons</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="7.59">of gold in 2013 but something has</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="7.74">changed us now is importing a record of</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="8.81">23.8 metric tons of gold from</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="9.36">switzerland in july so u.s. gold imports</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="9.27">from Switzerland they&amp;#39;re up eighty-two</text>
  <text start="419.42" dur="8.84">percent already this year in 2016</text>
  <text start="425.17" dur="6.64">Switzerland gold exports to the US</text>
  <text start="428.26" dur="8.58">they&amp;#39;re already at 60 metric tons</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="7.32">up more than 18 times the volume in 2015</text>
  <text start="436.84" dur="5.44">hmm i wonder what the US government</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="6.6">central bankers figured out we better</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="6.51">get gold we know Russia&amp;#39;s been doing it</text>
  <text start="445.73" dur="4.56">we know China has been doing it and it</text>
  <text start="448.79" dur="2.61">looks like the US government central</text>
  <text start="450.29" dur="4.01">bankers are a little late to the game</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="7.769">here and we see things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="9.19">falling apart and gold is the insurance</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="8.491">policy for what is about to happen now</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="7.47">we mentioned think was last week where</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="6.36">the US dollar staged its second</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="6.45">strongest day of the year the last time</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="6.42">it did this was for the brexit right</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="7.91">before the brexit all of a sudden the US</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="8.24">dollar surged we&amp;#39;re seeing it once again</text>
  <text start="485.32" dur="6.06">now something big is about to happen</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="5.14">something big in the financial system</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="5.65">most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be a banking</text>
  <text start="493.82" dur="5.13">crisis in the EU and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="497.03" dur="5.699">signal the clear signal for all of this</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="6.66">is coming from Deutsche Bank and it</text>
  <text start="502.729" dur="6.631">looks like Deutsche Bank is taking an</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="5.16">old nose dive right now we see Deutsche</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="4.229">Bank shares they&amp;#39;re down by sixteen</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="6.319">percent since September 15th nearly</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="6.711">twenty percent from sep tember ninth and</text>
  <text start="517.089" dur="7.151">if you put it a completely different way</text>
  <text start="520.3" dur="8.34">the bank has lost a fifth of its market</text>
  <text start="524.24" dur="7.08">cap in less than two weeks so right now</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="5.98">Deutsche Bank is starting to look like</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="4.98">Lehman and when Deutsche Bank goes we</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="3.54">know they have a very large derivative</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="4.11">book we know the German government is</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="4.77">already out there saying we will bail</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="7.04">out Deutsche Bank we will not let it</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="7.86">fail and we can see the situation is</text>
  <text start="547.45" dur="6.16">getting much much worse because once</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="5.549">this Bank starts to fail there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="5.94">to be a chain reaction and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.339" dur="7.201">going to hit other banks this is why</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="6.149">they created the bell in documents they</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="4.169">didn&amp;#39;t do it just to do it</text>
  <text start="565.699" dur="5.12">they knew what was about to happen they</text>
  <text start="567.709" dur="6.96">knew this system was going to eventually</text>
  <text start="570.819" dur="6.79">collapse on itself either by a black</text>
  <text start="574.669" dur="5.431">swan or they had they were going to have</text>
  <text start="577.609" dur="4.861">the ability to do it themselves and have</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="3.81">a complete story of why it had happened</text>
  <text start="582.47" dur="4.829">and they&amp;#39;ll blame it on another group</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="4.979">country or the people but they knew</text>
  <text start="587.299" dur="2.97">eventually that this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="588.889" dur="5.401">this is why they created the balance</text>
  <text start="590.269" dur="5.16">system because they knew the US and the</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="3.739">other countries they said no more</text>
  <text start="595.429" dur="4.89">balance we&amp;#39;re not doing this anymore and</text>
  <text start="598.029" dur="4.9">they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready for this in</text>
  <text start="600.319" dur="6.841">Saudi Arabia we know their economy is</text>
  <text start="602.929" dur="7.71">tanking and Saudi Arabia right now has</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="8.219">announced a 5.3 billion bailout of its</text>
  <text start="610.639" dur="7.47">banking system so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="615.379" dur="5.43">Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s inter banking borrowing</text>
  <text start="618.109" dur="6.241">rates are nearing the highest since</text>
  <text start="620.809" dur="6.21">Lehman and of course the central bank is</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="6.75">calling it supportive monetary policy on</text>
  <text start="627.019" dur="7.53">behalf of government entities well this</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="6.75">is a bailout many of the countries</text>
  <text start="634.549" dur="5.671">cannot do bailouts anymore they only can</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="5.31">do bail ins and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="640.22" dur="7.709">that we are approaching that time where</text>
  <text start="643.16" dur="7.139">this economy is collapsing rapidly we</text>
  <text start="647.929" dur="6.63">already know we&amp;#39;re in a recession we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="650.299" dur="7.5">on the cusp of a depression and we can</text>
  <text start="654.559" dur="8.97">see that the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.799" dur="9.26">holding this together with illusions</text>
  <text start="663.529" dur="7.381">with pumping up the stock market</text>
  <text start="667.059" dur="5.65">suppressing precious metals trying to</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="4.919">keep the people in the dark of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="672.709" dur="6.09">really happening and they&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="675.829" dur="5.16">nervous about the system ripping itself</text>
  <text start="678.799" dur="3.69">apart before they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="680.989" dur="3.21">bring it down themselves because this is</text>
  <text start="682.489" dur="5.37">really what they want to do they want</text>
  <text start="684.199" dur="6.87">the system to crash but they need a</text>
  <text start="687.859" dur="7.8">story they need to tell the story of why</text>
  <text start="691.069" dur="7.131">it has crashed so when we watch this and</text>
  <text start="695.659" dur="4.341">when we watch what&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="698.2" dur="3.99">see that things are rapidly falling</text>

  <text start="710.38" dur="4.56">they might patch it they might shove</text>
  <text start="712.72" dur="4.35">some money into the bank but eventually</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="5.37">what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="5.28">continually rip itself apart and they</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="4.68">will not be able to stop it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
