  <text start="57.12" dur="5.73">18th 2017 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="60" dur="6.69">is is the Fed actually paying the banks</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="6.42">not to lend let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.69" dur="5.19">collapse financial news now we can see</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="4.68">the market is absolutely crazy one day</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s up a hundred and something points</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="3.51">and then it&amp;#39;s down 100 something points</text>
  <text start="75.69" dur="2.91">and it looks like the markets really not</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="4.38">going anywhere it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="5.64">fluctuating but what we do see happening</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="4.29">is that the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.86">the establishment they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.37">little nervous because when gold starts</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="5.689">to rise what do they do when it reaches</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="6.63">a certain point they slam it down and</text>
  <text start="94.789" dur="7.241">someone decided this morning this was a</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="6.09">great time to dump over 22 thousand gold</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.979">futures contracts which was almost about</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="7.349">three billion notional and it brought</text>
  <text start="107.009" dur="7.441">gold down it was a quick plunge now of</text>
  <text start="111.569" dur="5.521">course is this going to last no because</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="4.44">as we seem in the past once the gold was</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="5.19">slammed down Gold starts moving up again</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="5.1">now this is a signal that we need to be</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.32">looking at this is an indicator that</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="5.219">tells us well things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="6.15">changing now every time they slam gold</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="6.331">down and it pops back up we need to see</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="5.22">how much it goes up because I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="4.86">talking about $5 or $10 or anything like</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.89">that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s meaningless when they</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="6.78">slam gold down and they bring it down</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.21">maybe 20 bucks and gold moves up 50 or a</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="5.339">hundred and they try to slam it down</text>
  <text start="149.07" dur="6.33">again by another 25 bucks and it goes up</text>
  <text start="152.519" dur="4.53">another hundred this is an indicator</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="4.98">that things are starting to change</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="5.371">rapidly and this is what you need to</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="4.68">look at as we move forward because this</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="4.129">will give you some idea what is going on</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="4.29">now if you see gold move up 10 bucks</text>
  <text start="166.549" dur="5.321">from when it was slammed down not really</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.56">that much of a change you will know</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="3.48">right off the bat when things start to</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="4.71">change because they will slam it down</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="5.849">and every time they try to slam it down</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="3.42">it will not work because every time they</text>
  <text start="181.199" dur="3.001">slam it down</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="5.1">it goes up a hundred or fifty or a</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="6.119">hundred and fifty and the bigger and and</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="5.76">the larger increase of gold you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="190.319" dur="5.071">realize that well things are starting to</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="5.039">rapidly fall apart and in the economy</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="3.54">right now we are seeing things rapidly</text>
  <text start="197.939" dur="3.451">falling apart</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="4.08">now remember back a couple reports ago I</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="3.87">told you the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="4.5">gonna start giving us some indication of</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="3.75">when this collapse is going to occur</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re gonna start admitting that</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s problems in the economy and</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re already seeing from corporate</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.56">media that they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="4.89">American retailer and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="3.66">closing thousands of stores and how</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt at a rate not</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="5.25">seen since the recession now that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="223.859" dur="4.591">interesting because just a couple months</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="3.12">ago even a year ago they were saying</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="3.27">that this all had to do with the weather</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="4.86">or online sales</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="5.659">now they&amp;#39;re saying thousands of workers</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re losing their jobs in a</text>
  <text start="237.379" dur="5.021">slow-rolling</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="8.31">crisis and this is devastating the US</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="7.41">economy they&amp;#39;ve already started to let</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="6.3">you know that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="5.549">changing remember they need to show you</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="4.741">that it&amp;#39;s falling apart they can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="5.49">just do this over you know one day or</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="5.789">two days they need to show this as time</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="5.82">moves forward because they will be able</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="5.281">to blame this on Trump because who else</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="4.891">are you gonna blame Obama he handed off</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="4.05">a healthy economy to Trump so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.169">not gonna go and say oh look what Obama</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="5.07">did he they he handed off an economy</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="4.261">that was not functional no but we know</text>
  <text start="278.25" dur="4.979">it wasn&amp;#39;t functional because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="6.09">following it all along now mark Cohen</text>
  <text start="283.229" dur="5.341">from Business Insider he is the director</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.95">of retail studies at Columbia Business</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="4.65">School and he&amp;#39;s saying that the people</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="4.8">that work in retail stores will lose</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="4.74">their jobs then spend less money in</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="5.309">retail stores because they no longer are</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="6.42">employed this creates a cascade of</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="6.27">economic challenges really haven&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="6.089">been saying this all along yes we have</text>
  <text start="307.409" dur="6.451">but what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="310.469" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re already starting the propaganda</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="4.939">that it&amp;#39;s just happened</text>
  <text start="315.719" dur="6.45">now this has been happening all along</text>
  <text start="318.799" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re getting paid prepared for when</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="4.97">this economy comes down that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re doing right now we see the</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="5.29">restaurant industry the restaurant</text>
  <text start="329.939" dur="4.77">industry has suffered the worst collapse</text>
  <text start="332.429" dur="4.56">since 2009 now we talked about this</text>
  <text start="334.709" dur="4.83">before and now they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="336.989" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re saying yes traffic is drying up</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="5.49">in restaurants and it&amp;#39;s going to be get</text>
  <text start="342.809" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="345.029" dur="5.581">so they&amp;#39;re already preparing all of this</text>
  <text start="347.61" dur="6.449">because we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="7.409">we know that the real hard economic data</text>
  <text start="354.059" dur="6.81">it doesn&amp;#39;t fit just like back prior to</text>
  <text start="358.019" dur="4.23">2008 the subprime securities where the</text>
  <text start="360.869" dur="2.94">individuals looked at the subprime</text>
  <text start="362.249" dur="4.02">securities and said well whoa wait a</text>
  <text start="363.809" dur="5.19">minute there&amp;#39;s something wrong here most</text>
  <text start="366.269" dur="4.8">of these loans are in default and these</text>
  <text start="368.999" dur="2.7">are rated triple-a there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="371.069" dur="3.03">wrong here</text>
  <text start="371.699" dur="4.89">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been doing so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="4.71">not a surprise and for you savvy</text>
  <text start="376.589" dur="5.67">investors you will know how to make</text>
  <text start="378.809" dur="5.28">money off of this as the economy crashes</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="3.69">because remember you can make money go</text>
  <text start="384.089" dur="3.51">on when the economy is doing well and</text>
  <text start="385.949" dur="5.19">you can make money as it comes down</text>
  <text start="387.599" dur="8.25">those people are holding gold silver</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="8.19">land most likely you&amp;#39;ll be safe now this</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="6.27">is my opinion I own gold and silver I</text>
  <text start="399.329" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t own land this is my insurance</text>
  <text start="402.119" dur="5.04">policy from things go south I also keep</text>
  <text start="405.059" dur="4.86">cash on hand because in the beginning</text>
  <text start="407.159" dur="4.47">phases you&amp;#39;re going to need the cash to</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="3.45">work with certain individuals now</text>
  <text start="411.629" dur="5.07">remember we&amp;#39;re most likely going to see</text>
  <text start="413.369" dur="5.67">inflation so the value of the currency</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="4.23">is going to decrease and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="3.81">need a lot more dollars to pay for those</text>
  <text start="420.929" dur="4.02">goods until eventually what will happen</text>
  <text start="422.849" dur="4.02">is you&amp;#39;ll no longer use the paper</text>
  <text start="424.949" dur="3.45">currency because people will say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.869" dur="3.87">not even worth it we saw this in many</text>
  <text start="428.399" dur="5.61">other countries and people were bringing</text>
  <text start="430.739" dur="5.34">will barrels of cash to try to purchase</text>
  <text start="434.009" dur="4.65">the goods other people were using the</text>
  <text start="436.079" dur="4.11">cash to heat their homes but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="438.659" dur="3.3">interesting about this and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="440.189" dur="4.32">talking about the pension problem and</text>
  <text start="441.959" dur="4.98">this is going to be a huge problem now a</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="5.051">recent study from the pensions and</text>
  <text start="446.939" dur="5.351">investment group points out the</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="6.66">that top 100 corporate pensions were</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="6.93">underfunded by 250 billion at the end of</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="6.81">2016 now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="7.949">this is despite that 250 percent S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="7.17">rally from 2009 lows to the present time</text>
  <text start="467.169" dur="5.911">corporate pensions have only managed to</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="5.43">improve their funded status from seventy</text>
  <text start="473.08" dur="5.37">nine point one percent in 2008 to eighty</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="6.24">four point five percent today I mean</text>
  <text start="478.45" dur="5.279">that is nothing and basically the</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="5.07">corporate pension funding levels are</text>
  <text start="483.729" dur="5.431">roughly the same as they were in 2008</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="4.68">now the bottom ten corporate pension</text>
  <text start="489.16" dur="5.069">funds alone as ranked by a funded</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="6.84">percentage were underfunded by nearly</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="7.351">seventy billion dollars so this is going</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="6.3">to be a major problem moving forward and</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s the big corporate pensions it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="5.49">state pensions it&amp;#39;s the federal pensions</text>
  <text start="507.25" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re in trouble and just like the</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="3.839">subprime security where those were in</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="4.949">trouble but no one really knew about it</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="5.491">until the disaster hit the same thing is</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="3.661">going to happen with pensions no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="4.38">going to realize it until the very end</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="5.01">now it looks like the real estate market</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="5.97">well it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="526.27" dur="6.6">quickly now in other years 2016 2015</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="5.31">2014 during the spring and summer months</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="4.08">real estate was supposed to pop because</text>

  <text start="662.12" dur="7.05">up this recession started last year but</text>
  <text start="665.96" dur="4.8">again the Fed the US government they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="4.11">only tell you when the recession started</text>
  <text start="670.76" dur="4.44">once we are in the recession and then</text>
  <text start="673.28" dur="5.19">they go back in time just like they did</text>
  <text start="675.2" dur="5.61">with 2008-2009 they didn&amp;#39;t tell you much</text>
  <text start="678.47" dur="4.8">much later that yet by the way and the</text>
  <text start="680.81" dur="4.67">recession started back in 2008 in the</text>
  <text start="683.27" dur="5.19">beginning of 2008 when the Fed was</text>
  <text start="685.48" dur="7.96">forecasting no recession anytime soon</text>
  <text start="688.46" dur="8.13">now City has this index called the macro</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="5.88">surprise index and it has plunged to</text>
  <text start="696.59" dur="6.15">five-month lows with its biggest drop</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="6.81">since 2010 now the Citigroup economic</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="5.45">surprise index and this is a gauge by</text>
  <text start="706.13" dur="4.68">city and designed to track how well</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="5.89">economic data is doing in comparison</text>
  <text start="710.81" dur="6.18">with economic expectations and from this</text>
  <text start="714.08" dur="3.299">it is showing us that well the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.99" dur="3.059">not do</text>
  <text start="717.379" dur="5.55">that well because it is dropped quite</text>
  <text start="720.049" dur="6.06">hard the question is what happens next</text>
  <text start="722.929" dur="6.3">in the stock market because this is not</text>
  <text start="726.109" dur="5.79">a good sign at all now we know the Fed</text>
  <text start="729.229" dur="4.17">has been given bank&amp;#39;s free money they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="731.899" dur="5.31">been pumping it into the stock market</text>
  <text start="733.399" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;ve been told not to lend out yes do</text>
  <text start="737.209" dur="3.42">they still lend yes they do but they</text>
  <text start="739.249" dur="4.02">want to make sure that all that free</text>
  <text start="740.629" dur="5.22">money is not hitting the public because</text>
  <text start="743.269" dur="7.02">we would see inflation so they keep that</text>
  <text start="745.849" dur="5.76">back and on October 3rd 2008 section 120</text>
  <text start="750.289" dur="5.04">of the emergency economic stabilization</text>
  <text start="751.609" dur="6.09">Act of 2008 this allowed the Federal</text>
  <text start="755.329" dur="5.73">Reserve Banks to begin paying interest</text>
  <text start="757.699" dur="6.03">on excess reserve balances as well as</text>
  <text start="761.059" dur="5.79">required reserves the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="763.729" dur="5.79">banks began doing so three days later</text>
  <text start="766.849" dur="5.28">after this was passed and as interest</text>
  <text start="769.519" dur="6.63">rates have risen so has the free money</text>
  <text start="772.129" dur="6.78">to banks and basically the banks have</text>
  <text start="776.149" dur="5.69">received at one percent twenty two</text>
  <text start="778.909" dur="5.97">billion in free money every year and</text>
  <text start="781.839" dur="7.33">nearly all of it goes to the largest</text>
  <text start="784.879" dur="8.55">banks so the question is are they paying</text>
  <text start="789.169" dur="6.81">the banks every single year not to lend</text>
  <text start="793.429" dur="5.82">because it looks like the banks have</text>
  <text start="795.979" dur="6.81">incentive not to lend and simply collect</text>
  <text start="799.249" dur="5.67">interest on the money so we know that</text>
  <text start="802.789" dur="5.311">the Federal Reserve bought up the toxic</text>
  <text start="804.919" dur="6.181">real estate we know the banks were</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="4.739">instructed to not foreclose on homes let</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="3.659">people live in there to make sure that</text>
  <text start="812.839" dur="3.99">the prices rise in homes because the</text>
  <text start="814.759" dur="4.17">more you keep off the market it creates</text>
  <text start="816.829" dur="4.29">a bubble and then you have foreign</text>
  <text start="818.929" dur="4.171">investors you have investment houses</text>
  <text start="821.119" dur="4.05">hedge funds come in and purchase</text>
  <text start="823.1" dur="4.709">thousands upon thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="825.169" dur="6">of homes if you rent them fine hold on</text>
  <text start="827.809" dur="5.97">to them do not sell this creates bubbles</text>
  <text start="831.169" dur="4.98">in the market and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="833.779" dur="5.88">that it looks like they were instructed</text>
  <text start="836.149" dur="6.21">not to lend out money they received</text>
  <text start="839.659" dur="4.98">twenty two billion each year and they</text>
  <text start="842.359" dur="4.41">just held on to it got the interest on</text>
  <text start="844.639" dur="3.66">it they received twenty two billion the</text>
  <text start="846.769" dur="4.44">next year and they did the same thing</text>
  <text start="848.299" dur="5.611">over and over and over now in the I am</text>
  <text start="851.209" dur="6.031">came out with their global GDP outlook</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="6.63">and every time they come out with these</text>
  <text start="857.24" dur="5.639">numbers cut them in half because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.54" dur="5.279">never right right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="862.879" dur="6.96">that the u.s. is going to grow by 2.3</text>
  <text start="865.819" dur="6.93">percent in 2017 well the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="869.839" dur="5.25">already estimated the GDP for the first</text>
  <text start="872.749" dur="5.851">quarter around one point five point six</text>
  <text start="875.089" dur="4.68">percent that&amp;#39;s way off 2018 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="4.169">saying it&amp;#39;s gonna be around two point</text>
  <text start="879.769" dur="5.01">five percent and we know right now they</text>
  <text start="882.769" dur="3.841">are doing I mean prior years to this I</text>
  <text start="884.779" dur="3.84">should say the IMF came out with numbers</text>
  <text start="886.61" dur="4.38">like three point five percent three</text>
  <text start="888.619" dur="6.181">point eight percent these numbers are</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="4.949">ridiculous they never hit the target but</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="2.819">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="895.939" dur="3.26">everything is fine around the world</text>
  <text start="897.619" dur="4.051">because they&amp;#39;re saying global trade is</text>
  <text start="899.199" dur="3.401">estimated to have grown by 2.2 percent</text>
  <text start="901.67" dur="3.69">in 2016</text>
  <text start="902.6" dur="5.909">and volume terms the lowest pace since</text>
  <text start="905.36" dur="5.639">2009 below the two point four growth</text>
  <text start="908.509" dur="5.221">rate of world GDP and market exchange</text>
  <text start="910.999" dur="6.06">rates so whatever they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="913.73" dur="5.819">right now is that these numbers they</text>
  <text start="917.059" dur="4.56">cannot be hid yes if they manipulate</text>
  <text start="919.549" dur="3.57">them of course they can be hid but it</text>
  <text start="921.619" dur="3.72">looks like the manipulation is getting</text>
  <text start="923.119" dur="3.871">harder and harder to do what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="925.339" dur="3.391">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="926.99" dur="4.469">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="928.73" dur="4.919">fine and we can see from what has been</text>
  <text start="931.459" dur="5.55">going on around the world everything is</text>
  <text start="933.649" dur="5.701">not fine this is why we see chaos this</text>
  <text start="937.009" dur="4.74">is why we see a push in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="939.35" dur="4.26">this is why we see the deep state the</text>
  <text start="941.749" dur="3.93">central bank&amp;#39;s pushing this this is why</text>
  <text start="943.61" dur="5.039">we see the Fed raising the interest</text>
  <text start="945.679" dur="5.16">rates just like they did back in 2006</text>
  <text start="948.649" dur="3.841">seven leading into 2008 and then they</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="4.71">started lowering them they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="5.43">same exact thing because again what did</text>
  <text start="955.549" dur="4.47">Trump say low interest rate they are a</text>
  <text start="957.92" dur="3.629">disaster so the Fed started to raise the</text>
  <text start="960.019" dur="3.63">interest rates Trump said whoa</text>
  <text start="961.549" dur="4.26">raising the interest rates that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="963.649" dur="4.53">be a disaster he turned the tables on</text>
  <text start="965.809" dur="5.37">them and we could see right now the Fed</text>
  <text start="968.179" dur="6.241">would like to control the collapse of</text>
  <text start="971.179" dur="5.491">the economy it&amp;#39;s much better for them to</text>
  <text start="974.42" dur="5.12">control it than have a black swan come</text>
  <text start="976.67" dur="6.029">out of nowhere because this way they can</text>
  <text start="979.54" dur="4.629">create the collapse and blame it on who</text>
  <text start="982.699" dur="2.311">they want this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="984.169" dur="3.36">do</text>
  <text start="985.01" dur="5.639">and we can see that Trump now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="987.529" dur="5.461">maneuvering and playing the game because</text>
  <text start="990.649" dur="5.401">they know the economy cannot last and</text>
  <text start="992.99" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;re pushing for a collapse yes</text>
  <text start="996.05" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="997.699" dur="3.541">doing it for the people that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="999.62" dur="4.649">cause the collapses they didn&amp;#39;t cause</text>
  <text start="1001.24" dur="5.3">the collapse in 1929 they haven&amp;#39;t caused</text>
  <text start="1004.269" dur="5.491">the recessions in all the years</text>
  <text start="1006.54" dur="4.96">afterwards of course they have they are</text>
  <text start="1009.76" dur="3.689">in full control of the system think</text>
  <text start="1011.5" dur="4.529">about it if they just cut the stimulus</text>
  <text start="1013.449" dur="5.281">off right now and they stop everything</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="5.161">what happens to the economy it collapses</text>
  <text start="1018.73" dur="4.26">but they can&amp;#39;t do that because it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1021.19" dur="4.649">noticeable so they have to use other</text>
  <text start="1022.99" dur="5.64">methods to make you think that it</text>
  <text start="1025.839" dur="4.83">happened in another way but we know</text>
  <text start="1028.63" dur="4.74">because we&amp;#39;ve been following them we</text>
