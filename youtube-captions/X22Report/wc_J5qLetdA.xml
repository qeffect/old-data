  <text start="80.34" dur="8.729">happened the UK has not left the EU and</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="7.93">they needed to implement article 50 and</text>
  <text start="89.069" dur="9">we can see that the UK was trying to</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="7.651">have the government say okay let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="98.069" dur="7.071">let&amp;#39;s implement the article 50 and let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="108.869" dur="5.091">government doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability to</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="6.78">do this it has to be put to a vote a</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="8.259">parliamentary vote and get approved to</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="7.231">trigger article 50 so the UK must hold a</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="5.3">vote in parliament before starting the</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="5.42">two year countdown to breaks it and</text>
  <text start="127.519" dur="4.81">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this goes i know</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="5.08">people are out there saying it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="132.329" dur="5.011">victory but not yet because the</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="7.26">parliament still has to vote the</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="8.25">parliament has to approve the article 50</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="6.179">trigger and if the Parliament doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="6.35">approve this and if you know the EU</text>
  <text start="148.859" dur="8.69">other governments get their hands into</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="9.07">the different government individuals and</text>
  <text start="157.549" dur="6.851">persuade them to vote in a different way</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.949">this will never happen so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="6.899">have to watch this very carefully and</text>
  <text start="165.959" dur="7.141">see what happens out in the UK now we</text>
  <text start="171.299" dur="5.97">talked a lot about gun control and we</text>
  <text start="173.1" dur="7.53">understand now why the US government the</text>
  <text start="177.269" dur="4.121">central banks want to control the flow</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="1.78">of weapons here</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="2.52">in the United States even though the</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="4.89">United States is the biggest arms dealer</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="6.03">and they supply millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="4.29">weapons around the world they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="6.69">to keep the people from having weapons</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="6.869">and they usually use tricks to convince</text>
  <text start="196.63" dur="4.62">people that we need to do this of course</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="5.311">we know of the false flags where they</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="4.8">have these patsies and they use these</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="4.65">events to convince people that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.05" dur="5.37">mass shootings everywhere and if you</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="7.92">notice they increased dramatically under</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="8.039">Obama&amp;#39;s rain which is kind of suspicious</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.52">in itself but advocates of gun control</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="6.961">they employ several different sleight of</text>
  <text start="221.86" dur="8.51">hand rhetorical tricks number one they</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="7.86">always say that crime is increasing and</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="7.69">they keep repeating the same thing that</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="7.29">yes crime is rising homicide is rising</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="6.41">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and it all sounds</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="6.09">good on the surface but in reality</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="6.609">homicide rates the United States in 2014</text>
  <text start="247.66" dur="6.109">were at a 51 year low they increased</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="8.611">from 2014 to 2015 but remain near a</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="8.741">50-year low and near 1950s levels which</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="5.46">are recognized as an especially unha</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="7.59">model period in the United States now</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="8.18">for for them to make a case that crime</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="6.3">is increasing homicides is increasing</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="6.85">everything&amp;#39;s getting worse what they do</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="6.54">is they take a short term period often</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="4.23">one year to create the impression that</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="6.12">there is an established trend of</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="8.19">increasing crime number two they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="7.35">saying that we have the worst homicide</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="7.819">rate crime rate in the developed world</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="7.759">and of course you need to define</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="6.281">developed what does that really mean and</text>
  <text start="304.169" dur="5.321">when we look at different countries like</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="6.54">for example Chile Argentina Uruguay</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="5.19">Costa Rica Mexico are those developed</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="2.82">nations</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="6.54">well they have a functioning legal</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="7.079">system they&amp;#39;re at peace but we can see</text>
  <text start="321.22" dur="6.9">right now that they exclude those</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="6.981">countries and we see why because they</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="5.519">don&amp;#39;t want to include those countries in</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="6.25">the count because it wouldn&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="5.28">look like the America was worse off than</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="5.91">every other developed country it</text>
  <text start="338.919" dur="7.011">wouldn&amp;#39;t support their narrative and we</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="8.91">can see right now that they also use</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="8.859">suicide and homicide for their third way</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="6.21">of tricking the public now many people</text>
  <text start="354.789" dur="5.25">say it&amp;#39;s the same but really it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="5.97">little different and when we look at</text>
  <text start="360.039" dur="6.151">this we can see that they created a</text>
  <text start="363.37" dur="4.95">category called gun violence which</text>
  <text start="366.19" dur="4.59">sounds like what normal people call</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="6.689">crime but in reality it&amp;#39;s a crime mixed</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="6.75">with suicide and homicide and what they</text>
  <text start="375.009" dur="4.681">do is they use this tactic to push up</text>
  <text start="377.53" dur="4.859">gun violence numbers by including</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="4.02">suicides that&amp;#39;s vastly increasing the</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="4.441">total number of deaths that result from</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="8.55">gun usage and this is how they make</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="9.93">their case number four gun homicide</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="6.24">verse homicide is another trick where</text>
  <text start="396.76" dur="4.14">they manipulate language to high crucial</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="4.919">information when making comparisons</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="4.41">among us states and various countries</text>
  <text start="403.419" dur="5.101">gun control advocates often replace the</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.44">term homicide with gun homicide this is</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="2.73">done because the United States has a</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="4.949">larger share of homicides committed by</text>
  <text start="411.25" dur="5.58">firearms than other countries however it</text>
  <text start="414.699" dur="4.621">can be shown that some countries with</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="4.95">more gun ownership have lower homicide</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="4.71">rates than countries with higher gun</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="4.949">ownership rates for example in</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="4.62">Switzerland gun ownership is common</text>
  <text start="426.729" dur="4.861">forty-eight percent of homicides are</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="5.699">committed with firearms in neighboring</text>
  <text start="431.59" dur="5.94">Germany and Austria the use of firearms</text>
  <text start="434.349" dur="5.521">in homicides as much lower twenty four</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="5.16">percent and ten percent however the</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="6.95">homicide rate is slightly lower in</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="5.279">Switzerland point six per 100,000</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="2.529">compared to</text>
  <text start="447.969" dur="5.4">Germany and Austria which is 0 point</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="7.29">nine and point eight per 100,000 the</text>
  <text start="453.369" dur="6.12">fifth way is they rely on nationwide</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="5.16">statistics and as we know the United</text>
  <text start="459.489" dur="4.53">States is much larger than many of the</text>
  <text start="461.799" dur="4.13">European countries and contains far</text>
  <text start="464.019" dur="5.43">greater variations in terms of geography</text>
  <text start="465.929" dur="5.82">climate culture ethnicity than any</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="4.89">European country outside of Russia</text>
  <text start="471.749" dur="4.63">however this does not stop many of them</text>
  <text start="474.339" dur="4.8">from comparing the United States with</text>
  <text start="476.379" dur="5.94">320 million people to say Belgium which</text>
  <text start="479.139" dur="6.63">only has 11 million people and just a</text>
  <text start="482.319" dur="5.37">handful of metropolitan areas which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.769" dur="3.75">very hard to compare and what you would</text>
  <text start="487.689" dur="4.62">have to do is take one of the states</text>
  <text start="489.519" dur="5.7">with the same population and compared to</text>
  <text start="492.309" dur="5.13">that country but they don&amp;#39;t do that they</text>
  <text start="495.219" dur="3.93">take the entire United States and they</text>
  <text start="497.439" dur="3">compared to that one little country</text>
  <text start="499.149" dur="4.14">where one of those little countries is</text>
  <text start="500.439" dur="4.86">the same as size as one of our states so</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="4.77">they use many different tricks to</text>
  <text start="505.299" dur="7.561">convince this but this is all part of a</text>
  <text start="508.059" dur="6.871">system a part of an agenda to convince</text>
  <text start="512.86" dur="5.579">the American public to convince the</text>
  <text start="514.93" dur="6.75">young that we should not own a weapon</text>
  <text start="518.439" dur="5.01">and we know why at this point because</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about the people</text>
  <text start="523.449" dur="4.711">owning weapons and we can see why now</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="4.14">with the elections coming up because</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="4.89">what happens when the people say you</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="4.769">know something we don&amp;#39;t want to go with</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="6.24">the status quo anymore we want to change</text>
  <text start="535.629" dur="6.781">we don&amp;#39;t want the same old same old well</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="5.01">do you really think those in power are</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="5.219">just going to say you know what fine</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="6.05">take it we don&amp;#39;t want it anymore bring</text>
  <text start="547.629" dur="5.491">in your candidate bring in your outsider</text>
  <text start="550.35" dur="5.14">know what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="7.259">going to use manipulation they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="7.62">to create the narrative that the person</text>
  <text start="560.379" dur="4.32">they want is winning and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="3.839">to do whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="564.699" dur="5.341">the outsider out they&amp;#39;re just not going</text>
  <text start="566.949" dur="6.031">to give up their power I mean I know we</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="5.039">have the elections coming up and I know</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="5.039">there&amp;#39;s this huge scandal with the</text>
  <text start="575.079" dur="4.68">emails where there&amp;#39;s more and more of</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="3.301">these emails coming out the FBI is</text>
  <text start="579.759" dur="2.881">looking into it many</text>
  <text start="581.32" dur="4.08">people have different theories of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.64" dur="4.71">going on but we have to look past that a</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="7.83">little bit and look at what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="10.08">happening here the insiders are going to</text>
  <text start="593.23" dur="8.06">keep the outsiders out they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="7.59">them in here and when they get in there</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="6.34">they take care of it so what do they do</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="6.6">to keep the outsider out they manipulate</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="6.39">they lie they cheat and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="5.04">most worried about is the American</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="4.35">people having weapons saying listen we</text>
  <text start="616.66" dur="3.9">know what you&amp;#39;re doing here you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="6.2">manipulating your cheating you&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="6.93">we want you out they don&amp;#39;t leave easily</text>
  <text start="624.57" dur="6.4">they will use force on the American</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="8.46">people they don&amp;#39;t care they believe</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;re above we the people this is how</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="6.63">they see themselves I would personally</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="5.91">be shocked if Trump wins I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="3.84">people are out there who want Trump to</text>
  <text start="644.68" dur="3.78">win I know a lot of people are saying</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="5.64">that he&amp;#39;s in the lead they&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="648.46" dur="7.02">take it by storm but I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="8.28">pass these individuals the shadow</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="11.43">government the elite to manipulate cheat</text>
  <text start="660.34" dur="9.54">and lie to keep their power I would be</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="4.23">shocked I could be wrong but from</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="2.96">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been seeing and</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="5.25">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been looking at I</text>
  <text start="672.84" dur="5.62">would be very surprised now there might</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="5.7">be a situation where they try to</text>
  <text start="678.46" dur="6.84">manipulate and Trump does get in I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="682.09" dur="4.77">know how long he&amp;#39;s going to last they</text>
  <text start="685.3" dur="4.26">might even stop it before it even</text>
  <text start="686.86" dur="5.49">happens this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="689.56" dur="6.48">preparing for all of this think about</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="6.54">what they&amp;#39;ve been saying Obama was out</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="5.55">there saying that you cannot hack into</text>
  <text start="698.89" dur="5.28">the election system there is no voter</text>
  <text start="701.59" dur="3.99">fraud this is what they use as</text>
  <text start="704.17" dur="3.59">propaganda to convince the American</text>
  <text start="705.58" dur="4.62">people after the people that I speak to</text>
  <text start="707.76" dur="5.44">they really do believe there&amp;#39;s no voter</text>
  <text start="710.2" dur="4.83">fraud they really do believe maybe in</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="4.43">one little district but</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="8.43">overall everything else is pretty honest</text>
  <text start="717.63" dur="9.01">and they&amp;#39;ve been hyping up Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="723.46" dur="4.62">cyber attacking Russia releasing the</text>
  <text start="726.64" dur="3.45">emails which we find out today that</text>
  <text start="728.08" dur="5.52">Russia had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="730.09" dur="8.76">release of the emails but they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="8.58">preparing for this by using this type of</text>
  <text start="738.85" dur="6.42">propaganda because when things don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="742.18" dur="5.91">their way again they will lie they will</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="8.1">cheat they will do whatever they have to</text>
  <text start="748.09" dur="6.3">to keep their power now we understand</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="3.03">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="754.39" dur="5.61">central bankers and other countries are</text>
  <text start="756.4" dur="7.29">in Ukraine beefing up their military and</text>
