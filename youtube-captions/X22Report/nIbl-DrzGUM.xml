  <text start="53.22" dur="6.44">hi and welcome you listening to the expo</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="6.23">to report my name is Dave news episode</text>
  <text start="59.66" dur="5.76">1304 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June 12th</text>
  <text start="62.99" dur="4.81">2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.42" dur="5.68">federal and state tax receipts are</text>
  <text start="67.8" dur="5.22">declining rapidly expect a hard landing</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="4.98">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.91">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="4.59">a lot of economic indicators and we</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.2">discussed yesterday about loan creation</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="4.44">and this is something where we need to</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="5.09">look at this very very closely because</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="6.81">this is something that they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="88.22" dur="6.43">manipulate and for the last what fifty</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="5.52">seven years or so it&amp;#39;s been showing us</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="5.52">and it&amp;#39;s been reporting to us that</text>
  <text start="97.44" dur="6.41">either were in a recession when loan</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="7.17">creation completely stops or declines or</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="6.31">the recessions about to happen now there</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.85">are many more indicators that basically</text>
  <text start="110.16" dur="4.14">work with the loan creation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.19" dur="3.09">going to get into that a little bit</text>
  <text start="114.3" dur="3.3">later in this report and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="3.3">see as we put all the pieces together</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;re going to see that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="119.58" dur="4.47">down this path which I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s scary that we&amp;#39;re heading down this</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="4.17">path where things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="125.94" dur="5.75">deteriorating and we need to look at the</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="7.769">economy right now as maybe a drug addict</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="6.88">where during the period where the drug</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="5.101">addict is receiving the high receiving</text>
  <text start="138.57" dur="3.15">the stimulus they feel great everything</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="2.76">looks great</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="5.269">they feel great there&amp;#39;s no problems</text>
  <text start="143.85" dur="5.97">whatsoever and when the drug wears off</text>
  <text start="146.989" dur="5.5">they start going through different signs</text>
  <text start="149.82" dur="4.68">of withdrawal and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="4.861">seeing the economy go through right now</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="5.1">the stimulus that has been pumping this</text>
  <text start="157.35" dur="5.699">economy up it&amp;#39;s wearing off and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="4.65">seeing signs of withdrawal and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.049" dur="3.901">getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="4.53">as time goes on and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="4.86">that it&amp;#39;s not just here in the United</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="5.09">States but it&amp;#39;s around the world and the</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="4.77">central bankers the deep state</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="4.36">organization they know this they know</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s going on they know what&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="4.5">to happen and they can slow it down they</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="4.38">can speed it up they have full control</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.38">of the system the only thing they really</text>
  <text start="185.16" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t have control of is something</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="4.89">comes out of left field and if something</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.96">does come out of left field well they</text>
  <text start="192" dur="2.52">can either go with it or they could try</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="3.51">to stop it</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="4.29">but most of the time once that starts</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="3.27">happening and people see what that</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="5.16">happening the whole system starts to</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="5.49">fall apart now out in Spain we see that</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="3.39">the banks that well they&amp;#39;re really in a</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="4.05">lot of trouble right now they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="5.82">bailed in right now there&amp;#39;s other banks</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.95">that are not looking good and we can see</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="4.44">the Spanish securities regulators well</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="4.65">they know there&amp;#39;s a problem because what</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve done already is they decided to</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="5.79">ban something and they banned the sale</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="5.01">of borrowed shares for a month now</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re saying that market confidence</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="5.42">has deteriorated in relations to a part</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="5.52">of the local banking sector and the band</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="6.58">prohibits investors from starting new</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="8.37">short positions or to adding to existing</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="7.59">ones this tells you that they know these</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.729">banks are coming down they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="5.46">people to short these banking system and</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="4.831">they put a ban they said no you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="4.799">it I&amp;#39;m sorry we know it&amp;#39;s coming down</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="5.34">and you just can&amp;#39;t do any of this and if</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="4.711">you have already position you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="5.64">add to it either so they&amp;#39;re stopping</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="5.79">individuals from doing this now what are</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="4.26">we seeing happen well here in the United</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="4.44">States we know that retail is</text>
  <text start="270.06" dur="5.46">contracting quite a bit the US retail</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="5.25">sector well there are more and more</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="4.56">stores that are going to be declaring</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="4.92">bankruptcy Moody&amp;#39;s is out there and they</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.07">have this whole entire list of all these</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="5.46">different stores and they keep upping</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="4.829">the list now they started at 19 or</text>
  <text start="288.18" dur="4.44">actually they started at 15 they brought</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="4.861">it up to 19 now there&amp;#39;s 22 stores and</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="4.65">they might be adding an additional five</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="4.889">to this saying that these are the stores</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="3.69">that are in major trouble and these</text>
  <text start="299.729" dur="2.94">stores are going to be going bankrupt I</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="4.62">think by the end of this year you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.669" dur="4.681">going to see maybe 50 60 maybe even a</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="2.399">hundred stores that are going to go</text>
  <text start="307.35" dur="3.21">bankrupt</text>
  <text start="307.979" dur="4.081">I think this list is conservative right</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="3.24">now I think it&amp;#39;s going to go much much</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="3.39">higher than this because we can see</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="3.72">already the numbers that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="4.08">putting out there they&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="3.3">that well it&amp;#39;s not going to be the eight</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="4.47">thousand stores it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="5.16">maybe 10 next year around 13 I think if</text>
  <text start="324" dur="4.02">this number is going to be even higher</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="4.01">than what they&amp;#39;re saying because what</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="5.02">breakdown of the system we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="4.17">the restaurant industry actually the</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="5.07">chain restaurant they&amp;#39;re already in a</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="4.95">recession their whole system is breaking</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.92">apart because right now they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="6.15">15-month downturn this is the longest</text>
  <text start="345" dur="5.25">since 2009 and there&amp;#39;s no end in sight</text>
  <text start="348.54" dur="3.92">why because people don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="5.16">discretionary income to go out and</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="5.53">purchase this food because there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="5.13">and more people losing their jobs we see</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="5.07">already in the stock market there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="360.54" dur="7.92">tech stock bloodbath we look at Amazon</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="7.83">Apple Google Microsoft all turning down</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="6.69">and we have to remember that these are</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="6.2">the companies that keep the sp500 up if</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.76">all these companies are turning down</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="5.59">well there&amp;#39;s a major problem right now</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="4.81">now yes will they be pumped up once</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="5.52">again most likely remember who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="6.06">purchasing these stocks the central</text>
  <text start="388.2" dur="5.49">bank&amp;#39;s government they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="5.7">who&amp;#39;ve been propping the market up this</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.88">is not a real market this is a complete</text>
  <text start="396.48" dur="5.34">illusion but this is a warning right now</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="3.48">that even though they&amp;#39;re propping the</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="4.11">stocks up and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="403.05" dur="5.55">purchasing there&amp;#39;s major problems here</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.83">now one of the big problems and we</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="5.55">discussed it yesterday is loan creation</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="4.76">that is stalling right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="4.59">starting to decline we saw it in</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="6.67">commercial loans we see it in auto loans</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="5.87">we see it in housing loans and we</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="5.79">understand that the debt continually</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="5.59">increases it&amp;#39;s not going anywhere it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.98" dur="4.23">not going down it&amp;#39;s not stopping it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.2" dur="3.96">continually increasing the government is</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="3.6">continually spending more and more money</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="6.84">which means they have to borrow more</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="6.99">money and they depend on the federal tax</text>
  <text start="441" dur="3.72">receipts to pay for all this they depend</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="4.77">on state tax receipts for the states to</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="4.08">pay for their debt and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="447.57" dur="4.71">right now this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="5.94">Rockefeller Institute and CBO the US</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="6.69">federal income tax receipts has</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="9.57">come in about 3% below expectations this</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="9.36">year we are hovering around zero percent</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="6.24">right now on year to year percentage of</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="4.619">the number of tax receipts coming into</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="7.11">the government we&amp;#39;re heading in a</text>
  <text start="472.949" dur="8.791">downward trend just like we did prior to</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="8.55">2008 going into 2008 now if we look at</text>
  <text start="481.74" dur="8.91">state and local tax receipts they are</text>
  <text start="486.21" dur="6.57">declining at the same rate so we have</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="4.68">problems here now if we look at the</text>
  <text start="492.78" dur="4.74">state and corporate tax receipts for two</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.07">quarters in a row they have been</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="5.91">declining this is the biggest drop since</text>
  <text start="500.4" dur="5.669">the recession and according to the</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="6.69">Rockefeller Institute total state tax</text>
  <text start="506.069" dur="7.231">collections grew only 1.2 percent in the</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.799">year of 2016 which means it declined in</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="4.71">real terms this is the weakest</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="5.581">performance in 2010 now on a federal</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="4.589">level it will impact the amount that</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="4.5">government has to borrow to fund its</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="3.541">deficit therefore determining when the</text>
  <text start="525" dur="3.81">government will hit the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="4.139">this is quite relevant today since the</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="3.899">debt ceiling was officially reached on</text>
  <text start="530.279" dur="4.921">March 17th and of course as we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.709" dur="4.951">been extended using extraordinary</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="4.11">measures it&amp;#39;s basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="3.56">doing is they&amp;#39;re using black pools of</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="4.98">money to keep the government operational</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="4.9">however the weakness in these tax</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="5.13">receipt this is going to create a</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="6.93">challenge which means that the debt</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="6.3">ceiling date might move up which I think</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s going to and these tax receipts</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="4.92">because it&amp;#39;s one of the few unvarnished</text>
  <text start="558.06" dur="4.2">unadjusted realistic data points</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="2.55">regarding the health of the overall</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="3.78">economy</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="4.62">well economists look at this and say the</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="4.5">country is doing well the country is not</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="5.25">doing well and the tax receipts they are</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="6.5">a function of income creation in the</text>
  <text start="573.06" dur="7.8">economy a slowdown in the tax receipts</text>
  <text start="577.04" dur="6.07">indicates a slowing in income creation</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.71">and therefore overall economic</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.86">performance now we knew this was</text>
  <text start="585.57" dur="3.18">happening how do we know this well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="587.97" dur="3.33">been tracking the</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="4.86">market not the fake unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking exactly what has</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="3.51">been happening in the retail sector in</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="4.02">the corporate sector we&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="5.31">data from challenger gray in Christmas</text>
  <text start="599.13" dur="5.55">because remember back in 2013 that</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="5.55">department that counts layoffs</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="4.53">well that department was removed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="3.24">saying they didn&amp;#39;t have the funds to</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="3.9">keep it operational well they did that</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="4.82">on purpose of course so growth in</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="6.57">federal tax receipts these trends are</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="5.5">showing us that people are making less</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="3.51">money people are out of job and the</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="4.41">number of tax receipts coming into the</text>
  <text start="623.19" dur="6.15">government well it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="625.95" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re declining at a ridiculous pace</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="6.72">and this deterioration in federal tax</text>
  <text start="631.98" dur="6.63">receipts is very troubling so we have</text>
  <text start="636.06" dur="5.64">loan creation which is very difficult to</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="5.49">manipulate we have tax receipts very</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="5.07">difficult to manipulate showing us that</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="6.96">we have major problems actually it is</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="7.29">back to where we were back in 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="651.06" dur="6.09">when we&amp;#39;re in this crisis mode of this</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="5.31">Great Recession and again these are the</text>
  <text start="657.15" dur="5.189">withdrawal symptoms of the economy</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.01">coming off of stimulus so now the</text>

  <text start="711.57" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s at negative one very close to</text>
  <text start="713.4" dur="6.63">negative one and this is what happened</text>

  <text start="735.24" dur="7.05">complete disaster what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="737.55" dur="9.12">that we are now down to negative three</text>
  <text start="742.29" dur="9.239">percent credit has gone negative it is</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="6.9">getting worse which means that credit is</text>
  <text start="751.529" dur="6.301">going to freeze up what actually</text>
  <text start="753.57" dur="7.53">happened in 2008 credit froze up if we</text>
  <text start="757.83" dur="8.31">go back to that time period right where</text>
  <text start="761.1" dur="10.53">we were between 2007-2008 we were at</text>
  <text start="766.14" dur="10.68">negative two percent at 2008 we are at</text>
  <text start="771.63" dur="8.72">negative three percent in 2017 and by</text>
  <text start="776.82" dur="6.42">the white people this is a recovery the</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="5.95">economy is recovered with a negative</text>
  <text start="783.24" dur="5.61">three percent credit impulse so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.3" dur="4.59">put all this together tax tax receipts</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="4.58">are declining federal and state</text>
  <text start="790.89" dur="7.16">corporate tax receipts are declining</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="7.899">loan creation is stalled and declining</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="6.55">credit impulse what tells us credits</text>
  <text start="801.329" dur="4.411">freezing up put all of this together we</text>
  <text start="804.6" dur="3.479">have a major problem</text>
  <text start="805.74" dur="5.4">now that credit that&amp;#39;s global credit</text>
  <text start="808.079" dur="6.45">impulse what about the US credit impulse</text>
  <text start="811.14" dur="7.259">well we have the same exact problem the</text>
  <text start="814.529" dur="7.081">US credit impulse is also slowing it is</text>
  <text start="818.399" dur="7.321">just dropped to like negative 0.1</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="8.13">percent and it dropped in the end of</text>
  <text start="825.72" dur="5.78">2007 going into 2008 to negative 0.1</text>
  <text start="829.74" dur="5.58">percent the same thing that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="831.5" dur="7.48">once again we&amp;#39;re in that same exact</text>
  <text start="835.32" dur="6.959">position and it&amp;#39;s showing us that credit</text>
  <text start="838.98" dur="6">is going to freeze up and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="842.279" dur="4.711">be in this collapse scenario forget</text>
  <text start="844.98" dur="4.89">about a recession we&amp;#39;re already in the</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="4.8">recession and what is the Fed going to</text>
  <text start="849.87" dur="3.69">do this week they&amp;#39;re going to look at</text>
  <text start="851.79" dur="4.229">the economy they&amp;#39;re going to have their</text>
  <text start="853.56" dur="3.959">Fed meeting and they&amp;#39;re going to decide</text>
  <text start="856.019" dur="3.18">we raise the rates or should we lower</text>
  <text start="857.519" dur="3.6">the rates or should we keep them the</text>
  <text start="859.199" dur="3.24">same well we know they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="861.119" dur="4.08">lower it that&amp;#39;d be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="862.439" dur="6.27">they can keep it the same yes now I</text>
  <text start="865.199" dur="5.281">think the last rate increase already</text>
  <text start="868.709" dur="4.05">triggered the economy because since that</text>
  <text start="870.48" dur="3.899">period of time until now the economy has</text>
  <text start="872.759" dur="4.02">turned to the downside and it is</text>
  <text start="874.379" dur="4.231">accelerated and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="876.779" dur="4.65">all these economic indicators and it is</text>
  <text start="878.61" dur="5.819">really getting worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="881.429" dur="4.921">so let&amp;#39;s look at both sides here we know</text>
  <text start="884.429" dur="3.9">they have already triggered the economy</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="3.959">and it is collapsing right now now they</text>
  <text start="888.329" dur="3.45">can go ahead and say listen we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="890.309" dur="3.301">going to raise the interest rates we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="891.779" dur="4.261">just going to let the economy slide off</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="4.889">the cliff the way it is and we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="6.239">let it go naturally maybe by the end of</text>
  <text start="898.499" dur="5.07">this year if the Fed decides that</text>
  <text start="902.279" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re going to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="903.569" dur="4.44">rates well look out which means they</text>
  <text start="906.569" dur="6.32">don&amp;#39;t want to wait to the end of this</text>
  <text start="908.009" dur="7.44">year they want it to happen now they are</text>
  <text start="912.889" dur="5.711">worried that there&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="915.449" dur="5.13">type of Black Swan event they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="918.6" dur="4.709">this to happen because they need to</text>
  <text start="920.579" dur="5.7">control the narrative if they raise the</text>
  <text start="923.309" dur="5.46">rates they&amp;#39;re going to accelerate the</text>
  <text start="926.279" dur="5.16">collapse like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before we</text>
  <text start="928.769" dur="4.74">think we&amp;#39;re getting bad data now just</text>
  <text start="931.439" dur="4.231">wait you&amp;#39;re going to see things go</text>
  <text start="933.509" dur="4.11">haywire when they raise rates now of</text>
  <text start="935.67" dur="5.219">course the next day you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="937.619" dur="5.7">see it a month later you will see it two</text>
  <text start="940.889" dur="5.221">months later you will see it and I think</text>
  <text start="943.319" dur="5.281">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is most likely</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="4.349">raise the rates because I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.6" dur="4.079">very worried that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="950.459" dur="4.56">Black Swan and they&amp;#39;re going to lose the</text>
  <text start="952.679" dur="4.14">narrative and I think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="955.019" dur="3.66">raise the rates I mean I could be wrong</text>
  <text start="956.819" dur="3.96">they could just let it play out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.679" dur="4.65">going to crash anyhow if they raise the</text>
  <text start="960.779" dur="4.11">rates we&amp;#39;re going to see an acceleration</text>
  <text start="963.329" dur="5.43">and the collapse of the economy which</text>
  <text start="964.889" dur="7.021">should be a signal to everyone to start</text>
  <text start="968.759" dur="5.88">ramping up your preps because they just</text>
  <text start="971.91" dur="4.739">signaled to you yeah just like they did</text>
  <text start="974.639" dur="4.05">back prior to 2008 when they were</text>
  <text start="976.649" dur="3.78">raising the rates were crashing the</text>
  <text start="978.689" dur="3.96">economy now they didn&amp;#39;t have to do as</text>
  <text start="980.429" dur="4.38">many as they did prior to 2008 because</text>
  <text start="982.649" dur="4.92">this whole economy was been propped up</text>
  <text start="984.809" dur="4.921">on stimulus and it was very easy to</text>
  <text start="987.569" dur="3.691">bring down it&amp;#39;s really not that hard</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="3.33">and of course they&amp;#39;re not going to throw</text>
  <text start="991.26" dur="2.91">the switch in the back room to bring it</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="3.329">down because they need to make it look</text>
  <text start="994.17" dur="5.88">natural and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="996.389" dur="6.601">so we see right now that this is where</text>
  <text start="1000.05" dur="5.43">they are headed if they do this this is</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="4.74">your signal and I would batten down the</text>
  <text start="1005.48" dur="5.01">hatches get prepared this is not to</text>
  <text start="1007.73" dur="4.89">scare everyone I mean if you think about</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="4.77">it for those people who are caught up in</text>
  <text start="1012.62" dur="4.92">2008 if you had all these warnings ahead</text>
  <text start="1015.26" dur="3.54">of time where hey you are looking to buy</text>
  <text start="1017.54" dur="2.88">that house at the height of the market</text>
  <text start="1018.8" dur="3.599">maybe you wouldn&amp;#39;t purchase that house</text>
  <text start="1020.42" dur="3.779">maybe if you were going to sell your</text>
  <text start="1022.399" dur="4.111">house you would have done it maybe two</text>
  <text start="1024.199" dur="4.801">years ahead of time taking the cash</text>
  <text start="1026.51" dur="4.439">maybe put it in gold or silver or put it</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="4.079">into some other type of investment maybe</text>
  <text start="1030.949" dur="3.691">even the stock market just to play it</text>
  <text start="1033.079" dur="5.071">for a little while then take it out and</text>
  <text start="1034.64" dur="5.309">you know make your your wealth or</text>
  <text start="1038.15" dur="3.24">whatever you were going to do but you</text>
  <text start="1039.949" dur="3.36">could see if you had this information</text>
  <text start="1041.39" dur="3.929">you would have been ready and prepping</text>
  <text start="1043.309" dur="3.75">for those people that we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="1045.319" dur="4.591">to stay in their house they would have</text>
  <text start="1047.059" dur="5.101">made preps to say okay I might lose my</text>
  <text start="1049.91" dur="5.67">job I better prepare for what is coming</text>
  <text start="1052.16" dur="6.36">I better have food and just be ready for</text>
  <text start="1055.58" dur="5.07">the entire economy falling apart this</text>
  <text start="1058.52" dur="3.93">time it&amp;#39;s a little different because the</text>
  <text start="1060.65" dur="3.36">stimulus is really not going to work now</text>
  <text start="1062.45" dur="3.81">when the economy comes down will they</text>
  <text start="1064.01" dur="4.23">try stimulus of course they will will it</text>
  <text start="1066.26" dur="5.549">work for a very short period of time</text>
  <text start="1068.24" dur="5.52">maybe but what&amp;#39;s going to eventually</text>
  <text start="1071.809" dur="3.931">happen is the economy is just going to</text>
  <text start="1073.76" dur="4.919">turn down because they already know that</text>
  <text start="1075.74" dur="4.77">the stimulus didn&amp;#39;t work the last time</text>
