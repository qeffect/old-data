  <text start="70.89" dur="5.79">financial news now as we can see and as</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="4.231">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on the retail</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="5.07">industry has been hit very very hard</text>

  <text start="94.34" dur="6.61">27th and we&amp;#39;re looking at a catastrophic</text>
  <text start="98.57" dur="5.29">event that is occurring Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="5.76">right now is firing up to about 500</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="6.36">people and this comes after bonus</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="5.159">payments and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="3.33">these bonus payments they were on the</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="2.851">generous side and they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="4.02">500 people</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="6.259">now what we are seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="5.759">deterioration of the economic system</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="5.35">whereas continually seeing that the</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="6.6">retail industry is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="6.871">very quickly and retail is a very big</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="6.81">part of the GDP number which is about</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="6.03">70% of GDP and this is what people are</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="4.231">going out and spending and and buying</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.74">stuff and this then leads into</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="5.64">manufacturing it leads into deliveries</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="5.16">and it&amp;#39;s all connected and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="4.95">starting to see a major breakdown now</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="4.53">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the central</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.5">bankers and central bankers they have</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="4.14">their own plan they&amp;#39;ve always had their</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="6.42">own plan they were and still are</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="7.44">preparing to move us to a completely</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.98">different system now this system wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="3.81">developed like yesterday this has been</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="5.28">going on for quite a while and it takes</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="4.8">a lot of time to move everything from a</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="3.66">country where they know it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="176.28" dur="4.8">deteriorate where they know their system</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="5.04">is going to implode to someplace else</text>
  <text start="181.08" dur="4.29">and this is why they started a while</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="3.12">back now a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="2.88">recognize it</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="4.11">people thought oh we&amp;#39;re just moving it</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="3.75">over there because it&amp;#39;s cheaper and this</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="3.27">is why we&amp;#39;re coming up with that trade</text>
  <text start="192" dur="5.91">agreement no this was all done on</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="7.71">purpose they knew eventually that their</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="8.78">finance system that they&amp;#39;ve created was</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="9.78">only going to last from 1971 until about</text>
  <text start="206.69" dur="6.76">2018 2019 2020 2020 around this period</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="4.32">then it would not be able to be</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.899">sustained because they knew the value of</text>
  <text start="215.61" dur="3.84">the dollar would decrease the debt</text>
  <text start="217.349" dur="5.821">levels around the world would be so high</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="5.67">that it didn&amp;#39;t matter if each country</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="5.28">paid in they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to pay</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="6.51">this debt then they knew they needed to</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="6.72">bring the interest rates down and this</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="6.96">crisis back in 2008 it looks like they</text>
  <text start="235.17" dur="6.42">needed that crisis too so they could</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="5.22">create their stimulus packages they had</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="3.57">an excuse to bring down the interest</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="3.54">rates because think about it if we</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t have that crisis what would they</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="3.71">do at that point could they say hey</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="5.04">let&amp;#39;s bring down the interest rates now</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="5.41">can we start stimulus no they needed a</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="6.089">crisis that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve done they</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="6.449">created a crisis back then which allowed</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="5.161">them which allowed the governments to</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="5.31">pass certain laws to allow the central</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="5.64">banks to do what they&amp;#39;ve done the</text>
  <text start="268.229" dur="6">problem right now is that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="5.25">worried about the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="3.601">and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize this</text>
  <text start="276.57" dur="2.64">and it&amp;#39;s almost like the internet when</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="2.7">it was first born where people like at</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="3.209">what&amp;#39;s the internet who really cares</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.48">you can go surf it and you can find</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="2.761">things there are search engines actually</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="2.82">they really wasn&amp;#39;t it was just like</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="4.44">Yahoo which was a directory search where</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="5.97">they manually inputted different</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="4.98">websites into their directory but people</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="3.869">didn&amp;#39;t understand what this was going to</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="3.9">be people didn&amp;#39;t understand how big it</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="3.301">was going to be people didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="2.16">that this was going to be used on their</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="3.09">phone</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="4.95">people were gonna shop using the</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="4.109">Internet and they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3.96">almost pretty much everything on the</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="4.291">internet today crypto currencies is</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.23">pretty much the same thing people are</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="8.04">not understanding what this really is</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="6.78">and this is a new currency system this</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="3.87">is a new</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="5.64">see system where it is completely</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="5.64">electronic it is a truth machine where</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="5.1">everything can every transaction can be</text>
  <text start="329.01" dur="6.09">traced and tracked down because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="5.88">built on Ledger&amp;#39;s and all of this can be</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="5.34">done without the central bank without</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="5.13">the banking system and the central</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="3.9">bankers right now they realize that this</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="5.91">is catching on and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="6.36">been demonizing it all along and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="4.56">making it very volatile where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="3.9">buying a lot of Bitcoin they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="4.26">it and they&amp;#39;re trying to make people</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="5.79">think that oh my god you can&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="5.37">this because look how crazy it is but</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s happening is more and more people</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="4.68">are looking at this going maybe I should</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="5.16">get in I mean JPMorgan came out with</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="4.77">their Bible we had the biz the IMF the</text>
  <text start="369.63" dur="4.53">Fed all saying that they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="4.44">push regulations they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="3.99">criminals use it terrorists use it bla</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="6.96">bla bla bla bla and they keep doing this</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="9.27">now we see JPMorgan they were out there</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="7.2">once again and the bank has claimed that</text>
  <text start="387.42" dur="5.76">Bitcoin will not be able to properly</text>
  <text start="390.48" dur="5.19">deal with a liquidity crisis in the</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="4.47">event of an economic shock now this is</text>
  <text start="395.67" dur="3.93">very interesting interesting in there in</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="5.07">this statement because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="5.4">that cryptocurrency would not be able to</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="4.7">do not be able to deal with the next</text>
  <text start="405" dur="5.4">economic shock now first of all</text>
  <text start="407.42" dur="6.85">cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s not the currency as</text>
  <text start="410.4" dur="6.66">of yet and it&amp;#39;s just another commodity</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="5.04">right now like gold silver and</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="3.87">everything else why are they worried</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.41">about this and why are they talking</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="6.21">about an economic shock that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.72" dur="6.27">interesting in itself in the US when</text>
  <text start="427.14" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re saying when such a shocks has</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="5.94">occurred central banks will pump in</text>
  <text start="433.14" dur="5.55">additional cash into the economy to</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="5.94">address declines in lending and spending</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="5.49">in the private sector however such a</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="4.8">liquidity infusion would be close to</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="4.74">impossible with Bitcoin because there is</text>
  <text start="446.67" dur="3.99">no central institution that controls the</text>
  <text start="448.92" dur="4.62">network and the number of coins released</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="3.42">each year is a is fixed at a certain</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="4.349">rate</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="5.94">is coming from JP Morgan now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="457.889" dur="4.411">about what they&amp;#39;re saying here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="7.32">saying when the next economic shock</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="7.35">comes we&amp;#39;ll not be able to create many</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="3.539">coins to put into circulation oh wait</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="3">they don&amp;#39;t put it into circulation</text>
  <text start="470.879" dur="5.04">they prop up the banks they prop up the</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="7.049">stock market so they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="7.8">create these coins to to pump up the</text>
  <text start="479.699" dur="11.19">stock market and the banks okay first of</text>
  <text start="483.719" dur="10.98">all who creates these problems these</text>
  <text start="490.889" dur="7.351">problems are created by the central</text>
  <text start="494.699" dur="6.391">bank&amp;#39;s now they&amp;#39;re saying one of the</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="5.85">benefits of fiat money is that it can be</text>
  <text start="501.09" dur="5.97">used to provide emergency liquidity from</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="5.639">the outside this is the role central</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="5.669">banks play as the lender of last resort</text>
  <text start="509.729" dur="6.12">now JP Morgan is out there trying to</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="6.781">convince the world that if we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="6.211">economic shock Bitcoin will not be able</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="4.62">to do what the central bankers can do</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.589">where they can create a lot of currency</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="5.91">by pushing a button created out of thin</text>
  <text start="526.649" dur="6.93">air and give it to banks pump up the</text>
  <text start="530.04" dur="6.239">stock market never to the public none of</text>
  <text start="533.579" dur="4.591">it ever really reaches the public anyhow</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="4.651">they won&amp;#39;t be able to ship it off to</text>
  <text start="538.17" dur="7.349">other countries and other central banks</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="6.93">and this is all to help the everyday</text>
  <text start="545.519" dur="5.641">person this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="547.86" dur="5.18">convince us of now Bitcoin backers they</text>
  <text start="551.16" dur="4.65">hit back at the claim made by the bank</text>
  <text start="553.04" dur="5.229">arguing that their case is built on the</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.2">assumption that printing money to shore</text>
  <text start="558.269" dur="5.701">up the economy is something that is</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="6.63">beneficial which I agree they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="3.9">a lot of currency was it beneficial to</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="3.689">the people most of the people are</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="4.709">hurting right now most of the people</text>
  <text start="570.329" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t find jobs most of the people are</text>
  <text start="572.579" dur="5.25">making less money now actually the value</text>
  <text start="574.769" dur="4.861">of the dollar has decreased aaron Lasher</text>
  <text start="577.829" dur="4.471">the chief marketing officer at</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="5.519">cryptocurrency tech company bread wallet</text>
  <text start="582.3" dur="4.83">said this is a classic case of creating</text>
  <text start="585.149" dur="2.801">the problem you offered to solve and</text>
  <text start="587.13" dur="4.39">exactly why big</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="6.21">coin exists compare crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="591.52" dur="4.92">like Bitcoin aetherium like coin on</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="4.92">value market cap and supply for the last</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="5.39">year why do we have the need for</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="7.17">emergency liquidity in the first place</text>
  <text start="601.83" dur="8.71">because the central bankers actually</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="8.16">create the entire problems that we are</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="8.18">seeing today they create these crashes</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="9.33">so they can create more currency and</text>
  <text start="618.72" dur="7.42">flood the banks the stock market and put</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="9.99">more countries into debt more people</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="11.7">into debt so if we have a system that</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="7.71">has no interest attached to it and is</text>
  <text start="637.84" dur="5.49">created and balanced and it is open to</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="6.6">see what where all this is going because</text>
  <text start="643.33" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s an open ledger guess what we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="648.04" dur="5.97">have these types of problems we know</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="5.88">right now that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="6.51">cause these bubbles these bubbles pop</text>
  <text start="657.25" dur="4.62">and they crash the system because they</text>
  <text start="660.52" dur="6.24">make money going up they make money</text>
  <text start="661.87" dur="8.1">coming down think about why they are</text>
  <text start="666.76" dur="8.01">saying this at this point why are they</text>
  <text start="669.97" dur="8.79">so worried that cryptocurrency wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.77" dur="7.98">be able to handle the liquidity they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="7.68">letting you know that it&amp;#39;s a very good</text>
  <text start="682.75" dur="9.3">chance that cryptocurrency is going to</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="8.88">take over the currency market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="7.23">also telling us that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="695.32" dur="8.13">have another economic shock why would</text>
  <text start="699.28" dur="7.5">they bring all of this up remember the</text>
  <text start="703.45" dur="7.68">fastest way for them to bring us to a</text>
  <text start="706.78" dur="7.59">new system is to crash the old system to</text>
  <text start="711.13" dur="6.63">get rid of the old system before enough</text>
  <text start="714.37" dur="7.29">people catch on and they realize we</text>
  <text start="717.76" dur="6.36">rather have cryptocurrency we rather</text>
  <text start="721.66" dur="6.3">have something else besides what the</text>
  <text start="724.12" dur="5.76">central bankers are offering and we can</text>
  <text start="727.96" dur="4.92">see right now they might be</text>
  <text start="729.88" dur="4.95">foreshadowing the next economic shock</text>
  <text start="732.88" dur="4.86">where where they&amp;#39;re saying that one is</text>
  <text start="734.83" dur="6.18">coming up soon and if crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="737.74" dur="5.94">is the currency of the country or the</text>
  <text start="741.01" dur="6.63">world it will not be able to handle what</text>
  <text start="743.68" dur="5.61">is coming and they&amp;#39;re gonna show us what</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="3.72">is coming this is what they like to do</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="5.37">they like to tell us what&amp;#39;s coming and</text>
  <text start="751.36" dur="4.98">then they show us what&amp;#39;s coming and we</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="4.77">can see right now they&amp;#39;re building this</text>
  <text start="756.34" dur="5.34">idea now they&amp;#39;re telling us all of this</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="7.1">because they&amp;#39;re very nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="761.68" dur="8.25">that people are going to start demanding</text>
  <text start="766.53" dur="6.1">everyone use cryptocurrency instead of</text>
  <text start="769.93" dur="4.29">the central banking system this is why</text>
  <text start="772.63" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing it this is why</text>
  <text start="774.22" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;ve been telling you terrorists this</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="2.85">is why they&amp;#39;ve been telling you</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="4.02">criminals this is why they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="778.84" dur="3.6">you it&amp;#39;s used for blackmailing this is</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="3.45">why they&amp;#39;ve been doing all this this is</text>
  <text start="782.44" dur="4.05">why you&amp;#39;re seeing the volatility and</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="4.74">every single time I hate to say but</text>
  <text start="786.49" dur="5.88">cryptocurrency continually bounces back</text>
  <text start="789.13" dur="5.91">every single time because they can only</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="4.83">do so much I know they created the</text>
  <text start="795.04" dur="4.5">futures I know they&amp;#39;re trying everything</text>
  <text start="797.2" dur="4.32">they possibly can and we can see right</text>
  <text start="799.54" dur="5.52">now crypto market is in the beginning</text>
  <text start="801.52" dur="6.51">stages but this whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="805.06" dur="5.07">be used as a replacement</text>
  <text start="808.03" dur="4.5">for the central banking system now they</text>
  <text start="810.13" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen they want to</text>
  <text start="812.53" dur="4.02">keep their system intact they want to</text>
  <text start="814.48" dur="4.56">move it to the next country where they</text>
  <text start="816.55" dur="4.62">moved all the manufacturing they moved</text>
  <text start="819.04" dur="4.5">all the payment systems they moved all</text>
  <text start="821.17" dur="4.2">the exchanges they actually I shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="823.54" dur="4.65">say move they duplicated everything in</text>
  <text start="825.37" dur="5.16">another area because they knew over time</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="4.05">that this system wouldn&amp;#39;t last so they</text>
  <text start="830.53" dur="4.29">had to prepare for something brand-new</text>
  <text start="832.24" dur="4.62">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing now</text>
  <text start="834.82" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re getting very worried that here</text>
  <text start="836.86" dur="4.53">we are at this time and their systems</text>
  <text start="838.63" dur="4.71">coming down they see something else is</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="5">emerging and they&amp;#39;re very worried that</text>
  <text start="843.34" dur="5.58">people are going to opt for that instead</text>
  <text start="846.39" dur="5.14">because once the system comes down</text>
  <text start="848.92" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re going to need an event or</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="3.81">something some type of distraction to</text>
  <text start="853.48" dur="2.97">say it wasn&amp;#39;t us and it looks</text>
  <text start="855.34" dur="3.03">like they&amp;#39;re planning to blame this on</text>
  <text start="856.45" dur="4.32">Trump maybe they&amp;#39;ll have another type of</text>
  <text start="858.37" dur="4.23">an event where they can completely blame</text>
  <text start="860.77" dur="3.51">this on maybe another country a group or</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="2.94">anything like that but you can see right</text>
  <text start="864.28" dur="3.81">now they&amp;#39;re getting very worried and it</text>
  <text start="865.54" dur="5.19">this must mean that we&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="868.09" dur="4.14">close to the entire system coming down</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;re most likely gonna have to</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="3.78">bring this down pretty down fast because</text>
  <text start="873.79" dur="5.4">the crypto market is growing very very</text>
  <text start="876.01" dur="5.04">quickly new technologies coming out it</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="6.33">looks like companies like Facebook</text>
  <text start="881.05" dur="6.09">Amazon eventually employers they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="885.52" dur="3.72">going to start using it and they realize</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="3.63">eventually this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="4.08">happen just like the internet it started</text>
  <text start="890.77" dur="4.86">out as Oh prodigy from Sears if you</text>
  <text start="893.32" dur="4.41">remember that I mean actually before</text>
  <text start="895.63" dur="4.38">that it was Bolton boards were you</text>
  <text start="897.73" dur="4.65">dialed up like on a 300 baud modem and</text>
  <text start="900.01" dur="5.01">you went into a Bolton board then you</text>
  <text start="902.38" dur="4.38">had like prodigy then AOL came out more</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="5.01">and more people got into the dial-up</text>
  <text start="906.76" dur="8.37">because it was free to dial-up and then</text>
  <text start="910.03" dur="6.69">it moved on to the ISDN type of line and</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="3.8">then it moved into the cable modem and</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="5.16">then it kept going from there and</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="6.1">everyone was able to use it then we had</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="5.13">the smart phones come out and all of a</text>
  <text start="925.03" dur="3.78">sudden it took off and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="927.01" dur="3.9">same thing happen right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.81" dur="3.9">moving very very quickly in the crypto</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="3.54">market what we&amp;#39;re seeing is yes it</text>
  <text start="932.71" dur="3.78">started out with Bitcoin but now you</text>
  <text start="934.45" dur="3.78">have litecoin where Amazon and Facebook</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="3.84">and many other corporations are looking</text>
  <text start="938.23" dur="5.52">at this where you can use this to pay</text>
  <text start="940.33" dur="6.63">for products you can see salt which is a</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="4.86">lending type of cryptocurrency where you</text>
  <text start="946.96" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t need a bank or anything like that</text>
  <text start="948.61" dur="5.16">and you&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these type of</text>
  <text start="951.34" dur="4.29">technologies emerge and they realize</text>
  <text start="953.77" dur="4.38">that it&amp;#39;s happening very very quickly</text>
  <text start="955.63" dur="5.1">and they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous so it</text>
  <text start="958.15" dur="4.83">looks like they&amp;#39;re telling us and</text>
  <text start="960.73" dur="5.91">telegraphing us that they&amp;#39;re gonna bring</text>
  <text start="962.98" dur="6.54">the system down soon because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="966.64" dur="5.46">want people to catch on to the crypto</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="4.83">market a lot of people here Bitcoin a</text>
  <text start="972.1" dur="4.08">lot of people don&amp;#39;t understand it a lot</text>
  <text start="974.35" dur="4.47">of people don&amp;#39;t really know what it is</text>
  <text start="976.18" dur="4.38">they just hear what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="978.82" dur="3.18">is saying what the bankers are saying</text>
  <text start="980.56" dur="3.21">which they&amp;#39;re dictating to the corporate</text>
  <text start="982" dur="3.78">media they really don&amp;#39;t know what it is</text>
  <text start="983.77" dur="4.05">as of yet and they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="985.78" dur="3.359">spread yes there&amp;#39;s a small group of</text>
  <text start="987.82" dur="3.329">individuals that really</text>
  <text start="989.139" dur="3.72">what it is but the majority of the</text>
  <text start="991.149" dur="4.021">people yes they heard the term and they</text>

  <text start="1000.059" dur="3.96">right now they&amp;#39;re not hearing anything</text>
  <text start="1001.439" dur="4.95">else because what is happening is</text>
  <text start="1004.019" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared before this</text>
  <text start="1006.389" dur="3.81">whole thing takes off they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1008.069" dur="3.781">prepared to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="1010.199" dur="4.89">before anyone realizes that</text>
  <text start="1011.85" dur="5.37">cryptocurrencies will be used to replace</text>
  <text start="1015.089" dur="4.29">the central banks the banks and</text>
  <text start="1017.22" dur="4.5">everything else and we can see at this</text>

  <text start="1031.319" dur="3.12">transition if we moved on to the crypto</text>
