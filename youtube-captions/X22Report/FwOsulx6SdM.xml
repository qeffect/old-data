  <text start="72.13" dur="4.53">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.59" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how the central</text>
  <text start="76.66" dur="4.11">bank&amp;#39;s government&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="78.1" dur="5.31">to control the crypto market this is</text>
  <text start="80.77" dur="5.82">their endgame to control everything</text>
  <text start="83.41" dur="5.16">about it and out in Sweden what we see</text>
  <text start="86.59" dur="4.74">is that the Swedish government they are</text>
  <text start="88.57" dur="4.56">now testing crypto currencies now the</text>
  <text start="91.33" dur="4.17">government bankers across the world</text>
  <text start="93.13" dur="4.92">believe that this has the potential to</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="4.71">replace cash and make other payment</text>
  <text start="98.05" dur="4.44">system more efficient so Sweden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.21" dur="7.26">central bank is taking a serious look at</text>
  <text start="102.49" dur="8.909">Bitcoin now cash use in Sweden is</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="5.759">plummeting right now and the amount of</text>
  <text start="111.399" dur="4.431">currency that is in circulation is</text>
  <text start="113.229" dur="6.241">dwindling and they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="115.83" dur="6.07">experiment with crypto currency now</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="3.99">again they&amp;#39;re gonna want to control it</text>
  <text start="121.9" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re not gonna want this to be an</text>
  <text start="123.46" dur="4.11">open decentralized system they want to</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="3.36">make sure that they can control</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="3.63">everything about it and this is why we</text>
  <text start="129.519" dur="3.211">have a lot of different banks the UBS</text>
  <text start="131.2" dur="4.41">and many others and the central banks</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="6.75">that are trying to create their own type</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="6.39">of coin which they would control and say</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="4.38">listen we&amp;#39;ve stabilized it we&amp;#39;ve made it</text>
  <text start="142" dur="3.63">so it doesn&amp;#39;t fluctuate you can get out</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="4.29">of Bitcoin you can get out of the other</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="4.62">cryptocurrencies and move into ours and</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="4.5">it looks like this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="5.579">trying to do now out in Sweden the</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="5.97">Rick&amp;#39;s Bank they estimate that the cash</text>
  <text start="155.829" dur="5.851">transactions made up only of around 15%</text>
  <text start="158.62" dur="6">of all retail transactions last year the</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="4.97">number is down from 40% in 2010 thanks</text>
  <text start="164.62" dur="4.429">in large part to the massively popular</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="4.66">mobile payment type of system and</text>
  <text start="169.049" dur="4.181">they&amp;#39;re looking at this saying you know</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="4.47">maybe we should move into maybe Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="5.099">or something else and implement it in</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="3.929">Sweden and completely move everything in</text>
  <text start="178.329" dur="3.181">that direction because eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="4.351">going to happen they want everything to</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="4.379">go electronic here in the United States</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="2.92">we see the economy is still falling</text>
  <text start="185.889" dur="3.831">apart</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.15">consumer confidence well that has</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="3.84">dropped it looks like the American</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="4.68">public is losing faith in the stock</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="3.39">market they don&amp;#39;t believe the stock</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="3.12">market anymore even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="4.41">continually bobbing up and down right</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="4.59">now where it&amp;#39;s also hitting all-time new</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="4.14">highs they&amp;#39;re looking at it and say well</text>
  <text start="203.52" dur="4.68">wait a minute the corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="3.9">those are manipulated the corporations</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="3.21">are buying back their stocks their</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="3.84">actual sales revenue coming in does not</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="3.39">exist the valuation of all these</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="3.93">companies well some of them are a little</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="6.51">odd and it looks like we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="5.52">back in the dot-com bubble in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="3.57">people are looking at it right now</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="4.8">saying you know I really don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="6.39">this anymore now if we look at the sp500</text>
  <text start="227.49" dur="8.34">it has closed at a new record high 37</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="7.08">times so far this year now this is the</text>
  <text start="235.83" dur="6.15">most in the first quarter at the third</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="6.45">quarter period since 1997 when the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="5.64">closed at a new record 40 times before</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="4.59">the start of the fourth quarter and when</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="4.17">you look at this you say hmm this is</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="4.32">kind of odd is this really something</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="3.99">that can happen we&amp;#39;ve seen it happen</text>
  <text start="253.71" dur="5.88">many times before but every time it has</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="5.79">happened guess what occurred a recession</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="4.71">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading in that</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.77">direction we see Case Shiller well</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re out with their new home prices</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="3.66">saying that they&amp;#39;re growing at the</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="6.27">fastest pace in three years they hit an</text>
  <text start="270" dur="5.88">all-time new record high and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.74">interesting about this is now we are</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="7.71">above the point of the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="278.79" dur="7.89">back in 2008 we are now above that point</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="5.88">and if you really look at the Case</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="6.42">Shiller 20-city index you&amp;#39;re on year</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="6.84">well it really hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="6.06">pretty much flat line now let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="5.76">what Case Shiller just told us that</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="5.64">housing prices are moving up there</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re growing at a very fast pace but</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="5.52">when we look at what is really happening</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="7.17">in home sales it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="7.34">once again pending home sales new home</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="6.47">sales existing home sales they are all</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="6.28">down now we saw this in July</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="7.03">we saw it in August here we are in</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="7.699">September and August well it&amp;#39;s coming in</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="7.319">that yes sales are down once again and</text>
  <text start="331.639" dur="5.801">this does not look good now they thought</text>
  <text start="335.009" dur="7.38">there was going to be a 2.5 percent gain</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="7.62">but they&amp;#39;re down 3.4% this is huge so</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="4.831">what is happening here is that the</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="4.29">housing market is completely falling</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="5.669">apart now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="5.97">that we know that we had a hurricane in</text>
  <text start="352.889" dur="4.081">Texas we had one in Florida we know that</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="3.69">Puerto Rico the people are really</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="6.14">suffering down there there&amp;#39;s no water</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="8.129">electric it is a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="8.23">what the Census Bureau does is if the</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="7.111">agencies don&amp;#39;t report in they and they</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t have any sales information they</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="3">just say okay everything is unchanged</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll just leave everything the way it</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="4.56">is now we know because of what has</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.989">happened in Texas in Florida people</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="4.68">didn&amp;#39;t go out and they didn&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="4.53">any new homes so we know that sales are</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="3.72">much much lower than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.199" dur="4.431">reporting but since no sales have been</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="5.01">reported they just say things are</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="6.13">unchanged now let&amp;#39;s take this one step</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="5.16">further case-shiller in the 20 cities is</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="3.6">telling us how great everything is and</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="4.43">prices are increasing we see new homes</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="5.58">petting homes existing homes completely</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="6.25">imploding on themselves and then we see</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="6.9">that demand is down for all three types</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="5.099">of mortgages mortgages eligible for</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="3.509">guarantees by the government-sponsored</text>
  <text start="416.159" dur="5.73">enterprises such as Fannie Mae and</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="6.211">Freddie Mac well we know these are</text>
  <text start="421.889" dur="5.881">funded by the taxpayers well these are</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="6.57">down and when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="6.69">that why are these down because the</text>
  <text start="431.13" dur="6.63">everyday American person is not going</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="5.55">out and they&amp;#39;re not purchasing these</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="4.14">homes now there was a survey that was</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="4.08">conducted and it&amp;#39;s conducted quarterly</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="5.34">it tallied responses from the senior</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="4.5">executives at 190 mortgage lenders from</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="4.62">the largest banks to the smaller</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="5.729">specialty lenders to assess their views</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="5.489">in Outlook across a very dimensions</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="5.37">of the mortgage market these executives</text>
  <text start="457.349" dur="4.94">reported that demand over the past three</text>
  <text start="459.689" dur="5.581">months has dropped to a year-over-year</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="5.11">for purchase mortgages reaching the</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="5.819">lowest third quarter reading in the past</text>
  <text start="467.399" dur="6.871">two years lenders also reported that</text>
  <text start="471.089" dur="7.23">they refinancing those mortgages they</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="5.91">are also down so when Case Shiller comes</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="4.74">out and tells us how great everything in</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="6.9">is and prices are rising why are all</text>
  <text start="483.059" dur="6.931">these sales down why are the lenders</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="5.879">saying that people are not going out and</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="6.449">you know buying the houses through</text>
  <text start="492.959" dur="7.651">mortgages and why now since there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="496.439" dur="7.56">lack of demand at these lenders why are</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="6.419">they loosening their lending standards</text>
  <text start="503.999" dur="7.771">to bring more people in this is what we</text>
  <text start="507.029" dur="6.68">see when the banks want to push out more</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="4.139">debt we saw in the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="513.709" dur="4.031">when they finished with all those</text>
  <text start="515.909" dur="4.8">individuals that had you know good or</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="5.159">medium credit they went down to the poor</text>
  <text start="520.709" dur="4.981">credit down to the subprime then down to</text>
  <text start="522.899" dur="6.24">the sub subprime because what happens is</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="5.49">they can&amp;#39;t bring people in to push the</text>
  <text start="529.139" dur="5.221">debt out so they have to go down to the</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="7.769">next level and this ends up to be a</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="7.44">problem as we saw back in 2008 so the</text>
  <text start="538.949" dur="5.971">housing market right now is not going as</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.519">well as the corporate media is reporting</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="4.109">or the Fed is reporting or the</text>
  <text start="547.319" dur="4.26">government is reporting yes you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="549.029" dur="4.641">have still some hot areas but the rest</text>
  <text start="551.579" dur="5.31">of the country they&amp;#39;re feeling the pain</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="6.669">now the Fed cash carry he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="556.889" dur="7.021">and this is the manipulates fad</text>
  <text start="560.339" dur="7.321">president Neel Kashkari he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="6.029">there is no evidence that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.349">problem with inflation he said when I</text>
  <text start="569.939" dur="3.661">look at the economy I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="572.009" dur="5.01">signs that the economy is close to</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="4.77">overheating now we know that Yellen came</text>
  <text start="577.019" dur="4.531">out and told us that we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="578.37" dur="5.279">see any type of economic crisis in our</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="4.44">lifetime we have carryout they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.649" dur="4.29">telling us that he doesn&amp;#39;t see a problem</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="3.899">with inflation you see</text>
  <text start="587.939" dur="4.74">overheating and we heard this before</text>
  <text start="589.889" dur="4.26">back in 2008 before the recession where</text>
  <text start="592.679" dur="3.47">they weren&amp;#39;t forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="3.95">recession the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="596.149" dur="5.41">contained the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="598.099" dur="8.73">contained and AIG will only need one</text>
  <text start="601.559" dur="9.661">bailout well coming out of the Fed</text>
  <text start="606.829" dur="7.63">documentation it looks like the Fed</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="5.879">chair Janet Yellen openly admitted that</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="5.82">the Fed does not fully understand</text>
  <text start="617.099" dur="5.1">inflation and then just this morning</text>
  <text start="620.279" dur="5.73">Yellen stated that the Fed was wrong</text>
  <text start="622.199" dur="6.15">with employment and inflation now</text>
  <text start="626.009" dur="5.461">remember this is the Fed we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="628.349" dur="4.68">about the group of these group of</text>
  <text start="631.47" dur="5.539">individuals that are supposed to be</text>
  <text start="633.029" dur="7.17">running the country financially and</text>
  <text start="637.009" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re telling us they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="6.72">employment they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="642.929" dur="7.2">inflation the question is why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="646.919" dur="5.97">understand this well they do understand</text>
  <text start="650.129" dur="6.091">it they understand they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="652.889" dur="4.86">all the numbers they understand that the</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="4.289">government is manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="657.749" dur="5.43">numbers they realize that all this</text>
  <text start="660.509" dur="4.38">manipulation has thrown everything off I</text>
  <text start="663.179" dur="3.57">mean they knew there was a recession</text>
  <text start="664.889" dur="2.64">coming in 2008 they knew they were gonna</text>
  <text start="666.749" dur="2.73">pull the plug</text>
  <text start="667.529" dur="3.78">they know exactly what was happening</text>
  <text start="669.479" dur="3.78">just because they&amp;#39;re not telling you</text>
  <text start="671.309" dur="2.97">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they don&amp;#39;t know the same</text>
  <text start="673.259" dur="3.66">things happening right now</text>
  <text start="674.279" dur="4.05">they understand that inflation well the</text>
  <text start="676.919" dur="3.51">whole thing starting to heat up this is</text>
  <text start="678.329" dur="4.32">why they&amp;#39;re putting out the message that</text>

  <text start="682.649" dur="3.72">before everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="684.329" dur="5.52">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="686.369" dur="5.64">now there was a new study that backs up</text>
  <text start="689.849" dur="6.33">a theory that many Americans have long</text>
  <text start="692.009" dur="7.65">suspected the u.s. is no longer the land</text>
  <text start="696.179" dur="5.85">of opportunity despite what the National</text>

  <text start="702.029" dur="2.88">corporate media out there telling us</text>
  <text start="703.799" dur="3.6">that yes this is true</text>
  <text start="704.909" dur="4.59">now this research comes from the</text>

  <text start="721.62" dur="4.23">fundamentally changed the economic</text>
  <text start="723.15" dur="4.53">landscape of America now some of the key</text>
  <text start="725.85" dur="5.13">findings from the groundbreaking study</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="5.849">are the following 53 million individuals</text>
  <text start="730.98" dur="5.18">one in six Americans live in an</text>
  <text start="733.529" dur="5.131">economically distressed zip code</text>

  <text start="750.69" dur="5.43">of the distressed population is under 18</text>

  <text start="776.61" dur="4.86">percent of adults in distress of codes</text>
  <text start="778.62" dur="5.46">have no education beyond high school and</text>
  <text start="781.47" dur="4.83">one of the most disturbing findings is</text>
  <text start="784.08" dur="7.41">that the so called economic recovery has</text>
  <text start="786.3" dur="9.81">been a cruel allusion to a large swath</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="6.87">of the US and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="4.77">United States is no longer the land of</text>
  <text start="798.36" dur="4.59">opportunity only certain areas only</text>
  <text start="800.88" dur="3.87">certain individuals have this</text>
  <text start="802.95" dur="3.18">opportunity and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="804.75" dur="4.38">landscape of the United States has</text>
  <text start="806.13" dur="5.94">changed completely over the years where</text>
  <text start="809.13" dur="6.2">a lot of the wealth has been siphoned up</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="6.68">to the 1% and the rest of the country is</text>
  <text start="815.33" dur="6.37">working one to three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="818.75" dur="5.92">trying to make ends meet lost their</text>
  <text start="821.7" dur="5.1">high-paying job either got laid off or</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="4.53">fired never could define another job</text>
  <text start="826.8" dur="4.32">that they had and we can see this has</text>
  <text start="829.2" dur="4.32">been going on for a very long time I</text>
  <text start="831.12" dur="5.04">just saw the other day this dirty old</text>
