  <text start="53.05" dur="7.32">hi and welcome to the x22 report my name</text>
  <text start="56.92" dur="6.51">is Dave and this is episode 1614 a and</text>
  <text start="60.37" dur="5.52">today&amp;#39;s date is July 13th 2018 and the</text>
  <text start="63.43" dur="5.91">title the episode is the strategy behind</text>
  <text start="65.89" dur="5.55">the madness moves and countermoves let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.34" dur="5.01">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="71.44" dur="7.469">news now we know that the people of the</text>
  <text start="74.35" dur="7.379">UK they voted in a referendum to remove</text>
  <text start="78.909" dur="5.07">themselves from the EU and the people</text>
  <text start="81.729" dur="4.651">thought okay we had a vote the people</text>
  <text start="83.979" dur="5.661">have spoken and this is what we want now</text>
  <text start="86.38" dur="5.97">of course the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.42">establishment well they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="92.35" dur="3.9">to happen and we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for</text>
  <text start="94.06" dur="4.91">a very long time where they were going</text>
  <text start="96.25" dur="6.27">to do everything in their power to keep</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="7.75">the UK in the EU but maybe give the</text>
  <text start="102.52" dur="6.239">illusion that they&amp;#39;re out of the EU and</text>
  <text start="106.72" dur="3.72">it looks like this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.759" dur="3.9">trying to do but the people are not</text>
  <text start="110.44" dur="4.14">stupid that people understand what is</text>
  <text start="112.659" dur="6.561">going on and the long awaited white</text>
  <text start="114.58" dur="8.76">paper well it really doesn&amp;#39;t respect the</text>
  <text start="119.22" dur="7.269">referendum vote and we see that many</text>
  <text start="123.34" dur="4.619">people have resigned over this and a lot</text>
  <text start="126.489" dur="4.771">of people are saying that this is not</text>
  <text start="127.959" dur="6.511">what the people wanted when they voted</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="7.53">in the referendum and we see that people</text>
  <text start="134.47" dur="7.05">are very angry about this now when we</text>
  <text start="138.79" dur="5.25">look at this we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="6">certain groups that are loving this and</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="6.059">this is the establishment I mean the</text>
  <text start="147.52" dur="6.81">white paper has received a huge amount</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="6.091">of praise from the George Soros funded</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="3.84">open Europe think-tank</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="4.2">Henry Newman pending an open letter</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.37">pleading with Brussels to take seriously</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="6.48">the fair and reasonable proposal so you</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="5.37">can see right now that the people on one</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.369">side are saying no this is not what we</text>
  <text start="168.91" dur="5.609">want this is not what the whole vote was</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="5.071">about and what you&amp;#39;re doing here is</text>
  <text start="174.519" dur="4.171">you&amp;#39;re giving in into the EU on the</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="3.24">other side of the establishment saying</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="5.61">this is a great deal this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="180.55" dur="6.06">let&amp;#39;s do it now Trump as we know he is</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="6.18">out visiting Theresa May</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="6.03">and Trump is saying that the brexit</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="5.31">means that there&amp;#39;s going to be no US</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.97">trade deal possible and Trump is 100%</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="5.03">accurate if the U K keeps the</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="4.5">pre-existing trade pact with the EU and</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="8.11">essentially states economically attached</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="7.77">to the EU through this new deal then any</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="4.62">bilateral trade deal between the US and</text>
  <text start="210.88" dur="5.07">the UK is essentially impossible the EU</text>
  <text start="213.55" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t allow member nations can do to</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.05">conduct their own trade negotiations so</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.56">any agreement that keeps the UK attached</text>
  <text start="220" dur="4.95">to the EU economically means any trade</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.77">deal with the UK would be a trade deal</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="4.68">with the EU and the EU trade positions</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="4.739">are adverse to the ongoing economic</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="5.19">interest of the United States so what</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="5.131">may is done right now she screwed</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="5.28">herself and her nations economic</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="5.64">interests by following the path of the</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="6.359">European Union and giving in to the</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.94">establishment and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="4.891">that this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="3.84">now we might see the people they might</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="2.82">rally together and say this is</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="6.12">absolutely ridiculous they might ask</text>
  <text start="254.17" dur="6.809">made to leave her position and we might</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="3.66">see someone take her place now we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="4.261">have to see how this goes but we know</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="6.45">that the establishment they never want</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="7.14">to let anyone go once you&amp;#39;re in you are</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="6.42">in forever and they will try and do</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="7.26">anything they possibly can to keep every</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="7.41">single country within their system we</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="5.52">see the US budget deficit has hit six</text>
  <text start="282.85" dur="6.11">hundred and seven billion in nine months</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="7.53">and spending on interest right now is</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="7.57">exploding and the u.s. right now it has</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="6.63">a real bad spending problem and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="6">under control whatsoever and at this</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="5.19">point this is on purpose because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="5.03">happening here is they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="5.61">system to the edge because the</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.3">administration understands that the</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="3.93">central banking system cannot continue</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="5.28">on and the only way to destroy the</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="6.39">system is to push it to the edge use</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="5.31">everything that has been used before</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="3.81">this way you can turn around saying well</text>
  <text start="322.45" dur="3.6">this was your system this is how you</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="3.75">calculate it unemployment this is how</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.74">you calculate a GDP are you telling me</text>
  <text start="328" dur="4.55">this is all wrong because if it is then</text>
  <text start="330.79" dur="4.95">we need to look at this very closely and</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="4.45">with the central bank if this is not</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="3.75">correct then we need to look at the</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.17">central bank&amp;#39;s now according to the</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="4.41">latest monthly Treasury statement in</text>
  <text start="341.17" dur="5.73">June the u.s. collected around 316</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="5.91">billion in receipts consisting of 162</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="4.23">billion in individual income tax and 94</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="4.11">billion in Social Security and payroll</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="5.16">tax three billion in corporate tax 22</text>
  <text start="353.92" dur="5.64">billion in other taxes and duties a drop</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="5.19">of six point six percent from the three</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="5.16">hundred and thirty eight point seven</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="7.71">billion collected last June and a</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="8.25">reversal from the increasing trend so</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="5.85">the government spending is a huge</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="4.14">concern right now it&amp;#39;s a huge problem</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.29">and always has been this is why our debt</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="4.05">continually you know moves up and up and</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="4.02">up and when we look at the interest</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="4.68">payments they&amp;#39;re already rising rapidly</text>
  <text start="383.35" dur="5.43">and they just did an all-time high in</text>
  <text start="385.84" dur="5.43">the first quarter of 2018 and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="4.47">going to happen here is all these tax</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="3.33">receipts coming in and everything in</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="3.36">this happening of the debt continually</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="5.37">moves up as interest rates move up as</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="5.19">debt moves up guess what the tax</text>
  <text start="399.97" dur="6.15">receipts coming into the government will</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.95">not be enough to pay the interest to pay</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="6.66">the principal to pay any of this and</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="4.48">this is bit common sense I mean think</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="1.98">about it</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="3.09">look at your own household if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="4.14">making fifty thousand dollars a year and</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="4.47">you keep charging on your credit cards</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="4.17">and you take out another credit card and</text>
  <text start="420.79" dur="4.2">the interest continually rises you</text>
  <text start="423.07" dur="4.02">started out at ten percent let&amp;#39;s say and</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s really good for a credit card and</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="3.69">it moves up to fifteen percent then it</text>
  <text start="428.89" dur="3.81">moves up to 20 percent and you take out</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="3.78">another credit card but your income has</text>
  <text start="432.7" dur="4.26">gone up maybe two fifty one thousand or</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="5.25">fifty three thousand sooner or later</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="4.77">what happens is you don&amp;#39;t make enough to</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="3.93">pay for the interest you don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="3.63">enough to pay for the principal you</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="4.35">definitely don&amp;#39;t make enough to pay the</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="5.01">interest and principal and this is what</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="4.17">is happening here in the government</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re getting to a point where this</text>
  <text start="452.26" dur="3">cannot</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="6.84">to be sustained it is completely</text>
  <text start="455.26" dur="6.81">impossible now we understand that Trump</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="3.84">has been making a lot of bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="6.06">agreements with many different countries</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="5.67">and making separate agreements with all</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="4.02">these different countries and this is</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="4.29">his entire plan and for you look at this</text>
  <text start="472.15" dur="3.51">we can see that it seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="3.48">madness like oh why wouldn&amp;#39;t you go</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="3.24">through the World Trade Organization but</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="3.96">we need to understand that these</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="5.97">bilateral trade agreements they are</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="5.7">still being managed by the World Trade</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="6.03">Organization they&amp;#39;re still under the</text>
  <text start="486.88" dur="6.96">control of the WTO and I think this is</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.44">the plan where make all the bilateral</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="3.24">trade agreements these are all separate</text>
  <text start="495.34" dur="4.71">agreements and these were made with each</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="5.73">individual country not going through the</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="5.82">WTO yes they&amp;#39;re managing it but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="5.76">going through them and then put out the</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="5.19">idea that we don&amp;#39;t need the World Trade</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="3.54">Organization now think about if you have</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="3">everything in place when you have all</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.29">these bilateral trade agreements in</text>
  <text start="514.06" dur="4.859">place and you made deals with the</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="4.949">leaders of these countries and it just</text>
  <text start="518.919" dur="5.491">falls under the WTO because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="6.661">law right now to get rid of the WTO it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="6.66">that much easier and I see this is his</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="5.37">strategy in what he is doing he&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="531.07" dur="4.38">all these deals and when the time comes</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="5.88">to get rid of the WTO and remember this</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="5.94">is a globalist training agreement same</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="4.47">thing with the TPP same thing with NAFTA</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="3.72">he can get rid of it and it&amp;#39;ll be a lot</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="3.87">easier to get rid of now think about</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="4.71">this if he made all the agreements</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="4.71">through the WTO this would be</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="3.84">centralized they would make the</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="2.52">agreement they would handle the</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="3.3">agreement they would manage the</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="6">agreement and would be centralized in</text>
  <text start="556.96" dur="6.18">this area making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="5.93">agreements with each individual country</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s decentralized and guess what</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="7.93">globalist central bankers central</text>
  <text start="569.89" dur="6.42">bankers they hate decentralization they</text>
  <text start="574.69" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t like that they like it centralized</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="5.49">where they can control it and by Trump</text>
  <text start="579.1" dur="4.41">doing this it will allow him to say you</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="3.63">know what I have all the agreements</text>
  <text start="583.51" dur="3.09">there with all these different separate</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="3.329">countries</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="4.44">if one goes bad it&amp;#39;s not a big deal we</text>
  <text start="588.759" dur="4.77">still have the others and we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="4.529">the WTO to manage this we will manage</text>
  <text start="593.529" dur="3.961">this and we need to get rid of it and</text>
  <text start="595.569" dur="5.281">this is why you put the bread crumbs out</text>
  <text start="597.49" dur="4.74">there saying you know something we can</text>
  <text start="600.85" dur="3.39">walk away from the World Trade</text>
  <text start="602.23" dur="4.26">Organization we don&amp;#39;t really need it and</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="5.49">he did this on purpose he&amp;#39;s setting it</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="5.099">all up now we&amp;#39;ve been following a lot of</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="4.83">indicators on how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="611.589" dur="5.25">and we have been seeing that the economy</text>
  <text start="614.56" dur="4.98">and these indicators well it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="616.839" dur="4.68">too well and they&amp;#39;re all flashing a huge</text>

  <text start="621.519" dur="4.831">recession now we know the Fed has been</text>
