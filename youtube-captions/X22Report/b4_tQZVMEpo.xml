  <text start="73.39" dur="6.6">retail apocalypse it is not over as of</text>
  <text start="77.229" dur="4.92">yet there was a survey conducted in</text>
  <text start="79.99" dur="4.71">November about 40% of retail executives</text>
  <text start="82.149" dur="8.131">said they expected bankruptcy filings in</text>
  <text start="84.7" dur="8.339">the sector to increase in 2018 and what</text>
  <text start="90.28" dur="4.949">we are seeing right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="93.039" dur="4.86">actually happening there is more stores</text>

  <text start="97.899" dur="7.01">filing and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.229" dur="7.551">expecting the bankruptcies to surpass</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="8.311">2008 and maybe a little bit more than</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="7.21">2017 we see that Claire&amp;#39;s nine west</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="5.86">Banton and many other stores they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="5.37">been declaring bankruptcy and already</text>
  <text start="119.08" dur="4.409">this year we&amp;#39;ve had four major retail</text>
  <text start="121.36" dur="3.619">bankruptcies now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean these</text>
  <text start="123.489" dur="3.541">are the stories that are closing</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="3.37">thousands of stores are being closed</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="2.789">because of the bankruptcies but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.349" dur="4.321">just talking about the bankruptcies of</text>
  <text start="129.819" dur="4.92">these large chains and that is what</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now Cushman and</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="5.25">Wakefield they projected that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.68" dur="5.639">going to be around 12,000 retail stores</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="6.931">that enclose in 2018 up from 9,000 last</text>
  <text start="143.319" dur="6.901">year and at least 25 major retailers</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="6.63">would file for bankruptcy this year this</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="6.9">is how bad it is out in the retail space</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="5.88">and it&amp;#39;s just getting worse the reason</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="4.53">for this is because these unemployment</text>
  <text start="159.43" dur="4.74">numbers these manufacturing numbers the</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="6.059">GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re all completely</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="5.97">manipulated nothing has changed since</text>
  <text start="167.709" dur="5.971">Trump has come into office the things</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="6.569">that he is doing is not to improve the</text>
  <text start="173.68" dur="6.059">economy that we are in today that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="7.561">his objective his objective is to</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="6.811">prepare the country for the transition</text>
  <text start="184.27" dur="6.06">into a new currency</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="5.28">into a new economic realm that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s doing right now and what you need</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="4.2">to do is you need to start the process</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="2.55">of bringing back manufacturing I mean</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="2.57">think about it</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="5.4">the central banker is the deep state</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;ve been moving manufacturing out of</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="4.95">this country into China and other Asian</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="5.22">countries for a very long time and here</text>
  <text start="207.01" dur="4.92">we are we need to set up deals to bring</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="5.1">at least some of them back here or to</text>
  <text start="211.93" dur="4.62">start up some of the manufacturing here</text>
  <text start="214.27" dur="4.35">in this country because what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="4.1">happen is once the United States is no</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="5.04">longer the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="6.7">we have to figure out how to trade with</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="6.15">other countries that&amp;#39;s the big thing we</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.71">also have to stop foreign entities from</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="4.05">gobbling up all our companies and it</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="5.25">looks like Trump has already taken that</text>
  <text start="233.86" dur="10.01">step now we&amp;#39;ve most of us have heard of</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="10.89">the Qualcomm Broadcom merger or hostile</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="7">takeover now Trump stopped this he</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="6.03">created an executive order this</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="6.21">executive order just didn&amp;#39;t stop this</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="5.28">one deal it went much much further than</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="5.09">that and if you look at it and you read</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="6.93">it you can see that he is stopping</text>
  <text start="262.17" dur="7.21">foreign takeovers of US tech companies</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="4.95">this is what the order said there is</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="4.47">credible evidence that leads me to</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="4.23">believe that Broadcom limited a limited</text>
  <text start="273.85" dur="3.86">company organized under the laws of</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="4.14">Singapore along with its partners</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="4.3">subsidiaries or affiliates including</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="4.8">Broadcom Corporation in California</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="4.83">corporation and Broadcom came in LP and</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="4.41">Cayman Islands limited partnership and</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.7">their partners subsidies or affiliates</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="4.98">through exercising control of Qualcomm</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="4.51">incorporated a Delaware corporation</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="3.93">might take action that threatens to</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="5.46">impair the national security of the</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="7.68">United States and he went on to say that</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="7.13">this executive order will crush any</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="8.04">hopes that remain in some corners of</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="9.37">trying to capture and control US</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="6.63">companies so he&amp;#39;s putting a halt to this</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="5.13">so there&amp;#39;s no foreign takeovers</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="5.61">of large US tech companies right now he</text>
  <text start="323.14" dur="4.41">stopped that we see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="3.9">central bank&amp;#39;s out there that are</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="4.38">repatriating their gold we see Hungry&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="4.95">out there the Hungarian National Bank</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="5.1">has decided to bring back their gold</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.96">back home they decided to say you know</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="3.84">something we don&amp;#39;t like having their</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="2.93">gold in London we need to bring it home</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="4.2">now</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="5.05">up to now a hundred thousand answers of</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="4.5">the precious metal stored in London</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="6.18">which is in total worth about 33 billion</text>
  <text start="349.57" dur="5.82">or 130 million dollars of current gold</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="4.59">prices the decision seems to be in line</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="3.99">with the international trends as storage</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="4.95">of globe reserves out of the country is</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="5.97">now considered risky by more and more</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="4.71">central banks Austrian German Dutch</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="3.78">central banks are among those who have</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="4.56">decided to repatriate their gold</text>
  <text start="369.13" dur="5.37">reserves what these countries are</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="6.15">looking at is they see the writing on</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="6">the wall they understand the dollar is</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="5.49">doomed and they need a confidence</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="5.4">builder to build confidence once the</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="5.91">dollar completely implodes on itself and</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="5.46">those who have gold well they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="389.17" dur="4.47">ones who can build confidence you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="4.71">the back the currency by gold as long as</text>
  <text start="393.64" dur="4.65">you show it you have it you can say if</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s problems we have the gold this</text>
  <text start="398.29" dur="5.16">is what China and Russia have been doing</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;ve been amassing a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="8.12">gold and this is to build confidence in</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="8.43">the new system well their new system and</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="6.97">most likely that the system that has</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="6.44">been created out in China is controlled</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="7.59">by the central banks now for some reason</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="7.84">getting the idea that Trump along with</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="5.16">Xi Jinping and Russia Russia has already</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="4.05">taken control of their private western</text>
  <text start="431.29" dur="4.14">central bank they dictate what they want</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="5.34">so the Rothschilds aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="6.42">controlling Putin I think the move the</text>
  <text start="438.79" dur="5.4">next move along with China and the</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="3.99">United States is to force out the</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="3">central banking system I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="3.81">the private west of central bank system</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.82">I think this is what they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="449.65" dur="4.26">to do and this is why you hear tariffs</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="4.29">you hear</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="4.98">trade war because the only way to reset</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="4.5">the system to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="458.89" dur="5.52">banks is to bring down their entire</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="5.46">system because if we don&amp;#39;t bring down</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="3.09">their system there&amp;#39;s no point to any of</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="5.7">this</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="9.21">because their system allows different</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="7.08">factions to operate this is their source</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="5.64">of funding it&amp;#39;s designed that way and</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="3.3">they need to get rid of it now something</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="3">very interesting we know is that</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="3.42">Venezuela they started the petros</text>
  <text start="485.35" dur="3.75">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of sanctions on</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="4.17">them and they needed to get around the</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="4.56">sanctions we know that Iran gets around</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="5.88">the sanctions by using other currency</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="5.19">maybe using gold bartering Cuba&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="3.9">doing this Syria has been doing this a</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="3.66">lot of countries get around the</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="4.05">sanctions and Venezuela came up with a</text>
  <text start="502.51" dur="4.95">cryptocurrency called petros and they</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="4.8">were gonna use it to sell their oil well</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="4.41">now a new york capital management</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="4.2">company is set to break new ground on a</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="5.07">commodity investment by launching a new</text>
  <text start="513.76" dur="5.58">cryptocurrency backed entirely by oil</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.65">reserves now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="519.34" dur="5.28">and they&amp;#39;re gonna call it the petro</text>
  <text start="521.59" dur="4.83">dollar so the cryptocurrency is going to</text>
  <text start="524.62" dur="5.67">be backed by oil reserves natural gas</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="6.48">and similar commodities it also boasts</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="7.44">to be the world&amp;#39;s first gold globally</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="7.2">compliant digital currency now this is</text>
  <text start="537.73" dur="5">very interesting I do believe most</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="5.07">likely the central banks are behind this</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="5.29">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="4.89">that the petro dollar website touts that</text>
  <text start="548.02" dur="4.77">it will be linked to physical assets and</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="5.28">not thin air and will remain more price</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="6.12">stable as a result and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="555.34" dur="5.7">that this is a currency investors will</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="4.94">treat the petrodollar as a currency and</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="4.83">not an exchange-traded fund ETF</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="3.79">circumventing some tax reporting</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="3.75">obligation and is not expected to be</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="5.16">subject to annual tax but instead will</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="5.88">be taxed only upon any gains from their</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="7.35">sale of the petrodollar and it looks</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="6.839">like the banking system is trying to</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="5.73">create something to get Vince everyone</text>
  <text start="582.339" dur="5.761">that this is a stable cryptocurrency now</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that this</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="4.95">outside of the banking system but I</text>
  <text start="590.829" dur="5.521">think they&amp;#39;re doing this to get people</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.219">into it and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch it</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="4.53">very carefully because if it is truly</text>
  <text start="598.269" dur="5.13">not with the banking system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.88" dur="4.47">starting this up it means that we see</text>
  <text start="603.399" dur="3.571">something else happening here but we</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="4.38">need to watch that very very carefully</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="7.109">because the central banks they came out</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="7.279">and they actually broadcasted what</text>
  <text start="614.079" dur="8.49">they&amp;#39;re really afraid of remember a</text>
  <text start="617.009" dur="8.38">couple years ago about 2012 2013 the</text>
  <text start="622.569" dur="5.781">beylin documents were created because</text>
  <text start="625.389" dur="6.06">what happened in 2008 they were bailouts</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="4.929">government said no more bailouts we are</text>
  <text start="631.449" dur="4.231">done with that so they created bailing</text>
  <text start="633.279" dur="4.351">documents and they experimented in</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="3.839">Cyprus to see how it would work they</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="3.3">tried it in Greece but people went to</text>
  <text start="639.519" dur="3.421">their banks and started taking out their</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="4.29">funds and that caused a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="642.94" dur="3.899">problem so they came up with other you</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="4.919">know answers and stuff like that and we</text>
  <text start="646.839" dur="6.331">know that if or when the system comes</text>
  <text start="650.139" dur="6.921">down and they shut down the banks called</text>
  <text start="653.17" dur="7.56">a bank holiday they were going to set up</text>
  <text start="657.06" dur="5.5">limits on the ATM machines limits on how</text>
  <text start="660.73" dur="3.839">much cash you can take out from inside</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="5.16">of the bank and this way they can</text>
  <text start="664.569" dur="6.661">control the currency within the bank now</text>
  <text start="667.72" dur="5.489">their biggest worry right now is bank</text>
  <text start="671.23" dur="4.26">runs this is why they were trying to get</text>
  <text start="673.209" dur="3.69">rid of cash this is what they saw in</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="3.209">Greece and I said okay what we need to</text>
  <text start="676.899" dur="4.471">do is we need to start getting rid of</text>
  <text start="678.699" dur="4.95">cash this is why there was a big push to</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="4.11">say we don&amp;#39;t need cash anymore and of</text>
  <text start="683.649" dur="3.42">course they wanted to go to all digital</text>
  <text start="685.48" dur="3.63">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="687.069" dur="4.171">digital they wanted to go to Fiat</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="4.74">Digital which they can control widgets</text>
  <text start="691.24" dur="5.969">which is which that currency is</text>
  <text start="693.85" dur="5.82">centralized so they&amp;#39;re worried about</text>
  <text start="697.209" dur="4.921">bank runs now think about this for some</text>

  <text start="815.199" dur="6.45">something is going wrong they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="818.769" dur="4.44">to rush to the bank they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>

  <text start="829.149" dur="6.68">they need to do is go into the computer</text>

  <text start="835.829" dur="4.781">click of a button</text>
  <text start="837.459" dur="6.661">boom the cash now is removed from the</text>
  <text start="840.61" dur="5.219">account it&amp;#39;s in exchange and all they</text>
  <text start="844.12" dur="7.529">have to do is then purchase a</text>
  <text start="845.829" dur="7.411">cryptocurrency that&amp;#39;s how fast this</text>
  <text start="851.649" dur="3.781">could happen and they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="5.76">that when</text>
  <text start="855.43" dur="6.51">there is a bank run because the banking</text>
  <text start="859" dur="5.04">systems collapsing and the entire global</text>
  <text start="861.94" dur="7.98">economic system is collapsing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="8.16">afraid that people will do this and they</text>
  <text start="869.92" dur="6.03">should be afraid because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="6.09">everyone is going to do those people who</text>
  <text start="875.95" dur="6.75">already have accounts with coinbase</text>
  <text start="878.29" dur="7.02">or bit tricks or crack in or any of the</text>
  <text start="882.7" dur="5.37">other exchanges all you need to do is</text>
  <text start="885.31" dur="4.83">hook it to your bank account and with a</text>
  <text start="888.07" dur="5.22">click of a button those funds are then</text>
  <text start="890.14" dur="4.65">transferred into the exchange and then</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="4.739">you can purchase any cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="894.79" dur="6.2">from that point as long as the exchange</text>
  <text start="898.029" dur="5.601">handles the cryptocurrency you want and</text>
  <text start="900.99" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this and</text>
  <text start="903.63" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what they</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="5.25">can do about this and this is why</text>
  <text start="908.95" dur="4.759">they&amp;#39;re demonizing cryptocurrency so</text>
  <text start="911.98" dur="5.46">much this is why they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="913.709" dur="5.32">terrorists use it criminals use it it</text>
  <text start="917.44" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t be used as currency</text>
  <text start="919.029" dur="3.841">you should really stay away from it this</text>
  <text start="921.4" dur="4.83">is why they&amp;#39;re continually saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="922.87" dur="7.53">volatile it&amp;#39;s not stable maybe use our</text>
  <text start="926.23" dur="6.479">petrodollar cryptocurrency so we can see</text>
  <text start="930.4" dur="4.8">what is going on here and we could see</text>
  <text start="932.709" dur="5.25">the reasoning behind what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.2" dur="5.759">thinking here because if everyone takes</text>
  <text start="937.959" dur="5.491">their currency out of the banking system</text>
  <text start="940.959" dur="5.941">and puts it into cryptocurrency the</text>
  <text start="943.45" dur="6.78">entire banking system collapses think</text>
  <text start="946.9" dur="6.12">about it it just implodes on itself the</text>
  <text start="950.23" dur="5.609">central banking system implodes on</text>
  <text start="953.02" dur="5.4">itself everything becomes non</text>
  <text start="955.839" dur="4.981">operational and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.62">worried about back when they created the</text>
