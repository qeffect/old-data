  <text start="168.85" dur="5.6">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="5.92">Obamacare right now needs an influx of</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="8.85">22 million people now of course he wants</text>
  <text start="177.1" dur="9.139">to make eight to nine illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="6.24">citizens by the wave of his magical pen</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="7.691">to allow them to come on to Obamacare</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="7.27">he&amp;#39;s bringing in refugees to try to help</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="4.86">the situation out here he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="196.81" dur="6.54">having illegals come over the border to</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="8.04">help this out but guess what this whole</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="6.06">entire system is falling apart this was</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="4.5">not a benefit to the people i mean but</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="4.859">many people think it was but it really</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="5.73">isn&amp;#39;t most of the people can&amp;#39;t even get</text>
  <text start="214.269" dur="6.121">the subsidies and for those people who</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="5.67">do they still have deductibles so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="3.78">still paying out of pocket until you</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="3.78">reach the twenty-five hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="3.83">with a five-thousand and most people</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="3.479">that are just going to the doctor&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="228" dur="5.37">lot of times they don&amp;#39;t even meet the</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="6.991">deductible and it restarts each year and</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="6.55">think about what we had before let me</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="5.61">see if I didn&amp;#39;t want insurance I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.92" dur="4.74">have to pay a penalty well now if I</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t want insurance I have to pay a</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="6.389">penalty on each person in my family well</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="5.399">if I wanted insurance before I go out</text>
  <text start="251.049" dur="4.5">and to be competition because all the</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="4.5">insurance companies were fighting for</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="6.781">these people today all the insurance</text>
  <text start="258.549" dur="6.18">companies are in line because they know</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="5.25">that everyone has to take this or their</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="5.131">penalized so there&amp;#39;s no more competition</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="5.39">they can raise premiums whenever they</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="5.7">want and then they can raise them</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="3.699">however much they want makes no</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="2.669">difference at this point and this is</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="4.141">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and as the premiums</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="4.801">continually go up it is not a benefit to</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="4.32">the people whatsoever yes the</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="5.42">corporations are feeling the benefits</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="6.24">the people are not feeling the benefits</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="5.62">now there was another leaked section of</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="5.16">the TTIP and there&amp;#39;s a certain chapter</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="3.47">that shows that the EU is breaking its</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="2.24">promises on the end</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="4.02">fireman and there&amp;#39;s a section in there</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="4.86">which says the Commission claims that</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="4.77">its new investment reforms would protect</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="4.59">the right to regulate states could still</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="3.59">be sued if foreign investors considered</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="3.69">that a policy change violated the broad</text>
  <text start="309.92" dur="3.88">special rights that the Commission&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="4.86">reform investment proposal would give</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="5.88">them in other words the heart of the</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.98">European Commission&amp;#39;s philosophy is the</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="6.69">implicit acceptance that investors</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="8.04">rights take precedence over the public&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="6.51">rights in this case those concerning the</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="5.01">environment so they&amp;#39;re going to overrule</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.44">what the public is saying and go with</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.99">the corporations now we know the TPP the</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="5.7">TTIP all of this has been kept a secret</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="4.51">they don&amp;#39;t want the people to know</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s in it because this does not</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="5.09">benefit anybody it benefits the</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="6">corporations and the central banks and</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="5.25">as more and more of this as being leaked</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="9.39">out we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more of this</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="9.16">being true and if this does pass and it</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.35">makes it to the desk of the president</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="5.67">and he signs off on it and and this</text>
  <text start="367.29" dur="6.06">whole thing is now law this is going to</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="5.69">be a problem for the majority of the</text>
  <text start="373.35" dur="6.87">world that is signed on to this and the</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="8.26">people are going to be brought down on</text>
  <text start="380.22" dur="7.22">the ladder to the lowest rung while</text>
  <text start="384.42" dur="7.35">corporations are going to be brought up</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="7.12">so the governments will no longer have a</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="5.73">say the power will shift to the</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="7.95">corporations and this is where the</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="8.52">problems come in now we know the Senate</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="6.84">passed sissa they voted on it and we</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="7.14">know what cissa is this is a bill that</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="6.39">allows the government to receive all</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="5.13">your private information from all the</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="5.64">corporations and they will not hold the</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="4.56">corporations liable whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="2.97">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this there</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="4.59">were certain amendments that were tied</text>
  <text start="424.35" dur="6.84">to sis and yet remember Dianne Feinstein</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.67">she&amp;#39;s the one who created this</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="6.95">and there are certain amendments that</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="8.58">were proposed which were turned down</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="7.96">example the widen amendment from Senator</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="6.87">Wyden he would have inserted language to</text>
  <text start="446.1" dur="6.78">protect personally identify information</text>
  <text start="448.56" dur="6.72">by making companies remove it to the</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="4.92">extent feasible because personal</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="5.34">information doesn&amp;#39;t provide information</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="5.85">about cyber threats now I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="6.06">many many times before getting my</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="8.24">shopping habits does not help the</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="9.95">government find these cyber attackers</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="10.54">not at all but it&amp;#39;s funny that amendment</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="10.18">was turned down the Heller amendment was</text>
  <text start="482.43" dur="7.86">put forth by senator Dean Heller in case</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="5.58">the Wyden amendment failed it had</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="4.47">similar measures and will put the onus</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="4.08">on the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="4.86">to remove personally identify</text>
  <text start="496.47" dur="5.28">information that doesn&amp;#39;t look related to</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="6.35">cyber threats well none of it is related</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="7.68">to cyber threats that was turned down</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="7.36">the Leahy amendment introduced by</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="5.76">senator pat leahy was offered to deal</text>
  <text start="513.33" dur="4.22">with the issues of sis&amp;#39;s sweeping</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="5.22">Freedom of Information Act exemptions</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="3.76">even with the amendment most information</text>
  <text start="520.41" dur="3.6">shared between the federal government</text>
  <text start="521.31" dur="6.63">and companies would already be protected</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="5.94">by the Freedom of Information Act he</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="7.28">said the vast majority of the exemption</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="8.97">is already protected from disclosure now</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="5.58">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="6.3">really looking for cyber attackers</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="7.09">they&amp;#39;re not looking for any of this</text>
  <text start="545.22" dur="6.75">whatsoever what they&amp;#39;re doing is they</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="5.64">found a way to circumvent pretty much</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="4.08">everything to get your personal</text>
  <text start="553.53" dur="5.25">information and they&amp;#39;re saying well this</text>
  <text start="556.05" dur="4.7">is legal now and they&amp;#39;re having the</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="5.07">corporations because the corporations</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="4.389">already have all your information the</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="4.589">ISP providers</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="8.43">the search engines the phone</text>
  <text start="568.439" dur="7.74">manufacturers the stores and they just</text>
  <text start="573.569" dur="5.19">want all of that send to the government</text>
  <text start="576.179" dur="4.981">and they won&amp;#39;t hold the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.759" dur="5.58">liable for anything that happens to your</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="6.119">information and if the President does</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="5.67">not veto this bill he&amp;#39;ll be showing that</text>
  <text start="587.279" dur="6.15">his administration never truly cared</text>
  <text start="590.009" dur="8.401">about the open Internet he didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="593.429" dur="7.111">about privacy that everything that he</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.419">talked about stopping the spying and</text>
  <text start="600.54" dur="9.62">everything like that would be completely</text>
  <text start="603.829" dur="10.69">fake phony false it would be a lie and</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="6.969">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is you know</text>
  <text start="614.519" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s going to pass this you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.129" dur="2.88">going to be rush right through because</text>
  <text start="618.359" dur="4.26">what the central bank the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.009" dur="7.2">want and they want to spy on every</text>
  <text start="622.619" dur="6.81">single person I mean right now the</text>
  <text start="627.209" dur="6.511">government&amp;#39;s threat to the Internet</text>
  <text start="629.429" dur="7.62">freedom is growing they are continually</text>
  <text start="633.72" dur="6.329">pushing their way into the internet</text>
  <text start="637.049" dur="6.931">trying to control it now before aaron</text>
  <text start="640.049" dur="8.1">swartz death he is the reddit developer</text>

  <text start="655.919" dur="6.801">with a u.s. senator during the topic of</text>
  <text start="658.169" dur="8.58">web censorship and he went and he asked</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="7.569">the senator why despite being such a</text>
  <text start="666.749" dur="6.33">progressive despite giving up speech in</text>
  <text start="670.289" dur="6.9">favor of civil liberties why did he want</text>
  <text start="673.079" dur="6.86">to censor the internet and the typical</text>
  <text start="677.189" dur="7.531">politician smile faded from his face and</text>
  <text start="679.939" dur="8.92">as I started to burn fury read and he</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="6.719">started shouting at Aaron Swartz these</text>
  <text start="688.859" dur="4.92">people on the internet they think they</text>
  <text start="691.439" dur="4.05">can get away with anything they think</text>
  <text start="693.779" dur="3.93">they can just put anything up there</text>

  <text start="697.709" dur="4.28">they put out</text>
  <text start="699.059" dur="6.15">everything well we&amp;#39;re going to show them</text>

  <text start="732.299" dur="8.13">all of us together we need to make this</text>
  <text start="737.609" dur="5.13">very difficult for them because they</text>

  <text start="986.25" dur="4.92">bringing in more troops to Iraq and</text>
  <text start="987.96" dur="7.41">Syria and of course this is completely</text>
  <text start="991.17" dur="6.09">illegal because right now Syria has not</text>
  <text start="995.37" dur="4.08">asked the u.s. to come in with troops</text>
  <text start="997.26" dur="9.63">and if troops are coming in this is a</text>

  <text start="1006.89" dur="9.18">out there saying that we did not ask for</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="8.43">troops in our country so something is</text>
  <text start="1016.07" dur="5.01">wrong here but we&amp;#39;re getting information</text>
  <text start="1018.85" dur="4.45">that the u.s. is planning to send</text>
  <text start="1021.08" dur="6.09">military advisers and Special Forces to</text>
  <text start="1023.3" dur="4.95">the front lines in Iraq and of course</text>

  <text start="1028.25" dur="7.44">all these troops into Syria into Iraq to</text>
  <text start="1032.36" dur="5.03">fight the Islamic state well a rack is</text>
  <text start="1035.69" dur="5.36">saying something completely different</text>
  <text start="1037.39" dur="7.9">they said the us-led anti-isil coalition</text>
  <text start="1041.05" dur="7.66">targeted the Iraqi forces instead of the</text>
  <text start="1045.29" dur="7.65">Islamic state the coalition warplanes</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="8.04">pounded the Iraqi forces after they</text>
  <text start="1052.94" dur="6.66">advanced the other city of Ramadi so the</text>
  <text start="1056.75" dur="6.51">United States even in Iraq they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1059.6" dur="9.33">protecting their proxy army and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1063.26" dur="7.41">taking out the Iraqi forces this is just</text>
  <text start="1068.93" dur="5.88">unbelievable so we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1070.67" dur="6.51">in time that the United States they are</text>
  <text start="1074.81" dur="4.59">protecting and pushing their forces</text>
  <text start="1077.18" dur="4.98">where they want them they don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="1079.4" dur="9.69">of these countries interfering with</text>
  <text start="1082.16" dur="10.5">their mission now Russia has set up a</text>
  <text start="1089.09" dur="7.44">no-fly zone which is now preventing the</text>
  <text start="1092.66" dur="6.03">us-israel UK from bombing Syria now they</text>
  <text start="1096.53" dur="2.82">set up a bubble Israel tried to</text>
  <text start="1098.69" dur="3.42">penetrate this</text>
  <text start="1099.35" dur="5.52">many many times and Russian forces have</text>
  <text start="1102.11" dur="5.4">forced them back so they can&amp;#39;t gain</text>
  <text start="1104.87" dur="7.16">access to Syria right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1107.51" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re bombing runs have declined</text>
  <text start="1112.03" dur="5.71">because Russia with their satellites</text>
  <text start="1115.25" dur="7.5">with their anti jamming system and with</text>
  <text start="1117.74" dur="7.5">their s 400 / 500 missiles they&amp;#39;ve set</text>
  <text start="1122.75" dur="5.789">up a bubble and they&amp;#39;re monitoring the</text>
  <text start="1125.24" dur="5.91">entire area so they all know exactly</text>
  <text start="1128.539" dur="7.441">what they&amp;#39;re bombing and this is posing</text>
  <text start="1131.15" dur="8.12">a problem now Washington is still out</text>
  <text start="1135.98" dur="7.05">there saying that Assad still must go</text>
  <text start="1139.27" dur="6.389">spokesman John Kirby conceded though</text>
  <text start="1143.03" dur="5.49">that the Syrian government led by Assad</text>
  <text start="1145.659" dur="6.461">may have a role to play in a political</text>
  <text start="1148.52" dur="6.69">transition of the country now reporters</text>
  <text start="1152.12" dur="9.03">were asking direct questions and they</text>
  <text start="1155.21" dur="10.62">asked Kirby what happens if there are</text>
  <text start="1161.15" dur="7.5">elections and the people of Syria vote</text>
  <text start="1165.83" dur="7.2">for Assad and is reelected what happens</text>
  <text start="1168.65" dur="6.779">then Kirby refused to even entertain</text>
  <text start="1173.03" dur="4.05">that possibility because you have to</text>
  <text start="1175.429" dur="4.74">remember back in 2014 when they have the</text>
  <text start="1177.08" dur="5.4">elections in June 86 to eighty-seven</text>
  <text start="1180.169" dur="6.031">percent of the people in Syria voted for</text>
  <text start="1182.48" dur="8.37">Assad and this is the problem they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1186.2" dur="7.65">want these elections to happen again so</text>
  <text start="1190.85" dur="5.459">their goal is still the same Assad must</text>
  <text start="1193.85" dur="3.75">leave and when they say he can be part</text>
  <text start="1196.309" dur="3.021">of the transitional government that</text>
  <text start="1197.6" dur="8.939">means they&amp;#39;re just throwing them out</text>
  <text start="1199.33" dur="12.06">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of them now part of</text>
  <text start="1206.539" dur="8.611">the Islamic state is being transported</text>
  <text start="1211.39" dur="5.89">from Syria because we know they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="1215.15" dur="6.99">the run because Russia the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1217.28" dur="6.33">they are bombing the heck out of the</text>
