  <text start="106.729" dur="5.581">we&amp;#39;re starting to realize that many</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="6.449">countries now are looking to get around</text>
  <text start="112.31" dur="3.9">the sanctions and we knew that this was</text>
  <text start="115.159" dur="3.031">going to happen first</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="4.109">it was Venezuela where they created</text>
  <text start="118.19" dur="5.76">their own cryptocurrency now it looks</text>
  <text start="120.319" dur="5.55">like Iran they are moving in that same</text>
  <text start="123.95" dur="5.119">direction where they&amp;#39;re gonna create</text>
  <text start="125.869" dur="7.261">their state issued cryptocurrency to</text>
  <text start="129.069" dur="5.14">circumvent the US sanctions now once</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="3.719">again we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="5.761">cryptocurrency the blockchain on how</text>
  <text start="136.849" dur="5.041">this will go around the central banking</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="4.2">system now remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t like this any type of</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="6.81">currency that is not theirs where they</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="5.22">can control it they do not like and this</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="3.6">is something that they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="6.45">stop but I don&amp;#39;t think they can I think</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="6.48">once countries once the people around</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="4.88">the world understand that you can use</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="4.92">cryptocurrency and it is a currency and</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="4.57">it&amp;#39;s not controlled by a central bank</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="3.99">and you can create these crypto</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="4.29">currencies without interest attached I</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="4.409">think more and more individuals more</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="4.59">countries more entities they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="174.379" dur="6.151">understand how powerful the blockchain</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="5.43">is plus you can track everything that</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="3.87">has been you know all transactions</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="4.39">everything that&amp;#39;s been going on with</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="5.95">crypto currencies it&amp;#39;s a ledger</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="5.22">system is a truth machine and all what</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re seeing today with this covert</text>
  <text start="192.21" dur="4.86">money this black money this dark pulls</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="4.62">of money and everything else well that</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="3.9">kind of goes away and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="4.02">difficult to hide you can always trace</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="5.1">it to an account because it has to be</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.86">received by an address it&amp;#39;s not printed</text>
  <text start="206.07" dur="4.29">paper and things like that so these</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="5.85">intelligence agencies that are using</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="5.88">this type of covert money that we see</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="3.63">today it will be very very difficult for</text>
  <text start="216.24" dur="3.21">them to do this now if you want to learn</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="3.96">more about this and you want to learn</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="5.76">more about crypto currencies you can go</text>
  <text start="221.58" dur="6.15">to the x-22 reports cool calm and there</text>
  <text start="225.21" dur="3.9">is two sections to it one is the school</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.45">which will teach you about crypto</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="5.31">currencies the other is the trading room</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="5.73">yes they both cost money and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.07">interested read the website read and</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="5.7">understand what it is and you&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="239.49" dur="5.82">to go to either section or both if you</text>
  <text start="242.61" dur="5.25">would like now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.19">world economy it is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="8.22">apart we also understand that the people</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="8.13">out in the UK voted away from the vote</text>
  <text start="256.08" dur="3.75">of themselves away from the EU and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="3.419">been saying for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="6.54">central bankers they are going to</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="8.221">continually try to stop this now their</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="5.76">move right now is to say that the brexit</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="4.41">deal isn&amp;#39;t that great this was done on</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="5.25">purpose it&amp;#39;s not what the people really</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="6.51">wanted and maybe we should do the</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.48">following maybe we should have a second</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="5.07">referendum to see if the people are</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="5.07">still interested in breaking away from</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="6.95">the EU and we see already there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="7.65">petition that has been signed by about</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="6.4">300,000 Britons and they&amp;#39;re demanding a</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="6.6">second brexit referendum now this is</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="6.66">being done on purpose to say look we</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="5.28">tried it this is the deal people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="3.87">want this let&amp;#39;s have a referendum and</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="2.94">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="2.94">going to try to manipulate this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="3.39">talking about the EU the central bankers</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="4.35">the establishment and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="5.1">say look the people now do not want this</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s been dragged on this is the deal</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="2.64">and</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="3.78">look where we are today now remember the</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="5.28">central bankers this has been their plan</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="6.15">all along their plan was never to let</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="3.51">the UK leave they never wanted this to</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="3.66">happen</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="4.17">and we see right now this is the move</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re trying to make now is that going</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="5.34">to work maybe maybe not but the people</text>
  <text start="338.76" dur="4.47">already had a referendum that people</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="4.98">already said listen this is what we want</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="4.89">now of course who&amp;#39;s making these bad</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="4.83">deals it&amp;#39;s not the people it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="6.06">government officials once again those</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="7.05">people who are intertwined with the</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="6.87">establishment and we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="6.54">already playing out we see out in Sydney</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="4.89">well real estate the economy it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="4.38">doing that well even though people think</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s doing well it&amp;#39;s an illusion and</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re seeing the housing bubbles they</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="4.8">are starting to pop now home prices in</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="7.08">Sydney in Melbourne there at there back</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.88">to the 2016 levels and these tumbling</text>
  <text start="380.52" dur="4.68">housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="6.24">are the main drivers behind the first</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="6.18">annual drop in national property prices</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="5.55">in six years and this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="4.74">new report the national median house</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="5.55">price fell one percent over the June</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="5.16">quarter and a year according to a report</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="4.32">by property classifieds group domain</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="4.98">released on Thursday it is the first</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="5.58">time values have fallen on an annual</text>
  <text start="406.26" dur="5.31">basis since June of 2012 the negative</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="3.9">national growth rate reflects weakening</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="3.81">housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="5.16">which together represent about</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="3.72">two-thirds of Australia&amp;#39;s housing market</text>
  <text start="418.35" dur="4.02">by value</text>
  <text start="419.1" dur="5.73">Sydney house housing prices fell by 4.5</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="5.61">percent in a 12 months the end of June</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="4.74">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that things are</text>
  <text start="427.98" dur="3.33">starting to break down the same things</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="3.51">happen in Canada the same things</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="6">happening United States the same things</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="6.48">happening in the EU now what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="4.05">here is many individuals they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="3.81">purchased their homes and we saw this</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="4.77">back in the US when we went through our</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="6.24">housing crisis in 2008 they bought at</text>
  <text start="446.13" dur="5.1">the top they took out mortgages at the</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="3.78">top and then housing prices started to</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="3.299">come down and now they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="453.39" dur="5.399">call this mortgage</text>
  <text start="454.529" dur="6.54">Prison where individuals are trapped in</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="5.82">these mortgages and there&amp;#39;s no way out</text>
  <text start="461.069" dur="5.33">and I think what we&amp;#39;re going to see just</text>
  <text start="464.609" dur="5.88">like we saw here in the United States</text>
  <text start="466.399" dur="6.04">many individuals in other parts of the</text>
  <text start="470.489" dur="4.26">world in Australia in Canada in Europe</text>
  <text start="472.439" dur="5.34">who have been purchasing at these very</text>
  <text start="474.749" dur="7.32">very high prices they are going to be in</text>
  <text start="477.779" dur="6.15">mortgage prison and this means that</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re going to be underwater</text>
  <text start="483.929" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re gonna have very high mortgages</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="5.07">on these very high priced homes and the</text>
  <text start="488.489" dur="5.36">values of these homes are going to drop</text>
  <text start="490.709" dur="6.6">and then plummet and then crash and</text>
  <text start="493.849" dur="5.2">while we&amp;#39;re going through this they will</text>
  <text start="497.309" dur="4.2">not be able to get rid of their homes</text>
  <text start="499.049" dur="6.15">and they&amp;#39;ll be stuck with this gigantic</text>
  <text start="501.509" dur="5.16">mortgage now we talked about how both</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="4.8">sides you&amp;#39;re trying to control the</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="5.64">narrative and we see already the central</text>
  <text start="509.999" dur="3.75">banks they&amp;#39;re making their move where</text>
  <text start="512.309" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="513.749" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re already hinting that it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="516.269" dur="5.52">to be the tariffs that wreck the economy</text>
  <text start="518.639" dur="6.24">the mainstream media is going to report</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="4.53">on how the economy is starting to break</text>
  <text start="524.879" dur="4.14">apart and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="526.319" dur="4.981">already now this is coming out of CNBC</text>
  <text start="529.019" dur="6.451">they&amp;#39;re saying that housing market is</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="7.55">showing signs of cracking anything-goes</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="6.059">list price strategy is no longer working</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="5.469">the mainstream media right now is now</text>
  <text start="541.529" dur="4.35">pushing the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="544.319" dur="3.75">and they&amp;#39;re talking about housing today</text>
  <text start="545.879" dur="5.43">and they&amp;#39;re saying even the hottest</text>
  <text start="548.069" dur="6.301">markets there is an affordability limit</text>
  <text start="551.309" dur="6.33">and that limit is clearly now being hit</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="5.519">we&amp;#39;re still selling most every home but</text>
  <text start="557.639" dur="6.24">now it&amp;#39;s usually with just one or two</text>
  <text start="559.889" dur="7.861">offers over the 10 to 15 offers we were</text>
  <text start="563.879" dur="6.411">seeing earlier in the year and we talked</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="4.74">about this before we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="4.93">we knew it was coming</text>
  <text start="572.49" dur="3.99">we said real estate hit the top we said</text>
  <text start="575.22" dur="3.869">it was an illusion</text>
  <text start="576.48" dur="4.409">and now the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.089" dur="3.331">starting to pick up on this it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="580.889" dur="3.721">because oh they want to show the</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="4.32">economy&amp;#39;s doing poorly because of the</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="3.69">central bank they&amp;#39;re doing it to show</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="4.53">that whatever Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="5.67">the Patriots it is not working and on</text>
  <text start="591.27" dur="5.46">the other side we have Trump and the</text>
  <text start="593.97" dur="6.51">Patriots where they&amp;#39;re using everything</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="8.58">that was given to them and pushing it to</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="8.22">the edge and this is why we saw the real</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="6.45">GDP numbers come out and everything was</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="5.91">revised and it was pushed up by a</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="6.75">trillion dollars to give us that 4.1</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="7.38">percent GDP number this was all done on</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="5.7">purpose to drive this economy to the</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="5.64">edge now does it really mean that</text>
  <text start="624.21" dur="5.58">the GDP number was really 4.1 percent</text>
  <text start="627.63" dur="4.56">that we&amp;#39;re really doing much much better</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="4.41">than we&amp;#39;ve ever done before no not much</text>
  <text start="632.19" dur="5.76">has changed I mean there&amp;#39;s a couple of</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="7.05">tariffs in place we&amp;#39;re still seeing</text>
  <text start="637.95" dur="5.46">retail plummet people are not spending</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="4.65">the way they used to people are losing</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="5.04">their jobs salaries aren&amp;#39;t going up the</text>
  <text start="645.9" dur="4.86">way they were we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="648.45" dur="3.83">you know telling us that there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="4.74">job openings we can&amp;#39;t find qualified</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="5.83">workers if that&amp;#39;s true then they be</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="4.89">demanding a higher salary which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.11" dur="5.49">not seeing at all so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
