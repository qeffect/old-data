  <text start="75.649" dur="6.451">mueller is still pushing forward with</text>
  <text start="78.89" dur="5.58">the investigation and so far throughout</text>
  <text start="82.1" dur="5.37">this whole entire time period nothing</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="5.49">really has been done he can&amp;#39;t find any</text>
  <text start="87.47" dur="4.53">evidence of Russian collusion and Larry</text>

  <text start="116.899" dur="5.58">donors and supporters in large part and</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="5.13">we can see right now that he is pushing</text>
  <text start="122.479" dur="5.43">for this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="124.609" dur="6">that the special counsel had previously</text>
  <text start="127.909" dur="5.311">done legal work for Michael Flynn</text>

  <text start="140.42" dur="3.87">Clayman is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="141.88" dur="5.41">there&amp;#39;s too many things going on here</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="5.64">too many conflicts of interests and he</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="5.66">needs to be removed from this</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="6.27">investigation and so far after all these</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="7.45">interviews and everything so far they</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="6.69">can&amp;#39;t find Russian collusion at all now</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.95">moving towards Cuba something very</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="5.939">strange happened and there was this</text>
  <text start="165.35" dur="7.139">sonic attack in Cuba and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="7.621">that it hit the embassy there in in Cuba</text>
  <text start="172.489" dur="6.571">of the United States and it injured or</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="5.19">people didn&amp;#39;t feel well and it looks</text>
  <text start="179.06" dur="4.8">like 21 individuals Americans were</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="4.95">affected by this and US Secretary of</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="3.33">State Rex Tillerson said that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="2.81">considering</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="4.7">closing down the US Embassy in Havana</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="4.48">following this unexplained incident and</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="4.69">Cuba is saying we don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="5.37">talking about we didn&amp;#39;t put this sonic</text>
  <text start="196.58" dur="4.62">blast at the Embassy we didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="4.59">anything like this we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="5.28">happened and this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="4.44">and nobody could really explain what</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="2.61">actually happened maybe this was a CIA</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="2.61">operation</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="3.99">maybe this something else was going on</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="4.41">but right now Cuba is denying it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="3.96">looking to shut down the embassy and</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="4.17">this looks like something was very very</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="5.67">strange that was occurring out in Spain</text>
  <text start="219.47" dur="5.58">we can see the protest and the movement</text>
  <text start="222.71" dur="4.47">to have this referendum is really</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="4.92">picking up steam there&amp;#39;s about 700</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="6.48">Catalan mayors who are out there saying</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="6.39">that yes we want this referendum we want</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="4.05">this to move forward and Spain is doing</text>
  <text start="236.36" dur="5.1">whatever they possibly can to stop this</text>
  <text start="237.71" dur="6.3">but it is not working whatsoever Lavrov</text>
  <text start="241.46" dur="5.04">is going to meet Venezuelan Brazilian</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="4.17">Cuban top diplomats they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>

  <text start="248.18" dur="2.91">going on here</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="3.81">we know that Venezuela is moving away</text>
  <text start="251.09" dur="4.02">from the dollar they&amp;#39;re gonna be using</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="5.31">the yuan and we can see there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="255.11" dur="4.41">bypassing the dollar completely and of</text>
  <text start="258.2" dur="3.3">course Lavrov is probably going out</text>
  <text start="259.52" dur="4.35">there to talk about all of this</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.35">especially with Brazil and Cuba we also</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="3.42">see that Lavrov and tiller soon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="4.65">going to meet to talk about Syria and</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="6.99">Ukraine at the UN General Assembly and</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="6.18">we can see that the situation out in</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.52">North Korea the situation out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.22">the situation in Syria well a lot of</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="5.55">things happening right now and it is not</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="6.09">going well for the Cabal basically they</text>
  <text start="285.35" dur="4.53">are in desperate mode right now now we</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="3.36">know that they&amp;#39;re out there pushing the</text>
  <text start="289.88" dur="3.72">idea that North Korea is going to be</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="4.41">attacking South Korea&amp;#39;s getting ready to</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="4.98">protect themselves from an EMP from a</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="5.67">cat by hih by a biological weapon attack</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="4.95">and they&amp;#39;re afraid that you know North</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="3.6">Korea is gonna hit Guam well the only</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="1.98">way this is going to happen is if the</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="2.79">Cabal</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="5.22">actually does this and create this event</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="6.78">blaming it on North Korea so the Cabal</text>
  <text start="310.73" dur="6.54">had usb1 be supersonic bombers together</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="4.98">with f-35b stealth fighters and they</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="3.3">conducted a joint military exercise with</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="3.42">South Korea</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="4.56">in response to the missile launch and</text>
  <text start="323" dur="4.32">again we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen on both</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="4.77">sides they&amp;#39;re provoking each side North</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="4.26">Korea is not going to do anything except</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="3.69">continue on with the missile program</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="4.53">continue on with their nuclear program</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="4.98">because they understand that if they</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="5.16">stop there will be regime change and</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop no matter how</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="2.49">many different sanctions they place on</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="5.64">North Korea</text>
  <text start="343.76" dur="7.83">now nikki Haley she is really having a</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.76">complete meltdown right now because</text>
  <text start="351.59" dur="7.32">she&amp;#39;s saying that sedan sanctions do not</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="9.24">work against North Korea we should go to</text>
  <text start="358.91" dur="7.02">the next option that is invasion and we</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="5.49">can see that she&amp;#39;s also out there saying</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="5.79">that listen defense secretary James</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="4.92">Madison to handle the invasion he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.67">gonna handle all this and she said</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="6.87">listen we cut trade by 90 percent with</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="5.64">North Korea 30 percent of oil and I have</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="4.31">no problem kicking it to general mattis</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="6.27">because I think he has plenty of options</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="6.76">but Nicky was not done with just that</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="5.37">she&amp;#39;s also threatening a war on North</text>
  <text start="392.06" dur="5.1">Korea which again would likely leave</text>
  <text start="394.67" dur="6.38">thousands upon thousands of people dead</text>
  <text start="397.16" dur="7.89">even US troops she&amp;#39;s also talking about</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="7.51">u.s. regime change in Syria where Assad</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="7.77">should be removed he must go and she is</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="6.81">just desperately out there we Girja</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.95">tating everything that has been said in</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="5.57">the past because what we see happening</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="6.66">right now is they are losing their grip</text>
  <text start="420.94" dur="5.59">because at this point the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="4.07">just falling apart I mean think about</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="5.58">this South Korea</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="5.17">well the state-run Korean gas Corp the</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="4.89">world&amp;#39;s second largest single buyer of</text>
  <text start="433.67" dur="6.09">liquefied natural gas says its plans it</text>
  <text start="437" dur="6.78">says it plans to import natural gas from</text>
  <text start="439.76" dur="7.02">Iran so even South Korea right now is</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="5.73">going to be dealing with Iran everything</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.52">that they tried to do is completely</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="4.39">falling apart and also there was a two</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="4.209">billion contract</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="5.94">was signed with South Korea to help</text>
  <text start="456.509" dur="5.13">boost oil processing capacity and this</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="4.579">has to do with Iran and we could see</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="5.731">right now all these countries are making</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="6">deals they&amp;#39;re making deals because they</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="6.51">see that the dollar will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="7.271">the US power</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="6.36">well it&amp;#39;s disintegrating the Cabal their</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="5.16">grip is disintegrating and they realize</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.709">that they need to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="482.85" dur="4.68">now just a couple reports ago we talked</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="5.641">about how the Pentagon was supplying</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="5.639">weapons to all the paid mercenaries in</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="4.829">Iran and Syria and this report came out</text>
  <text start="493.169" dur="4.321">and the German government has opened a</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="4.801">probe into the illegal Pentagon arms</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="5.16">trafficking operation after this report</text>
  <text start="500.22" dur="5.49">was released and now they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="4.71">into it and they are trying to figure</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="3.6">out what was happening and I think a lot</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="4.32">of these nations might have been kept in</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="5.37">the dark of what was really going on and</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="6.45">how the Cabal was controlling everything</text>
  <text start="514.68" dur="5.549">and making these countries believe that</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="5.399">these were independent terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="6.181">that were actually creating terror in</text>
  <text start="523.529" dur="6">these countries but in reality guess</text>
  <text start="526.41" dur="5.51">what they were controlled funded</text>
  <text start="529.529" dur="6.031">supported by the United States and</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="7.18">certain individuals in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="5.94">agencies we see the nusra front the</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="3.87">Islamic state saying listen we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="3.69">going to give up we&amp;#39;re gonna fight to</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="4.35">the death in Syria I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="545.19" dur="3.899">right now that&amp;#39;s not going to take too</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="5.37">long because we could see that Syria and</text>
  <text start="549.089" dur="7.921">Russia they are making huge gains in</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="6.51">Syria it is almost over for the Cabal we</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="4.14">see the elite Syrian troops they have</text>
  <text start="559.2" dur="2.7">reached the east bank of Euphrates and</text>
  <text start="561.15" dur="4.35">Deir Ezzor</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="5.73">we also see large cargo planes coming in</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="4.529">from Syria they are now landing at the</text>
  <text start="567.63" dur="4.38">Deir Ezzor military airport bringing in</text>
  <text start="570.029" dur="3.631">supplies and equipment to fight the</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="3.449">Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve gained control of</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="3.869">the airport which they haven&amp;#39;t had</text>
  <text start="575.459" dur="4.111">control of the airport for a very very</text>
  <text start="577.529" dur="4.951">long time and now we see that they have</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="4.68">gained control of this entire area it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="4.5">only a matter of time I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="3.71">months right now until Syria is</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="3.72">completely</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="5.32">cleansed of the paid mercenaries the</text>
  <text start="590.7" dur="4.59">Islamic state al-nusra the Syrian</text>
  <text start="593.28" dur="4.74">democratic forces they are just being</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="4.68">strangled right now and eventually and I</text>
  <text start="598.02" dur="5.25">think this is gonna happen in the next</text>
  <text start="599.97" dur="4.26">couple of months where Russia Syria Iran</text>
  <text start="603.27" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re just gonna come out and say</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="5.64">listen there is no need for the United</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="5.97">States the coalition forces to be in</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="4.89">Syria you need to leave now and what is</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="3.51">the United States going to do at this</text>
  <text start="614.76" dur="5.04">point well they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="616.92" dur="6.69">leave because the sovereign country of</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="7.41">Syria with an elected president has</text>
  <text start="623.61" dur="6.24">removed all the terrorists and that</text>
  <text start="627.21" dur="5.7">president in Syria can say these</text>
  <text start="629.85" dur="5.37">countries are now invading our country</text>
  <text start="632.91" dur="4.32">and this is going to be a big problem</text>
  <text start="635.22" dur="3.42">because on the world stage everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.23" dur="2.1">gonna look at this and say wait what is</text>
  <text start="638.64" dur="2.94">going on right now</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s no reason for any of these</text>
  <text start="641.58" dur="3.9">countries to be there</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="5.34">and believe me China and Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="5.16">going to make a huge deal of this and</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re gonna bring it up at the UN and</text>
  <text start="650.64" dur="5.58">most of the countries are gonna say you</text>
  <text start="652.53" dur="6.51">need to leave and it&amp;#39;s game over so what</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="5.61">do we see happening right now we see the</text>
  <text start="659.04" dur="5.43">Cabal is desperate nikki Haley she is</text>
  <text start="661.83" dur="5.79">just going crazy she is part of the</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="7.11">Cabal all they have left right now is</text>
  <text start="667.62" dur="8.19">North Korea and again like we&amp;#39;ve said in</text>
  <text start="671.58" dur="6.84">the past they will push this until the</text>
  <text start="675.81" dur="3.12">very end and they are running out of</text>
  <text start="678.42" dur="2.28">time</text>
  <text start="678.93" dur="4.83">because what we see happening right now</text>

  <text start="820.41" dur="5.37">countries they are also going to do this</text>
  <text start="823.47" dur="5.01">because they&amp;#39;re part of the BRICS system</text>
  <text start="825.78" dur="6.65">and we starting to see how this is all</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="7.2">coming together now and once the dollar</text>
  <text start="832.43" dur="4.78">starts to fall apart and is devalued and</text>
  <text start="835.68" dur="3.78">these dollars float back to the United</text>
  <text start="837.21" dur="4.56">States we&amp;#39;re going to see thing we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="844.53" dur="4.23">that time period and this is why you</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="3.93">need to be prepared now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="848.76" dur="3.18">get rid of your dollars I&amp;#39;m saying you</text>
  <text start="850.68" dur="2.73">should hold some of these dollars</text>
  <text start="851.94" dur="3.149">outside of the banking system because</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="4.169">again they still have</text>
  <text start="855.089" dur="4.891">plans to make it look like we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="857.579" dur="4.68">attacked somehow some way this is their</text>
  <text start="859.98" dur="3.959">plans they&amp;#39;re still in place and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.259" dur="2.82">going to freeze the banking system this</text>
  <text start="863.939" dur="1.741">is why they created the bail in</text>
  <text start="865.079" dur="3.211">documents</text>
  <text start="865.68" dur="5.069">remember those they didn&amp;#39;t create them</text>
  <text start="868.29" dur="5.219">for no reason they&amp;#39;re going to use them</text>
  <text start="870.749" dur="4.44">so you&amp;#39;re going to need the dollars to</text>
  <text start="873.509" dur="3.81">hold you&amp;#39;re gonna need them to hold on</text>
  <text start="875.189" dur="3.601">to because once the system comes down</text>
  <text start="877.319" dur="3.721">you&amp;#39;re gonna use that first you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="878.79" dur="3.87">go out and say okay as prices go up</text>
  <text start="881.04" dur="3.51">actually as the value of the dollar goes</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="3.029">down you&amp;#39;re gonna have to pay with cash</text>
  <text start="884.55" dur="4.019">once</text>
  <text start="885.689" dur="5.491">nobody has cash anymore well you might</text>
  <text start="888.569" dur="4.351">go into the barter type of system where</text>
  <text start="891.18" dur="4.469">listen I have toilet paper I&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="5.43">that meat once that breaks down you</text>
  <text start="895.649" dur="5.701">might go into maybe gold and silver or</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="5.25">you might combine both of them but you</text>
  <text start="901.35" dur="3.33">can see that you&amp;#39;re going to need all of</text>
  <text start="903.6" dur="2.52">us and actually you&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="3.06">supplies and I&amp;#39;m not saying this is</text>
  <text start="906.12" dur="3.18">gonna happen in a month and the next</text>
  <text start="907.74" dur="4.5">week you&amp;#39;re gonna go to barter this will</text>
  <text start="909.3" dur="6.539">be a long period of time so if you have</text>
  <text start="912.24" dur="5.449">like $100 or $200 in cash on hand</text>
  <text start="915.839" dur="3.87">I would ramp that up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="917.689" dur="4.9">try to get as much silver as you</text>
  <text start="919.709" dur="4.86">possibly can even have crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="922.589" dur="3.151">because when the system comes online we</text>
  <text start="924.569" dur="3.21">know that they&amp;#39;re gonna be moving to a</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="4.439">crypto type of system a blockchain</text>
  <text start="927.779" dur="4.92">technology to trade currency it might be</text>
  <text start="930.179" dur="3.78">backed by silver we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="932.699" dur="5.25">but it&amp;#39;s nice to have all your bases</text>
  <text start="933.959" dur="7.891">covered so you need to have the supplies</text>
  <text start="937.949" dur="6.661">in your home protected because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="5.76">going to serve two purposes one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="5.669">going to help you survive the other you</text>
  <text start="947.61" dur="4.349">can use it for bartering and also you</text>
  <text start="950.279" dur="4.711">can help your friends your family if</text>
  <text start="951.959" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t have much and this is why</text>
  <text start="954.99" dur="5.069">we&amp;#39;ve been preparing for a very long</text>
