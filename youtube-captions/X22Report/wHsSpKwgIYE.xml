  <text start="294.66" dur="3.69">block parts of the report from the</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="4.08">public disclosure there are two types of</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="3.66">executive privilege the first is the</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="3.84">presidential communications privilege</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="3.5">which pertains to conversations or other</text>
  <text start="304.2" dur="3.48">communication personally involved</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.27">involving the president either with the</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="4.35">White House staff or with other senior</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="5.34">administration officials the second is</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="4.86">the deliberative process privilege a</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="4.71">lesser and weaker form of privilege</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="4.53">which involves deliberations of anyone</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="2.58">in the executive branch discussing</text>
  <text start="321.42" dur="3.15">sensitive matters</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="3.54">for both forms of privilege including</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="3.21">the second one which by definition</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="3.15">covers communications where the</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="3.71">president was not personally involved</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="4.62">only the president can assert privilege</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="5.23">not only did President Trump never</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="5.43">assert executive privilege here he did</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.62">not even request an advance copy of the</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="4.56">report to consider whether to assert</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="4.53">privilege over any part of it</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="3.86">the president decided to to be fully</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="4.53">transparent on the report without</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="6.16">knowing what was in it and Barr was</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="5.61">being right up front explaining to</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="4.92">everyone why there are certain parts</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="5.51">redacted why he decided to give it to</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="6.21">Congress why he decided to do this and</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="5.11">saying that we are not hiding anything</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="3.45">and you can see Barr and Trump there</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.9">being completely transparent and cues</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.859">letting us know that this is the only</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="5.61">way we can go forward the truth being</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="5.821">completely transparent and we need to go</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="4.68">back in time a little bit because if you</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="2.99">look back in time a lot of the things</text>
