  <text start="53.4" dur="5.52">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.36" dur="5.07">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="6.27">episode 1374 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="5.01">September 9th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="65.19" dur="6.45">the episode is North Korea can withstand</text>
  <text start="67.44" dur="6.48">an embargo is the Cabal finished let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="5.04">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="5.13">and geopolitical news now Mueller is</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="3.99">pushing his investigation and he wants</text>
  <text start="79.05" dur="4.35">to start interviewing the six members of</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="4.89">trumps inner circle and these are</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="5.04">certain individuals like Sean Spicer</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="4.59">Reince Priebus and the rest of them and</text>
  <text start="88.44" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s looking to find out some</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="4.95">information and basically he wants to</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="4.26">find out information about James Comey</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="4.2">&amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s firing now they&amp;#39;re just going all</text>
  <text start="97.08" dur="4.26">over the place looking to find out you</text>
  <text start="99.3" dur="3.569">know anything they possibly can they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="3.48">looking at financial records they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="3.451">looking pretty much at everything really</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="4.62">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.65">really can&amp;#39;t find anything about this</text>
  <text start="109.44" dur="3.87">Russian collusion and that&amp;#39;s why Mueller</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="4.32">is actually there where he&amp;#39;s looking to</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="3.419">find information about Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="3.18">and he&amp;#39;s looking in all different</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="4.411">directions trying to find things and at</text>
  <text start="118.47" dur="5.7">this point there is really nothing there</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="5.7">and this is why he&amp;#39;s scrambling to talk</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="4.65">to other individuals see what they have</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.14">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that all this</text>
  <text start="128.82" dur="3.21">stuff it is just completely falling</text>
  <text start="130.98" dur="2.88">apart and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.53">happen is that he&amp;#39;ll find nothing</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;ll be a report he&amp;#39;ll be put out</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="3.36">there and there&amp;#39;ll be nothing about this</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="5.909">Russian collusion because as we know</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="6.45">from Veritas Project Veritas money they</text>
  <text start="144.269" dur="3.421">went undercover all these individuals</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="3.63">said yeah this Russian collusion thing</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="5.19">completely it is made-up it is a nothing</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.26">burger and there is nothing to be found</text>
  <text start="152.88" dur="4.65">from this now we see there was another</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="5.37">data hack and this was with Equifax and</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;ve confessed that yes that some of</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="5.34">the stolen data is name social security</text>
  <text start="162.239" dur="5.161">number birth dates some credit card</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="3.93">information and they saying about two</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="4.38">hundred nine thousand credit card</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="4.68">numbers were accessed and we could see</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="5.55">at this point and we need to understand</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="6.42">why is this all happening well we have</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="5.07">to remember that the CIA from all their</text>
  <text start="180" dur="5.67">tools from vault seven they&amp;#39;ve left</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="4.59">backdoors and when you have a backdoor</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="3.42">where</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="4.14">you can access the information you know</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve modified computer systems they</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="4.68">modified chips they place software in</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="4.38">the operating systems and when you do</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="5.82">this and you leave backdoors hackers</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="7.44">will find these backdoors and they will</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="6.57">use them because the companies and those</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.61">tech teams they don&amp;#39;t realize that these</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="4.14">do exist they think they&amp;#39;re securing</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="4.5">everything and I remember when I was</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="5.58">working for a major banking system where</text>
  <text start="215.61" dur="3.96">you had no clue that something was</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="3.21">embedded in a chip or there was a</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="4.17">malware sitting there because you can do</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="4.71">a scan and if the CIA has control over</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="3.39">all this the scan will not show you</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="3.54">anything especially if something is</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="4.65">embedded in chip it will definitely not</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="4.77">pick it up and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.2">that as they&amp;#39;ve been opening up</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="3.84">backdoors all over to these all these</text>
  <text start="235.98" dur="4.47">different systems you&amp;#39;re gonna see more</text>
  <text start="237.99" dur="6.39">of these type of hacks and who is</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="7.2">responsible well the CIA we see the US</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="5.37">wants the UN to vote on sanctions and</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re looking to do this on Monday and</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="4.71">basically what they want to do with</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="5.82">China with South Korea they want some</text>
  <text start="254.46" dur="4.68">type of oil embargo they want an embargo</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="4.65">on North Korea but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="5.19">interesting about this embargo is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="5">not gonna really work because North</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="5.82">Korea over the many many years they have</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="6.61">basically preparing their entire country</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="6.09">to be self-sufficient and a report is</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="5.16">out there saying that a full-scale oil</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="6.15">embargo against North Korea is unlikely</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="8.42">and it will unlikely work because North</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="7.62">Korea they have a huge amount of oil</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="5.77">reserves and they&amp;#39;ve been building this</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="6.09">up over time with many other supplies to</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="6">be self-sufficient and in addition to</text>
  <text start="296.1" dur="4.32">the large reserves of domestic coal and</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="3.39">the increased reliance on green energy</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="3.93">in the form of hydroelectric power</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="4.74">North Korea&amp;#39;s domestic oil reserves are</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="5.76">likely far greater than previous</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="5.25">conservative estimates have indicated so</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="6">all this talk about placing these</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="6.45">embargoes most likely will not have an</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="4.35">effect on North Korea whatsoever now of</text>
  <text start="318.66" dur="3.78">course the corporate media and everyone</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="4.2">else wants you to believe that this will</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="4.8">have an effect but I don&amp;#39;t think so at</text>
  <text start="324.66" dur="4.59">this point and placing more sanctions on</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="4.609">countries it really doesn&amp;#39;t work because</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="6.9">they always find a way around this and</text>
  <text start="331.849" dur="6.341">we can see from Cuba from Syria to Iran</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.62">where they had sanctions on them for</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="6.449">many many years guess what they survived</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="7.47">it doesn&amp;#39;t work now China they are</text>
  <text start="344.639" dur="5.34">lodging a protest with South South Korea</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="3.63">over the deployment of THAAD launchers</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="3.03">and we know why that that launchers are</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="2.82">being brought into South Korea has</text>
  <text start="353.009" dur="3.72">nothing to do with North Korea this has</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="4.62">to do with the build-up of military</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="5.671">assets in South Korea pointing it to</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.32">China and Russia because eventually what</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="3.42">they really wanted to do and this is</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="4.53">going back a little bit in time is they</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="5.129">wanted to have a war with China and</text>
  <text start="368.16" dur="5.22">Russia this was the plan to bring us to</text>
  <text start="370.949" dur="6.451">a war to cover up this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="6.45">but as we can see this is all really</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="4.5">falling apart because what do we see</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="3.45">happening here whatever they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="3.509">with North Korea right now trying to</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="3.359">provoke North Korea it is not working</text>
  <text start="385.409" dur="2.671">they&amp;#39;re not going to stop their missile</text>
  <text start="386.639" dur="3.511">program they&amp;#39;re not going to stop their</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="4.26">nuclear program sanctions aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="4.739">to work embargo is not going to work the</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="5.22">Cabal is pretty much finished right now</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="5.131">unless they have some type of major</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="4.02">event right now where they blow this</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="3.57">thing wide open which they still might</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="3.929">do we&amp;#39;re still looking at this we can</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="4.049">see that they haven&amp;#39;t given up unless</text>
  <text start="405.509" dur="4.261">they do something like this they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re finished there&amp;#39;s nothing left</text>
  <text start="409.77" dur="5.85">for them to do we see the u.s. they</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="5.28">approved arm sales worth over 3.8</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="4.639">billion to Bahrain and we can see right</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="5.22">now the package of the weapons include</text>
  <text start="420.259" dur="7.15">f-16 fighters upgrade to missiles patrol</text>
  <text start="423.479" dur="5.641">boats and we can see that they are still</text>
  <text start="427.409" dur="3.301">selling weapons to all these countries</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="3.599">that human that have human rights</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="4.049">violations and the United States has</text>
  <text start="432.719" dur="4.29">been doing this for quite a while we see</text>
  <text start="434.759" dur="4.891">UN troops they&amp;#39;re going to arrive in</text>
  <text start="437.009" dur="5.371">Libya now they&amp;#39;re bringing in about 250</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="5.67">UN troops they will arrive there and</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="5.129">they are expect to carry out activities</text>
  <text start="445.32" dur="4.2">and of course they&amp;#39;re not letting anyone</text>
  <text start="447.509" dur="5.13">know what these activities are and most</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.6">likely it&amp;#39;s to protect the un-backed</text>
  <text start="452.639" dur="3.34">government that they put into</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="4.41">place in Libya because what we see</text>
  <text start="455.979" dur="5.581">happening right now that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="5.46">want a government that was picked for</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.23">them they want to elect a government and</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="3.78">this is why there&amp;#39;s huge amount of</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="3.689">problem in Libya now remember trump has</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="4.59">said that we&amp;#39;re not getting involved in</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="4.921">Libya and we can see out in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="4.89">many other countries a lot of these</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="4.89">countries are working especially general</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="5.01">Hoffner in Libya is working with Russia</text>
  <text start="479.29" dur="5.67">Iraq is working with Iran and Russia we</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="4.02">see Syria working with Russia and we can</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="3.9">see that all of these Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="4.77">countries they&amp;#39;re turning away from the</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="4.38">United States they don&amp;#39;t want the puppet</text>
  <text start="491.05" dur="5.36">regimes and everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="6.63">fall apart now it has been confirmed</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="6.7">right now and it&amp;#39;s pretty much 100% true</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="4.95">that the United States the Cabal they</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="3.66">were evacuating the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="504.82" dur="5.01">leaders now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="7.259">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we have evidence</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="5.31">of this and Trump should investigate why</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="4.95">this is happening</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="6.569">who is airlifting these paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="518.979" dur="4.531">these terrorists out of the country now</text>
  <text start="521.709" dur="4.141">let&amp;#39;s see what Trump does at this point</text>
  <text start="523.51" dur="4.46">because he should investigate why is the</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="6.42">United States helping paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="6.369">terrorists to escape from Syria when</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="3.509">they told us they were the bad guys well</text>
  <text start="534.339" dur="2.881">we know we&amp;#39;ve been talking about it for</text>
  <text start="535.779" dur="4.141">a very long time we know the United</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="4.59">States the Cabal supported and created</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="3.48">these paid mercenaries and I think at</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.469">this point the United States needs to</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="6.42">look into this and see exactly who is</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="5.791">involved in this we see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="4.44">army has begun their operation Assad</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="4.56">leap it looks like they&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="4.29">the Deir Ezzor Airport this is a</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="3.84">military airport and it looks like</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re having this major offensive to</text>
  <text start="560.47" dur="3.63">free the military airport and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="2.4">think they&amp;#39;re gonna actually have a</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="2.76">problem I think they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="565.33" dur="3.27">do it with absolutely no problem because</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.169">what we see happening in Syria is that</text>
  <text start="568.6" dur="5.609">Russian the Syrian forces they are</text>
  <text start="571.029" dur="5.761">clearing out the area completely the red</text>
  <text start="574.209" dur="5.701">crosses out in Syria saying listen the</text>
  <text start="576.79" dur="6.69">Russian Syrian de-escalation zones they</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="5.469">are working violence is way way down and</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="4.629">people feel</text>
  <text start="585.379" dur="5.13">safe they are returning to Syria the</text>
  <text start="588.109" dur="4.41">refugees are coming back now hundreds of</text>
  <text start="590.509" dur="3.84">thousands of people are coming back and</text>
  <text start="592.519" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re saying that these zones are</text>
  <text start="594.349" dur="4.53">actually working because they have the</text>
  <text start="597.259" dur="3.87">military police they&amp;#39;re protecting these</text>
  <text start="598.879" dur="4.17">people and it is safe now this is</text>
  <text start="601.129" dur="3.36">completely opposite of what the United</text>
  <text start="603.049" dur="4.77">States wanted to do and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="604.489" dur="5.16">about the Cabal they wanted these no fly</text>
  <text start="607.819" dur="4.17">zones which they kept changing the name</text>
  <text start="609.649" dur="4.59">you know safe zones no-fly zones where</text>
  <text start="611.989" dur="4.17">they wanted to destroy all the planes of</text>
  <text start="614.239" dur="4.05">the Syrian army just like they did in</text>
  <text start="616.159" dur="3.21">Libya to make sure that there&amp;#39;s no fly</text>
  <text start="618.289" dur="3.39">zones around the area</text>
  <text start="619.369" dur="5.43">these are de-escalation zones where the</text>
  <text start="621.679" dur="4.89">people are safe in these areas where</text>
  <text start="624.799" dur="4.38">they keep out the terrorists and they</text>
  <text start="626.569" dur="4.17">set up a perimeter to make sure that</text>
  <text start="629.179" dur="3.78">none of these terrorists are able to get</text>
  <text start="630.739" dur="5.58">in there and get back into these areas</text>
  <text start="632.959" dur="6.66">and hurt the families the women the</text>
  <text start="636.319" dur="4.89">children the men and we see that this is</text>
  <text start="639.619" dur="4.41">actually working in the Red Cross is</text>
  <text start="641.209" dur="5.37">saying that yes this does work we see</text>
  <text start="644.029" dur="4.86">that Russia the United States and Jordan</text>
  <text start="646.579" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;ve reached an agreement which will</text>
  <text start="648.889" dur="5.73">allow the Syrian army to take control of</text>
  <text start="651.35" dur="6.029">virtually all militant-held southern</text>
  <text start="654.619" dur="5.22">Syria on the border of Jordan and</text>
  <text start="657.379" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re taking I think something like</text>
  <text start="659.839" dur="6.12">control over 900 key points there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="663.769" dur="6.24">one area which they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="665.959" dur="7.46">control is the tamp base with Iraq but</text>
  <text start="670.009" dur="6.45">we can see right now that Syria Russia</text>
  <text start="673.419" dur="5.77">they are controlling their borders the</text>
  <text start="676.459" dur="5.43">Islamic state they are doomed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.189" dur="4.95">stuck in the middle of Syria there is no</text>
  <text start="681.889" dur="4.62">way out supplies are not coming in and</text>
  <text start="684.139" dur="5.31">we see at this point the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="686.509" dur="5.58">finished in this area it&amp;#39;s just a matter</text>
  <text start="689.449" dur="4.2">of months where Syria and Russia is</text>
  <text start="692.089" dur="3.54">going to take complete control of the</text>
  <text start="693.649" dur="4.56">entire country the United States will be</text>
  <text start="695.629" dur="4.86">forced out the coalition forces will be</text>
  <text start="698.209" dur="5.1">forced out they&amp;#39;ll take full control of</text>
  <text start="700.489" dur="5.01">their borders and the Cabal their dream</text>
  <text start="703.309" dur="4.35">of a pipeline going through Syria taking</text>
  <text start="705.499" dur="4.98">control of Syria then going into Iran</text>
  <text start="707.659" dur="4.65">well this has come to an end so what</text>
  <text start="710.479" dur="4.92">does the Cabal have left</text>
  <text start="712.309" dur="4.35">they have Venezuela and we see Venezuela</text>
  <text start="715.399" dur="2.28">they&amp;#39;re going to get around the</text>
  <text start="716.659" dur="2.231">sanctions because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="717.679" dur="3.371">bypass the</text>
  <text start="718.89" dur="4.08">and this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="721.05" dur="4.44">and we see North Korea now the only</text>
  <text start="722.97" dur="6.66">thing they can do at this point is to</text>
  <text start="725.49" dur="5.73">create some type of major event and they</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="4.59">are running out of time because if</text>
  <text start="731.22" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s some type of diplomatic solution</text>
  <text start="734.22" dur="7.35">in North Korea guess what they are done</text>
  <text start="737.46" dur="8">for if Russia and China are able to</text>
  <text start="741.57" dur="7.2">formulate some type of agreement the</text>
  <text start="745.46" dur="5.38">Cabal is completely finished and</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;ll be nothing left for them to do</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="4.32">yes can they have some type of major</text>
  <text start="752.49" dur="5.28">event well it looks like this still</text>
  <text start="755.16" dur="4.98">could happen where they say maybe North</text>
  <text start="757.77" dur="4.47">Korea&amp;#39;s cyber attacked the United States</text>
  <text start="760.14" dur="3.57">but once that diplomatic agreement is</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="4.11">made I don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="763.71" dur="5.97">pull this off so if we get close to a</text>
  <text start="766.35" dur="5.55">diplomatic solution we know that the</text>
  <text start="769.68" dur="3.93">Cabal they&amp;#39;re gonna pull out all the</text>
  <text start="771.9" dur="4.83">stops and have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="5.46">because they really have nothing left so</text>
  <text start="776.73" dur="4.83">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re watching now</text>
  <text start="779.07" dur="4.83">to see exactly what they do</text>
  <text start="781.56" dur="5.03">remember the economy is falling apart</text>
  <text start="783.9" dur="5.04">now countries are bypassing the dollar</text>
  <text start="786.59" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re running out of time time is</text>
  <text start="788.94" dur="5.31">ticking down right now and the economy</text>
  <text start="791.88" dur="4.05">is deteriorating and as we move into</text>
  <text start="794.25" dur="3.69">this fall to this holiday season it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="5.16">just going to get worse it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="797.94" dur="5.25">to improve and they can&amp;#39;t wait too long</text>
  <text start="801.09" dur="4.86">because if they do guess who gets blamed</text>
  <text start="803.19" dur="4.62">the central bank and they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="805.95" dur="4.26">be blamed because they want to restart</text>
  <text start="807.81" dur="4.8">the system so this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="810.21" dur="4.68">watching right now the clock is ticking</text>
  <text start="812.61" dur="3.54">down and we can see they don&amp;#39;t have many</text>
  <text start="814.89" dur="2.88">options left</text>
