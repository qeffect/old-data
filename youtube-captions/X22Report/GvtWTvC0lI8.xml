  <text start="226.21" dur="3.66">not based on how well companies are</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="4.41">doing we know that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="6.06">manipulating so when we look around who</text>

  <text start="235.93" dur="4.86">economic data it&amp;#39;s the US government</text>
  <text start="239.02" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s the central bank as the shadow</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="5.28">government and if we look back in time</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="7.21">we can see the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="6.21">US government continually always gave us</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="5.819">fake news remember when George W Bush</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="10.2">came out and said that ooh Iraq has</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="10.051">weapons of mass destruction well did</text>
  <text start="262.48" dur="7.62">they know they didn&amp;#39;t that was</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="5.76">completely fake we see on August fifth</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="4.11">nineteen sixty four the New York Times</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="4.71">reporter President Johnson has ordered</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="5.13">retaliatory action against gunboats and</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="5.94">certain supporting facilities in North</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="5.27">Vietnam after renewed attacks against</text>
  <text start="282.67" dur="5.52">American destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="6.04">but it wasn&amp;#39;t true at all in fact the</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="4.47">Gulf and talkin incident has it become</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="6.15">as became known turn out to be</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="6.72">fictitious created by the government to</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="6.78">escalate the war in Vietnam just</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="7.16">recently a destroyer off the coast of</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="7.77">Yemen said that the Hootie&amp;#39;s were firing</text>
  <text start="306.54" dur="6.7">missiles at the ship and the US</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="5.039">destroyer had a fire back and hit the</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="6.19">radar sites in Yemen and it</text>
  <text start="316.389" dur="6.121">well maybe they really didn&amp;#39;t fire</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="6.26">missiles at us maybe our systems</text>
  <text start="322.51" dur="7.57">malfunctioned and we thought they did</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="8.68">again another fake story to push their</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="6.78">agenda there was a time on Fox News when</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="6.6">they hired a CIA operative who wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="6.69">CIA operative Wayne Shelby Simon&amp;#39;s made</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="5.64">a guest appearance on Fox News as a</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="6.72">security expert with insider expertise</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="9.05">from his work as a CIA operative and it</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="5.39">turns out that he was an impostor and</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="4.3">his lies caught up with him he was</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="6.24">arrested and he was sentenced to 33</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="8.52">months in prison more fake news look at</text>
  <text start="364.7" dur="7.41">911 one of the biggest fake news jobs</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="5.43">that is out there right now so when we</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="4.79">talk about fake news we need to look</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="4.8">closely at what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="6.28">actually you know it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="8.25">is that they&amp;#39;re asking for a pardon for</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="7.65">Snowden and Obama came out and he said</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="6.2">well you know I can&amp;#39;t pardon somebody</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="5.58">who hasn&amp;#39;t gone before a court and</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="5.26">presented himself so that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="396.41" dur="4.92">something that I would comment on at</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="6.719">this point he said well this is</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="5.64">completely incorrect because as it is</text>
  <text start="405.289" dur="3.5">known to anyone who remembers the fact</text>
  <text start="406.97" dur="5.73">that Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="5.651">before he had been indicted and it</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="4.5">appears that the president knows this</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="6.09">because as the part as the pardon stone</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="6.54">campaign points out Obama pardon three</text>
  <text start="420.53" dur="6.9">Iranian Americans who had not yet stood</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.15">trial and that happened this year so for</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="4.56">him to say it&amp;#39;s impossible to pardon</text>
  <text start="429.89" dur="7.26">someone who hasn&amp;#39;t gone before the court</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="7.62">is simply a lie and then we have the</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="5.61">Supreme Court they had a ruling that</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="5.76">makes this abundantly clear 150 years</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="5.31">ago in the ruling of ex parte garland</text>
  <text start="445.37" dur="4.769">the Supreme Court stated the power of</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="4.409">pardon conferred by the concert</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="5.46">tution upon the president is unlimited</text>
  <text start="452.479" dur="5.94">except in cases of impeachment it</text>
  <text start="455.599" dur="5.641">extends to every offense known to the</text>
  <text start="458.419" dur="5.4">law and may be exercised at any time</text>
  <text start="461.24" dur="4.35">after its commission either before legal</text>
  <text start="463.819" dur="3.81">proceedings are taking ordering their</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="4.919">pendency or after conviction and</text>
  <text start="467.629" dur="5.611">judgment the power is not subject to</text>
  <text start="470.509" dur="5.851">legislative control and what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="6.12">saying is that listen anyone that is a</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="5.13">whistleblower be where you&amp;#39;ll be going</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="4.829">to jail and most likely you&amp;#39;ll never be</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="6.72">seen again and this is why he won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.189" dur="7.051">pardon Snowden we understand that paid</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="5.699">protesters that belonged to source</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="4.5">organization Hillary&amp;#39;s organization the</text>
  <text start="493.909" dur="3.51">deep state the globalists they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="497.419" dur="5.87">inauguration for Trump in January but</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="5.669">before that what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="5.171">they&amp;#39;re trying to flip electors right</text>
  <text start="506.509" dur="4.68">now because what they want to do and</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="5.639">this is within the law they want</text>
  <text start="511.189" dur="6.361">electors before December nineteenth to</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="5.701">change their votes so they want those</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="5.039">numbers that were seeing right now from</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="5.34">the electoral college to change they</text>
  <text start="522.589" dur="7.711">wanted even they wanted to make it even</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="7.559">with Trump so there&amp;#39;s a tie or make it a</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="4.56">little bit more than Trump to say okay</text>
  <text start="532.699" dur="3.961">look look what happened before December</text>

  <text start="541.82" dur="4.47">the popular vote that&amp;#39;s really who it</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="3.45">should go with that&amp;#39;s step one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="3.6">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="6.39">before December nineteenth if that</text>
  <text start="549.89" dur="7.62">doesn&amp;#39;t work well then they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="8.759">try to maybe incapacitate maybe even</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="8.699">assassinate Donald Trump before this</text>
  <text start="562.519" dur="6.541">period of December nineteenth if this</text>
  <text start="566.209" dur="6.591">doesn&amp;#39;t work they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="7.019">create civil unrest in the country</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="5.979">during inauguration they want a civil</text>
  <text start="576.079" dur="7.331">war and this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing so</text>
  <text start="578.779" dur="6.85">hard for this this is why they want this</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="4.289">during this time this is why you see an</text>
  <text start="585.629" dur="4.26">ads on Craigslist this is why you see it</text>
  <text start="587.699" dur="3.541">on Facebook where they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="589.889" dur="4.411">as many people as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="4.95">together they want people to join they</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="3.659">want the hate to flow and this is why</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="4.98">the corporate media is continually</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="5.94">pushing this out to the public and</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="6.089">remember all the hate all the rioting</text>
  <text start="603.899" dur="5.88">all the protests are not coming from the</text>
  <text start="607.259" dur="4.981">Trump Organization it&amp;#39;s actually coming</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="4.41">from the people who want Hillary as</text>
  <text start="612.24" dur="3.69">president but again most of these are</text>
  <text start="614.189" dur="5.01">agent provocateurs professional</text>
  <text start="615.93" dur="6.029">protesters trying to bring in others to</text>

  <text start="621.959" dur="5.521">build on this we see Britain has just</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="6.75">passed the snooper charter ending all</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="7.2">privacy now the new legislation that was</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="4.649">just introduced establishes the legal</text>
