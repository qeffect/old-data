  <text start="76.47" dur="4.83">everything that is happening right now</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="4.83">is in the background and soon it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="4.26">to be in the foreground and people are</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="4.05">going to be absolutely shocked and we</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="4.05">can see out in Greece that things are</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="6.15">rapidly falling apart Greece is lashing</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="6.48">out at the IMF we see that the EU and</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.89">the IMF well they&amp;#39;re looking at Greece</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="4.35">saying this is a tough situation right</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="3.839">now German Finance Minister Wolfgang shy</text>
  <text start="100.44" dur="4.14">blue went on TV saying the only way</text>
  <text start="102.149" dur="5.76">Greece can get a haircut is if it leaves</text>
  <text start="104.58" dur="6.239">the eurozone at this point yes I think</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="4.681">we should leave the eurozone I think all</text>
  <text start="110.819" dur="5.461">the countries should leave the eurozone</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="5.459">right now and the IMF continually read</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.92">it reiterates that Greece will not be</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="6.901">able to make its payments and Greece</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="6.239">insists that the IMF is wrong well</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="5.94">what&amp;#39;s happening here is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="5.851">battle going on and they know that if</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.36">Greece receives more debt there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="6.18">to be more austerity and they will</text>
  <text start="136.25" dur="5.29">completely implode this country central</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="6">banks don&amp;#39;t want to implode the country</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="6.06">they want to keep them at a state where</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re still functioning they still</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="3">could make some of the payments but they</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="2.82">need to sell off their assets that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="4.02">what the central bank&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="4.289">want and this is what they do to every</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="3.179">single country and really think about</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="3.181">this the greek unemployment right now is</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="3.571">twenty-three percent and then telling us</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="4.29">that it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s recovering this</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="6.45">is not a recovery I mean youth</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="6.45">unemployment is above forty percent this</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="4.35">is nowhere near of recovery whatsoever</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="5.34">but we&amp;#39;re seeing that things are not</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="5.219">just getting worse out in Europe things</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="3.77">are really breaking down here in the</text>
  <text start="177.389" dur="3.501">United States</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="5.01">and one of the things that we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="7.38">at right now is the Midwest farm bubble</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="5.85">it is collapsing right now now early in</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="4.14">the week the US Department of</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="6.87">Agriculture released its biannual report</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="6.45">on farm incomes and this paints a very</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="5.43">very bleak picture of the American</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="7.22">farmer in its first forecast for 2017</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="6.71">the USDA CS real farm cash receipts down</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="5.08">fourteen percent versus 2015 and</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="6.18">thirty-six percent from the previous</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="7.83">high set in 2012 because farm debt is</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="7.39">soaring and leverage surges to all-time</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="6.84">highs this is a very terrible situation</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.19">for the american farm and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="5.07">seeing right now is there is a deadly</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="6.72">combination of rising import in input</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="6.3">costs lower grain prices strong dollar</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="5.78">and excessive leverage will likely force</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="8">many of the America&amp;#39;s Midwest farmers</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="7.96">completely out of business in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="5.29">the US farmers showed the fewest acres</text>
  <text start="248.33" dur="6.09">of winter wheat the season in more than</text>
  <text start="250.49" dur="6.119">a century American farmer share of the</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="4.77">global trade has fallen from sixty-five</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="6.601">percent in the mid-70s to thirty percent</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="5.85">today corn prices once varied</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="4.62">year-to-year by less than one dollar a</text>
  <text start="265.04" dur="4.94">bushel since 2006 they have shot up and</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="4.32">dropped more than four dollars a bushel</text>
  <text start="269.98" dur="5.5">so where does this leave the American</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="7.11">former well real farm incomes in 2017</text>
  <text start="275.48" dur="6.15">are expected to sink below 2010 levels</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="6.29">which represents a thirty-six percent</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="6.48">decline and this is completely awful and</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="6.48">this does not look good and farm debt</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="7.62">continually Rises and we can see that</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="5.92">what&amp;#39;s happening here is in every</text>
  <text start="295.73" dur="4.23">economic sector in the United States</text>
  <text start="297.95" dur="4.47">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at each one of</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="4.83">them are deteriorating and imploding on</text>
  <text start="302.42" dur="3.8">themselves things are getting worse and</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="4.439">worse they&amp;#39;re not getting better and</text>
  <text start="306.22" dur="5.789">this is supposed to be the recovery we</text>
  <text start="309.229" dur="5.21">see the student debt bubble well there</text>
  <text start="312.009" dur="4.65">major problems there now of course they</text>
  <text start="314.439" dur="3.63">make it seem like they&amp;#39;re the the debt</text>
  <text start="316.659" dur="5.581">bubble and the student loan market</text>
  <text start="318.069" dur="6.35">cannot pop but when students cannot pay</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="4.799">their student loans remember they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="4.3">declare bankruptcy they the big it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="5.1">against the law Clinton signed this into</text>
  <text start="328.719" dur="5.97">law and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because if</text>
  <text start="332.139" dur="4.95">they can&amp;#39;t pay they can&amp;#39;t pay if they</text>
  <text start="334.689" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t pay guess what the government is</text>
  <text start="337.089" dur="5.28">not receiving the funds that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="339.909" dur="4.23">complete destruction of the student loan</text>
  <text start="342.369" dur="4.681">market and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="344.139" dur="5.43">delinquencies are going up people who</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.679">can&amp;#39;t pay of going up and is getting</text>
  <text start="349.569" dur="6.27">worse and worse over time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="9.12">improving we see that the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.839" dur="11.341">largest container carrier had a huge</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="10.081">loss and this is gigantic and this is AP</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="6">moller-maersk and their loss is two</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="5.4">point six seven billion in the fourth</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="6.779">quarter and a loss of 1.9 billion for</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="8.309">the year of 2016 its first annual loss</text>
  <text start="379.959" dur="6.3">since 2009 and at that time shipping</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="5.101">came to a standstill during the global</text>
  <text start="386.259" dur="6.69">financial crisis and its second loss</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="7.229">since world war two and this is supposed</text>
  <text start="392.949" dur="6.9">to be the recovery this is not a</text>
  <text start="396.969" dur="5.49">recovery this and this economy the</text>
  <text start="399.849" dur="4.68">global economy has been built on an</text>
  <text start="402.459" dur="4.86">illusion and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="404.529" dur="6.12">as we can see the illusion is starting</text>
  <text start="407.319" dur="6.09">to rapidly fall apart we saw it so I</text>
  <text start="410.649" dur="7.531">mean as we looked at everything we saw</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="7.081">it started in retail and it started to</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="4.65">spread more stores one out of business</text>
  <text start="420.49" dur="5.219">they had to manipulate the unemployment</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="4.47">market GDP wasn&amp;#39;t doing as well so they</text>
  <text start="425.709" dur="4.14">started to move in it manipulate that</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="5.789">where they went back in time to 1929</text>
  <text start="429.849" dur="6.271">they report casted added in research and</text>
  <text start="433.089" dur="6.12">development they continually manipulated</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="7.319">numbers they added in Obamacare expenses</text>
  <text start="439.209" dur="5.79">and they completely manipulated all that</text>
  <text start="443.439" dur="2.321">but they couldn&amp;#39;t even get it above</text>
  <text start="444.999" dur="3.191">three</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="4.37">and I mean it was an average of like 1.5</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="5.28">or one-point-eight percent or so and</text>
  <text start="450.13" dur="5.44">retail continually deteriorated housing</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="5.96">now is the tier rating prices are coming</text>
  <text start="455.57" dur="7.02">down and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="4.96">things are rapidly falling apart tax</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="3.57">receipts as we know they have been</text>
  <text start="464.39" dur="3.18">falling and declining over the years the</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="3.09">federal tax receipts the state tax</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="4.47">receipts the same thing so we know the</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="4.29">unemployment numbers are not real and I</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="2.79">know that Trump has been out there and</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="3.93">he&amp;#39;s saying that these jobs are coming</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="4.89">back to the United States but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="4.35">seeing right now is all the companies</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="5.06">that promised that they were going to</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="6.54">bring the jobs back well they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="504.41" dur="5.67">bring the jobs back here well guess what</text>
  <text start="507.43" dur="4.78">their plans to move them back to Mexico</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="5.76">still in the works they&amp;#39;re still doing</text>

  <text start="519.229" dur="4.771">their plans yes they came out in public</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="8.67">and said this is what we&amp;#39;re doing but</text>
  <text start="524" dur="8.28">beyond that they&amp;#39;re not doing it Nucor</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="5.22">North Carolina steel producers who</text>

  <text start="546.77" dur="8.4">still to go to Mexico and we can see</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="6.93">right now this was a publicity stunt by</text>
  <text start="555.17" dur="5.1">the corporation&amp;#39;s yes Trump went in</text>
  <text start="557.63" dur="3.96">there he spoke to them now most likely</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="2.61">he&amp;#39;s probably speaking to them saying</text>
  <text start="561.59" dur="3.27">listen we know the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="3.93">well believe me these corporations they</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="4.58">know what the economy is really doing</text>
  <text start="566.81" dur="5.55">the top of the top they know exactly</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="4.42">what&amp;#39;s going on here they know that</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="2.55">their sales aren&amp;#39;t where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="3.12">supposed to be why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="3.96">out they&amp;#39;re closing factory dat</text>
  <text start="576.98" dur="3.17">factories down moving outside of the</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="3.15">United States</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="4.66">why do you think they&amp;#39;re buying back</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="4.74">their stocks why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="3.84">laying off people why do you think</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re trying to cut expenses they know</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="4.71">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on I mean you</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="4.26">really don&amp;#39;t have to be a rocket science</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="4.53">to look and say okay we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="4.83">the sales that we used to gee I wonder</text>
  <text start="597.89" dur="6.84">why I guess these unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="6.63">aren&amp;#39;t real they know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="604.73" dur="5.37">now most likely this is for after the</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="6.99">collapse we r they going to try to</text>
  <text start="610.1" dur="6.98">rebuild America and it&amp;#39;s not for right</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="5.43">now because there&amp;#39;s nothing he can do</text>
  <text start="617.08" dur="7.69">with what&amp;#39;s happening right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.12" dur="8.18">completely impossible because who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.77" dur="9.03">still in control the central bank the</text>
  <text start="628.3" dur="9.07">central bank created all of this with</text>
  <text start="633.8" dur="6.6">the help of certain individuals in</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="6.27">government and like I said before there</text>
  <text start="640.4" dur="8.04">is no reason to have a central bank what</text>
  <text start="643.64" dur="7.91">benefit does it serve it doesn&amp;#39;t now</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="7.35">Trump he decided to call jian-ping</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="7.51">Chinese China&amp;#39;s president and he is</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="5.93">going to honor the one China policy and</text>
  <text start="659.06" dur="6.87">everyone looks at this and saying he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="6.61">backtracking he&amp;#39;s giving in but I think</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="4.98">what he does is he tries to see how far</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="5.52">he can get and I think at this point he</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="5.52">sees that the elite those individuals</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="5.7">behind the curtain hoard unelected</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to push him into some</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="5.46">type of provocation with China and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.42" dur="3.15">looking at the situation saying okay we</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t want to go to war that&amp;#39;s the last</text>
  <text start="686.57" dur="3.9">thing we want so it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.64" dur="4.62">backing off right now because he sees</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="5.07">what they are doing but what we are</text>
  <text start="693.26" dur="4.86">seeing is that foreign governments they</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="6.24">are dumping us treasuries as never</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="7.41">before and it&amp;#39;s not just China and</text>

  <text start="705.53" dur="4.65">Arabia is doing it and many other</text>
  <text start="707.27" dur="4.53">countries they&amp;#39;re continually dumping us</text>
  <text start="710.18" dur="3.09">treasuries and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="3.36">about all this it</text>
  <text start="713.27" dur="4.83">really picked up right in the beginning</text>
  <text start="715.16" dur="4.5">of 2014 it started to drop and then we</text>
  <text start="718.1" dur="3.51">had this dead cat bounce of where</text>
  <text start="719.66" dur="5.73">Treasuries were purchased once again and</text>
  <text start="721.61" dur="8.1">then boom as soon as 2015 hit they were</text>
  <text start="725.39" dur="6.3">dumping them like crazy now something</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="5.49">very interesting where this is a</text>
  <text start="731.69" dur="5.28">recession alert and we talked about many</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="4.37">different indicators that are indicating</text>
  <text start="736.97" dur="6.39">that we are in a recession right now in</text>
  <text start="739.57" dur="5.2">January the US Treasury brought in a</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="4.11">total receipts of about three hundred</text>
  <text start="744.77" dur="3.96">and forty-four billion versus outlays of</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="4.34">only two hundred ninety three billion</text>
  <text start="748.73" dur="5.1">resulting in a surplus of 51 billion</text>
  <text start="751.81" dur="3.22">substantially greater than the 40</text>
  <text start="753.83" dur="2.88">billion that was expected now the</text>
  <text start="755.03" dur="3.24">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="756.71" dur="3.21">making a really big deal about this like</text>
  <text start="758.27" dur="5.94">oh my God look at this we have a surplus</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="8.82">this is fantastic well not as fantastic</text>
  <text start="764.21" dur="9.09">as it seems because what we see right</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="6.93">now the surplus which is largely due to</text>
  <text start="773.3" dur="5.07">a law requiring the IRS to delay sending</text>
  <text start="775.67" dur="6.06">out tax refund checks to household</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="7.26">claiming certain tax credits that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="6.84">we saw this surplus so for the fiscal</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="6.18">year through January 31st the total u.s.</text>
  <text start="788.57" dur="5.34">budget deficit was 157 billion and said</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="4.58">to keep rising this year and for the</text>
  <text start="793.91" dur="4.77">foreseeable future however a more</text>
  <text start="796.39" dur="4.12">concerning data point emerges when</text>
  <text start="798.68" dur="5.61">looking at the annual change in the</text>
  <text start="800.51" dur="6.48">rolling 12-month total this is the point</text>
  <text start="804.29" dur="6.15">where we find the following for the</text>
  <text start="806.99" dur="6">period ended January 31st total</text>
  <text start="810.44" dur="5.34">government receipts were three point two</text>
  <text start="812.99" dur="5.43">seven trillion this number was point</text>
  <text start="815.78" dur="6.74">three percent lower than the three point</text>
  <text start="818.42" dur="8.76">two eight trillion reported a year ago</text>
  <text start="822.52" dur="6.85">why is this important every time since</text>
  <text start="827.18" dur="4.95">at least 1970 when the government</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="7.29">receipts have returned negative on an</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="7.26">annual basis the US was on the cusp of a</text>
  <text start="836.66" dur="6.12">recession the last time government</text>
  <text start="839.39" dur="7.17">receipts deter- was in July of 2008 and</text>
  <text start="842.78" dur="7.93">they just turned negative now</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="7.24">this tells us we are headed towards a</text>
  <text start="850.71" dur="5.67">collapse we&amp;#39;re already in the recession</text>
  <text start="853.8" dur="5.76">and we can see that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="856.38" dur="4.769">the central bank they are now playing up</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="3.96">the narrative we know that Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="861.149" dur="5.011">said listen because of Trump policies</text>
  <text start="863.52" dur="6.48">this might bring down the economy he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="866.16" dur="6.45">he will be to blame for all of this now</text>
  <text start="870" dur="5.459">Fitch&amp;#39;s out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="872.61" dur="4.41">well because of Trump and his</text>
  <text start="875.459" dur="6.69">administration because of his economic</text>
  <text start="877.02" dur="9.509">policies if there is a global economic</text>
  <text start="882.149" dur="7.581">crash well it will be blamed on Trump he</text>
  <text start="886.529" dur="5.581">got rid of the trans-pacific partnership</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="4.09">he has these ridiculous economic</text>
  <text start="892.11" dur="5.099">policies that he&amp;#39;s trying to push for it</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="7.65">forward and fit right now is sounding</text>
  <text start="897.209" dur="6.991">the alarm that yes trump&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="901.47" dur="5.19">policies are going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="4.86">economy they are setting up the</text>
  <text start="906.66" dur="4.11">narrative now we know that there are</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="4.59">many individuals out there like Charles</text>
  <text start="910.77" dur="5.25">mentor cliff high harried then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.65" dur="4.47">all talking about something happening in</text>
  <text start="916.02" dur="3.27">the third quarter of this year and</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re all using different type of</text>
  <text start="919.29" dur="5.82">models to predict this and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="922.74" dur="4.07">seeing the narrative of the story saying</text>
  <text start="925.11" dur="6.06">that if something should just happen</text>
  <text start="926.81" dur="9.46">it&amp;#39;s all Trump&amp;#39;s fault now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="931.17" dur="8.73">to take this one step further here Price</text>
  <text start="936.27" dur="8.189">Waterhouse Coopers put out a new report</text>
  <text start="939.9" dur="7.5">and what they&amp;#39;re talking about is how</text>
  <text start="944.459" dur="6.601">the West is going to become the new</text>
  <text start="947.4" dur="7.26">third world now I had an interview with</text>
  <text start="951.06" dur="5.49">bill halter many months ago where we</text>
  <text start="954.66" dur="6.35">talked about how the United States would</text>
  <text start="956.55" dur="6.87">become a third world country and now</text>
  <text start="961.01" dur="8.019">PricewaterhouseCoopers they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="963.42" dur="6.87">out this report saying yes that if</text>
  <text start="969.029" dur="5.191">everything keeps going the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="970.29" dur="7.669">going the West the United States will</text>
  <text start="974.22" dur="3.739">become a third-world country</text>
  <text start="978.88" dur="5.28">and this is what they said the report</text>
  <text start="981.85" dur="5.04">takes a particular metric and simply</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="6.21">projects into the future the first world</text>
  <text start="986.89" dur="6.27">will no longer be first indeed arguably</text>
  <text start="990.37" dur="5.37">it will be no longer even be second the</text>
  <text start="993.16" dur="4.32">economic forecast and the pwc report</text>
  <text start="995.74" dur="6.53">shows at the so-called first world on a</text>
  <text start="997.48" dur="7.5">steady slide to third world status and</text>
  <text start="1002.27" dur="7">they&amp;#39;re saying that other countries like</text>
  <text start="1004.98" dur="9">Mexico Indonesia are likely likely to be</text>
  <text start="1009.27" dur="6.99">larger than the UK France and other</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="6.39">countries so we can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1016.26" dur="7.62">right now things are rapidly changing</text>
  <text start="1020.37" dur="5.64">now will they change on a dime no and</text>
  <text start="1023.88" dur="4.439">the reason why they&amp;#39;re all saying this</text>
  <text start="1026.01" dur="4.86">is because they&amp;#39;ve been watching the</text>
  <text start="1028.319" dur="5.551">real economy not the stock market they</text>
  <text start="1030.87" dur="4.92">be looking at the retail market they</text>
  <text start="1033.87" dur="3.66">showing that it&amp;#39;s sliding they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1035.79" dur="3.029">looking at the manufacturing here in the</text>
  <text start="1037.53" dur="4.11">United States they&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="1038.819" dur="4.921">the debt level they looking at who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1041.64" dur="4.62">going to be the reserve currency and we</text>
  <text start="1043.74" dur="4.41">know that China and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1046.26" dur="5.4">duplicating everything here in the West</text>
  <text start="1048.15" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re duplicating it to be active</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="6.33">in the East which is telling us that</text>
  <text start="1055.38" dur="5.76">things are going to switch and change</text>
  <text start="1057.99" dur="6.18">everything is going to be moved away and</text>
  <text start="1061.14" dur="5.64">the way of life that we once known is</text>
  <text start="1064.17" dur="4.59">going to change dramatically is it going</text>
  <text start="1066.78" dur="4.59">to happen on a Monday no it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1068.76" dur="4.17">take time but you will see the slide as</text>
  <text start="1071.37" dur="4.14">we go through this as the economy</text>
  <text start="1072.93" dur="5.43">collapses the recovery is not going to</text>
  <text start="1075.51" dur="5.88">be like we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past most</text>
  <text start="1078.36" dur="5.37">likely according to cliff hi we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1081.39" dur="5.88">recover for five years we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="6.72">through some pain to get things back on</text>
  <text start="1087.27" dur="4.8">track and by that time guess what the</text>
  <text start="1090.45" dur="4.56">United States most likely will not be</text>
  <text start="1092.07" dur="6.87">the reserve currency of the world we</text>
  <text start="1095.01" dur="8.52">don&amp;#39;t even have manufacturing here we</text>
