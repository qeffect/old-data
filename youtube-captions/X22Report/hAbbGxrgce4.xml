  <text start="57.11" dur="4.87">2016 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="59.58" dur="5.43">the central bankers need one more thing</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="6.84">to transform the u.s. into a fascist</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="6.81">state let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="6.09">collapse financial news so here we are</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="6.12">one day before the elections and what</text>
  <text start="74.91" dur="6.15">have we noticed well if we go back a</text>
  <text start="77.94" dur="5.64">couple of days we know that they created</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.11">the illusion that GDP has surged to</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="4.77">two-point-nine percent making the</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="4.8">economy look really great two or three</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="3">days before the election they brought</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="4.14">the unemployment number down to four</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.31">point nine percent and what else did</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="6.33">they need to do to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="96.66" dur="5.76">that Wow things are really back on track</text>
  <text start="100.44" dur="4.05">and if you notice they&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="5.309">the last minute to do all of this stuff</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="6.42">because people only remember pretty much</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="5.34">the last thing they see and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.91" dur="5.31">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re having the</text>
  <text start="113.069" dur="6.72">stock market surge by hundreds of points</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="8.91">and they&amp;#39;re suppressing gold at the same</text>
  <text start="119.789" dur="7.44">time convincing everyone that wow we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="5.22">down a four point nine percent the</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="6.751">economy GDP surged and the market is</text>
  <text start="130.35" dur="6.87">incredible gold is falling this is an</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="8.07">incredible recovery and they plan this</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="8.01">to the T right on cue right before the</text>
  <text start="142.05" dur="7.56">elections but when we look at all of</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="8.61">this we know that this is an illusion we</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="9.959">know this was manufactured to create a</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="11.06">story that the government has done its</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="8.221">job to get their candidate into power</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s what all of this is about right</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="6.029">now we know the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="6.76">we&amp;#39;ve been following and tracking the</text>
  <text start="173.819" dur="4.981">economic indicators I mean for instance</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="3.75">the four point nine percent makes no</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="1.92">sense whatsoever because when we look at</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="4.29">the</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="7.89">feds own job indicator it has plunged</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="6.12">year over a year and we can see that</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="3.99">they tried to improve this by making</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.62">revisions for the last seven months in a</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="6">row but guess what the Fed the feds</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="5.82">labor market condition index well it</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t look any better even with the</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="7.29">revisions because we see the October</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="6.42">print it shows that the Fed labor market</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="5.22">condition index is negative</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="8.94">year-over-year for the eighth time in</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="9.54">u.s. history and every time that the Fed</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="6.26">labor market condition index falls into</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="7.77">negative territory what do we have</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="7.15">pretty much a recession and we are</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.92">seeing this happen right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="5.73">seeing that the indicator is showing</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="4.98">that we are heading towards a recession</text>
  <text start="238.89" dur="5.16">the New York Fed&amp;#39;s recession indicator</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="5.64">is spiking to new highs showing us that</text>
  <text start="244.05" dur="5.55">we are heading for a recession the</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="5.039">Dallas Fed is showing us the same thing</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="3.66">I mean once we start putting all these</text>
  <text start="251.519" dur="6.451">them together it&amp;#39;s not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="7.5">that the Dallas Fed the New York Fed the</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="3.93">Fed labor market index all of it is</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.23">showing that we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="5.1">recession we&amp;#39;re in a recession we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.71">headed anywhere we&amp;#39;re headed towards a</text>
  <text start="267" dur="4.89">depression and we can see from many</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="5.52">other indicators that we look at the</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="6.24">situation is not improving it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="5.04">having the opposite effect of everything</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;ve done where they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="4.409">us that look the stock market is rising</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.07">everything is fine but when we look at</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="5.341">let&amp;#39;s say the restaurants the restaurant</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="5.88">industry we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re heading into their own recession</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.11">and this is coming out of market watch</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="5.97">now because they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="6.03">things aren&amp;#39;t making sense and moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="6.96">is out there saying yeah it looks like</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="7.79">consumers are grappling with getting</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.21">enough funds to go out to eat with</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="5.72">rising costs of rent</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="6.87">with car loans the rising cost of health</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="5.5">insurance with individuals making less</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="5.76">and less money people are saying you</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="5.94">know something I&amp;#39;m just going to eat at</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="4.11">home I&amp;#39;m not going to go out and get</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="3.81">food at a restaurant and they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="4.08">predicting like restaurants like olive</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="4.77">garden Cheesecake Factory and many</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="6.44">others guess what they&amp;#39;re expecting a</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="6.33">decline in foot traffic in revenue and</text>
  <text start="340.54" dur="5.26">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all along</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="4.14">and actually what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="4.05">going to be much much worse than what</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re really saying they always make</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="3.12">it seem like yes there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="3.27">little bit of a decline but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="3.03">going to be that bad and what that</text>
  <text start="354.26" dur="4.89">really means is gonna it&amp;#39;s going to fall</text>
  <text start="356" dur="6.18">pretty hard and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="6.63">that already in October the October</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="7.14">retail sales well they&amp;#39;re not impressive</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="8.07">at all and when we look at the Thomson</text>
  <text start="369.32" dur="8.52">Reuters same-store sales the sss this</text>
  <text start="373.85" dur="8.03">index shows that sales from last year</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="8.67">were higher than they are this year and</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re looking at the sales index and</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re saying for this holiday season</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="6.51">it is not going to be good at all it</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="5.01">healthy those are the words that they</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="7.74">are using and we can see right now guess</text>
  <text start="399.32" dur="7.59">what it&amp;#39;s not going to be we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="7.05">trucking once again class 8 truck orders</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="7.11">they are continually plummeting they are</text>

  <text start="427.55" dur="4.65">quarter again what are we looking at</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="4.051">here we&amp;#39;re looking at a decline and</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing it through all the</text>
  <text start="433.97" dur="5.88">different economic indicators and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="4.95">seeing October of 2016 the net orders</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="4.41">were down by forty six percent compared</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="4.68">to last year in fact the level of</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="2.94">trailing 12-month net orders is the</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.05">lowest since Jan</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="7.95">of 2011 2011 and down forty-nine percent</text>
  <text start="450.29" dur="6.96">from their februari peak so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="6">seeing once again is that all these</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="7.02">indicators the Fed indicator the new</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="5.67">york fed the Dallas Fed everything is</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="5.25">pointing towards a recession /</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="4.44">depression and once again i do believe</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re in a recession already we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.86">heading towards a depression and this is</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="3.57">why the shadow government the deep stay</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="5.88">at the central bankers the elite the</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="6.72">globalists they need their candidate to</text>
  <text start="482" dur="5.7">continue what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="484.16" dur="7.08">that is to collapse the economy to go to</text>
  <text start="487.7" dur="5.94">war and remove the rights from the</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="6.41">people there are going to continue with</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="8.7">that agenda and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="6.73">inflation is on its way and right now we</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="4.86">see gold is annihilating stocks as the</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="6.99">other up 23% first two percent on the</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="6.24">sp500 and we can see that inflation is</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="5.37">on its wife because during periods of</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="5.34">high inflation silver outperforms gold</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="4.44">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="5.16">and this is a major signal that</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="6">inflation is headed our way and if you</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="5.73">have not gotten your supplies I would</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="3.45">suggest doing it at this point because</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="2.91">you don&amp;#39;t want to be caught in that</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="5.19">situation just like the people in</text>
  <text start="532.58" dur="5.01">Venezuela the people of Greece and many</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="4.14">others because it&amp;#39;s not just inflation</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="4.41">it shortages and everything else you</text>
  <text start="539.96" dur="3.39">will not be able to get what you need so</text>
  <text start="542" dur="2.46">you need to get the water you need to</text>
  <text start="543.35" dur="3.3">get the food you need to get the</text>
  <text start="544.46" dur="3.54">toiletries you need to have a weapon to</text>
  <text start="546.65" dur="4.29">protect your family you need gold and</text>
  <text start="548" dur="6.75">silver you need cash on hand you need</text>
  <text start="550.94" dur="6.9">all of these things David Stockman he is</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="6.11">warning that doesn&amp;#39;t matter who wins the</text>
  <text start="557.84" dur="5.49">election it looks like there might be a</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="7.09">25-percent sell off from the stock</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="8.61">market after the elections and we can</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="7.14">see right now that this entire economic</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="4.74">system it&amp;#39;s going to unravel after the</text>
  <text start="575.09" dur="5.04">elections they&amp;#39;ve been holding it</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="4.139">together with spit tape and glue just to</text>
  <text start="580.13" dur="3.119">get through the elec</text>
  <text start="580.819" dur="5.97">and to get their candidate into power</text>
  <text start="583.249" dur="9.18">and we can see already they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="586.789" dur="9.24">calls to create a fascist state now yes</text>
  <text start="592.429" dur="5.76">are we in a fascist state yes we are but</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="6.6">they want to complete it how do they do</text>
  <text start="598.189" dur="7.531">that all they have to do is merge the</text>
  <text start="602.629" dur="4.74">federal reserve into the government</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="3.869">remember the federal reserve is separate</text>
  <text start="607.369" dur="5.52">right now it&amp;#39;s a separate corporation</text>
  <text start="609.589" dur="6.66">and we can see already out in</text>

  <text start="634.339" dur="8.28">direction right now so when we step back</text>
  <text start="638.419" dur="7.681">and we look at what they&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="642.619" dur="7.56">created Common Core to cheat to teach</text>
  <text start="646.1" dur="7.5">our young basically that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
