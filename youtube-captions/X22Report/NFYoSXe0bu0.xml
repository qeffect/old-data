  <text start="52.489" dur="5.67">when you re poor my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="54.44" dur="6.66">this is episode 1257 bien today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="58.159" dur="5.071">is April eighteenth 2017 and the totally</text>
  <text start="61.1" dur="5.73">episode is are the deceivers being</text>
  <text start="63.23" dur="5.97">deceived by their own game let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="66.83" dur="4.89">into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="69.2" dur="5.25">energy of political news now the</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="5.73">corporate media is out there and Trump</text>
  <text start="74.45" dur="4.47">is also out there agreeing with the</text>
  <text start="77.45" dur="3.69">corporate media that his poll numbers</text>
  <text start="78.92" dur="4.68">are way up and he&amp;#39;s patting himself on</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="4.8">the back saying see look now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="5.309">interesting about all of this during his</text>
  <text start="85.94" dur="4.53">campaign he never really looked at the</text>
  <text start="88.909" dur="3.331">poll numbers from the corporate media</text>
  <text start="90.47" dur="4.17">because the corporate media basically</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="5.25">they were manipulating the poll numbers</text>
  <text start="94.64" dur="4.92">and he pointed that out now he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="5.04">along with the poll numbers saying yes</text>
  <text start="99.56" dur="5.25">look I am fantastic everything is great</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="4.679">but when you look at the Gallup poll</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="6.36">numbers it shows that Trump has dropped</text>
  <text start="107.209" dur="5.671">17 points since februari on the question</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="3.869">whether Americans believe he keeps his</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="5.07">promises and this is according to a new</text>
  <text start="115.039" dur="5.701">gallup survey and this is shortly after</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="4.199">taking office gallup poll showed a</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="3.989">sixty-two percent of americans believe</text>
  <text start="122.149" dur="5.311">trump kept his promises but the same</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="6.241">survey taken from april 59th showed only</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="5.43">forty-five percent felt the same way so</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="5.72">we have a little bit of a disagreement</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="7.17">on what is going on here and gallop is</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="6.99">most likely the right numbers because</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="6.989">they are the people poll now again is</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="6.58">Trump part of the deep state is he</text>
  <text start="147.049" dur="5.041">playing a game is he deceiving the deep</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="4.949">state the establishment the central bank</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="6">well people are on both sides right now</text>
  <text start="155.209" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m using all the different indicators</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="3.929">that i&amp;#39;m looking at i&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="4.141">he&amp;#39;s not part of the deep state i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="4.111">saying he&amp;#39;s a savior like people are</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="4.65">saying i am looking at everything that</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s doing right now and for those</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="5.34">people who say I never have any hope I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="6.66">giving about 1% of hope to this but do I</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="5.13">believe that he might turn or he is part</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.62">of the deep state or the deep state has</text>
  <text start="179.06" dur="3.81">control over him that could be and we</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="3.57">will find out</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="5.94">soon enough if this is absolutely true</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="6.72">because if it is true we&amp;#39;re going to war</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="6.39">we have our answer we know right there</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="5.73">and then that the deep state has him</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s agreeing with them he&amp;#39;s getting us</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="5.49">into war the economy is collapsing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="5.369">doing everything they want him to do but</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.549">until that point we need to look at each</text>
  <text start="206.299" dur="4.981">and every indicator and look at what</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="4.771">he&amp;#39;s doing right now and I know people</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="5.549">are pointing out jared kushner I know</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="6.3">that they&amp;#39;re pointing out that he&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="7.321">of this whole entire system where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="6.299">now leading him into this well I still</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.559">have to say Trump he&amp;#39;s a businessman</text>
  <text start="226.609" dur="5.281">he&amp;#39;s been in business for a very long</text>
  <text start="228.709" dur="6.15">time he knows how to work the system he</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="5.099">understands when the system is not</text>
  <text start="234.859" dur="4.8">working he understands when you need to</text>
  <text start="236.989" dur="5.34">go bankrupt he understands there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="239.659" dur="5.7">point where you have to default he knows</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="6.03">when people are playing games with him</text>
  <text start="245.359" dur="5.13">and right now when we look at these</text>
  <text start="248.359" dur="4.771">indicators we have to take all of this</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="4.441">into consideration and we also have to</text>
  <text start="253.13" dur="4.199">weed out a lot of the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="3.72">people are pushing now because I notice</text>
  <text start="257.329" dur="5.701">a lot of the propaganda all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="258.65" dur="7.53">came up as soon as the Syrian crisis hit</text>
  <text start="263.03" dur="5.31">and the corporate media was applauding</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="3.15">him and then all of a sudden everyone</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="3.54">started to come out with all this</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="5.309">information but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="271.88" dur="6.03">now is that the poll numbers are</text>
  <text start="274.639" dur="6.15">actually down people are not looking at</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="5.039">him the same way as they were before we</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="4.38">see the white house right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.949" dur="5.22">looking at the petition site and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="6.211">saying we&amp;#39;re thinking about dumping this</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="4.5">now Obama created this petition site</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="3.45">where you went on there you created a</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="4.171">petition and if it reached 100,000</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="4.5">signatures or something like that they</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="4.5">would address it and what happened was</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.14">this was really a propaganda tool</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="6.81">because they never did anything and</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.94">under Obama I mean people were filling</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.71">out petitions they got a hundred</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="6.18">thousand signatures and the petitions</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="3.48">that challenged the administration went</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="3.78">years</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="5.73">without answer while goofy like softball</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="5.609">softball or more political convenient</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="6.75">one&amp;#39;s got a response so this was</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="8.91">basically created as a propaganda tool</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="8.04">to make we the people believe that that</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="5.941">we had a say in what the government was</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="5.64">doing now the only reason to keep the</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="5.1">petition site up as if Trump is actually</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="5.91">going to answer these petitions if</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s a waste of time I would</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="3.99">like to see a petition site where they</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="3.42">actually answer it that&amp;#39;d be very nice</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="4.92">but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="5.7">we see Trump is keeping his promise with</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="4.26">America first right now he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="4.11">sign an executive order that aims to</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="4.649">overhaul the h-1b visa program used by</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="5.49">tech companies to bring in high school</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="6.211">workers to the US and basically he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="6.18">putting this forth to say listen buy</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="7.5">American and hire American and a lot of</text>
  <text start="375.68" dur="7.68">these h-1b visas come from large Indian</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="6.57">consulting firms and they are by far the</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="6.39">largest users of the h-1b visa program</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="6.18">and most of these individuals go to work</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="4.56">for Microsoft Google Facebook and we</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="4.26">could see there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="5.039">backlash on this because this is where</text>
  <text start="396.95" dur="4.92">most of the employees are coming one for</text>
  <text start="399.349" dur="5.07">these gigantic tech companies now we see</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="5.43">Theresa May she made a stunning</text>
  <text start="404.419" dur="5.43">announcement today where she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="407.3" dur="4.86">that she wants a snap election and</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="4.801">there&amp;#39;s going to be a load of unhappy</text>
  <text start="412.16" dur="4.89">labour politicians this afternoon even</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.62">though many of them hold safe seats we</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.799">suspect that many will be updating their</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="5.76">CVS and looking for new jobs May&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="6.721">intent is to clear the decks of dissent</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="6.09">but there are risks may does risk losing</text>
  <text start="428.57" dur="4.319">her overall majority it&amp;#39;s only 16</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="3.6">especially if voters respond favorably</text>
  <text start="432.889" dur="4.831">to the Liberals who will try to turn it</text>
  <text start="434.72" dur="5.16">into a vote on brexit but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="4.35">see what happens with all of this but</text>
  <text start="439.88" dur="4.5">she did take everyone by surprise by</text>
  <text start="442.07" dur="4.969">doing this now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="5.92">understand that McCain and Graham</text>
  <text start="447.039" dur="5.391">visited Ukraine it was on</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="4.98">yo where they said this is going to be</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="5.01">the year of the offensive now since that</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="3.96">period of time things have been</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="4.53">happening in Ukraine yes there was a</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="4.859">truce deal that was signed but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="5.009">seen this before where they sign the</text>
  <text start="464.099" dur="9">truce and they needed this period of</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="9.331">time for a piece so McCain Graham the</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="6.57">deep state they are able to ramp up</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="6.329">their military assets and plan out their</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="5.97">attack in Ukraine and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="7.68">right now is that there might be an</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="7.471">offensive coming around May 9th a day</text>
  <text start="490.319" dur="5.15">which is symbolic significance as it is</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="4.619">not only the start of Eurovision contest</text>
  <text start="495.469" dur="5.23">hosted in Kiev this year but also</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="6.631">Victory Day in Russia and the former</text>
  <text start="500.699" dur="5.97">USSR and it looks like that things are</text>
  <text start="504.36" dur="4.95">starting to ramp up right now because</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="5.581">what they&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge ramp up of</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="5.849">military assets and we know that McCain</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="5.25">and Graham were out there and they were</text>
  <text start="515.159" dur="5.581">telling them yes this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="6.149">year of the offensive now we know the</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="6.15">deep state is trying to get the world</text>
  <text start="523.649" dur="5.13">into war they&amp;#39;re out in Syria doing this</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re out in North Korea doing this</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="4.021">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="530.31" dur="5.43">to push the agenda in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re hoping that Trump goes along</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="4.98">with this and starts the war now if he</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="5.07">is part of the deep state and he is part</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="4.32">of the establishment now he&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="543.18" dur="5.61">going to go for that he&amp;#39;s going to start</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="6.6">war if he&amp;#39;s not and he&amp;#39;s playing them</text>
  <text start="548.79" dur="6.09">well we will see the indicators to show</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="5.759">us that he is not part of it and this is</text>
  <text start="554.88" dur="4.89">what we&amp;#39;re looking at now yesterday the</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="5.3">corporate media was out there and they</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="5.34">are pushing propaganda like crazy and</text>
  <text start="562.699" dur="5.231">there was a report that came out that</text>
  <text start="565.11" dur="4.8">said US aircraft carrier Strike groups</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="4.589">are heading towards North Korea now</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re saying that the USS Carl Vinson</text>
  <text start="572.519" dur="4.851">that is steaming towards North Korea</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="5.88">then they dispatched the Ronald Reagan</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="5.97">the Nimitz and those Strike groups they</text>
  <text start="580.589" dur="5.451">are heading towards North Korea</text>
  <text start="583.34" dur="5.76">and what we need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="586.04" dur="7.14">the corporate media they are pushing</text>
  <text start="589.1" dur="5.85">propaganda really hard now I decided</text>
  <text start="593.18" dur="3.42">let&amp;#39;s take a look at where these ships</text>
  <text start="594.95" dur="5.4">actually are and what they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="6.6">doing and we see right now the USS Carl</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="5.31">Vincent well this strike group is</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="4.35">currently involved in scheduled</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="4.53">exercises with Australian forces in the</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="5.67">Indian Ocean far from North Korea</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="6.75">according to defense news and we can see</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="6.45">that yes this this strike group sales</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="5.49">back and forth in this area when they</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="4.77">talked about the Ronald Reagan and an</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="4.43">image strike group joining the Vinson</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="4.83">well these are a little overblown</text>
  <text start="626.86" dur="4.39">because right now the Ronald Reagan</text>
  <text start="629.27" dur="5.76">aircraft carrier is undergoing</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="6">maintenance in Yokosuka Japan and the</text>
  <text start="635.03" dur="4.89">scheduled for completion of all this</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="4.59">maintenance is scheduled for May so here</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="4.17">we are in April this ship is going</text>
  <text start="641.84" dur="4.59">nowhere right now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="644.09" dur="4.29">Nimitz this carrier strike group is</text>
  <text start="646.43" dur="4.01">currently off Southern California&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="653.36" dur="6.03">Vincent Strike Group in the Pacific</text>
  <text start="655.34" dur="6.54">waters later this spring so even mad as</text>
  <text start="659.39" dur="5.67">defense secretary mattis is out there</text>
  <text start="661.88" dur="5.64">saying that the Vinson operates freely</text>
  <text start="665.06" dur="5.43">up and down the Pacific and it&amp;#39;s just on</text>
  <text start="667.52" dur="4.92">its way up there because that&amp;#39;s where we</text>
  <text start="670.49" dur="4.32">thought it was most prudent to have it</text>
  <text start="672.44" dur="4.08">and we could see right now the</text>
  <text start="674.81" dur="4.29">propaganda that&amp;#39;s coming out in the way</text>
  <text start="676.52" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="4.41">illusion that all these aircraft</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="3.69">carriers are heading towards North</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="3.9">Korea&amp;#39;s steaming there as fast as they</text>

  <text start="687.41" dur="6.09">in North Korea just isn&amp;#39;t true and then</text>
  <text start="690.77" dur="4.35">we look at more propaganda coming out of</text>
  <text start="693.5" dur="4.23">the corporate media the deep state</text>
  <text start="695.12" dur="3.96">remember they need this property I mean</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="3.27">why should we believe them at this point</text>
  <text start="699.08" dur="5.13">we shouldn&amp;#39;t because we know that they</text>
  <text start="701" dur="7.02">lie we know that they use propaganda to</text>
  <text start="704.21" dur="7.89">get things done the way they want and</text>
  <text start="708.02" dur="5.97">what they want is war now they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="712.1" dur="3.87">there saying that the Pentagon and this</text>

  <text start="715.97" dur="2.59">going to</text>
  <text start="716.55" dur="5.43">shoot down a North Korean missile</text>
  <text start="718.56" dur="5.07">because Trump is so unpredictable most</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="4.44">likely he will do this even though other</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="4.59">presidents have not well wouldn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="726.42" dur="4.289">be absolutely ridiculous first of all</text>

  <text start="732.66" dur="5.16">attacking but most likely they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="5.34">developed a missile that actually can</text>
  <text start="737.82" dur="4.65">that that can actually work so why in</text>
  <text start="741.06" dur="3.93">the world would the United States</text>
  <text start="742.47" dur="5.19">government central bankers go ahead and</text>

  <text start="750.48" dur="4.89">sense no the only thing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="753.329" dur="3.301">trying to do is make you believe that</text>
  <text start="755.37" dur="3.719">this is going to happen now they might</text>

  <text start="762.209" dur="4.111">know the ocean and it came down just</text>
  <text start="764.25" dur="5.07">like Bloomberg put out that article that</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="5.009">North Korea fired missiles into China</text>
  <text start="769.32" dur="3.48">and then they retracted the story a</text>

  <text start="780.3" dur="4.349">well if North Korea crosses this red</text>

  <text start="787.77" dur="5.7">tactic Trump he really doesn&amp;#39;t use red</text>

  <text start="793.47" dur="4.02">well North Korea if they cross this red</text>
  <text start="795.57" dur="4.86">line and they shoot another missile that</text>
  <text start="797.49" dur="5.52">is an act of war well Sean Spicer said</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="5.399">the White House was unlikely to draw a</text>

  <text start="919.689" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re coming out with incredible</text>
  <text start="922.389" dur="5.19">stories and most of them i would say</text>
  <text start="925.659" dur="5.94">ninety-nine point nine percent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="927.579" dur="6.9">completely untrue and secondly why would</text>
  <text start="931.599" dur="5.34">the u.s. telegraph that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="934.479" dur="4.11">shoot down North Korean missile why</text>
  <text start="936.939" dur="4.92">would they even do that it makes no</text>
  <text start="938.589" dur="7.5">sense now maddis is out there he</text>
  <text start="941.859" dur="6.42">confirmed he conflicting with Russia now</text>
  <text start="946.089" dur="4.2">remember he says the back when the</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="4.56">Syrian operation was happening they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.289" dur="5.19">saying that well the u.s. is no longer</text>
  <text start="952.839" dur="5.31">talking to Russia whatsoever the hotline</text>
  <text start="955.479" dur="4.86">closed down then we find out that the</text>
  <text start="958.149" dur="4.44">hotline wasn&amp;#39;t closed down that the hot</text>
  <text start="960.339" dur="4.41">line is open the US and Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="962.589" dur="5.1">still talking to each other its</text>
  <text start="964.749" dur="5.49">operational and defense secretary James</text>
  <text start="967.689" dur="4.74">mattis said that well we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="970.239" dur="4.71">work with Russia right now in defeating</text>
  <text start="972.429" dur="4.8">the Islamic state in Syria and ending</text>
  <text start="974.949" dur="4.74">the war in Yemen well that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="977.229" dur="4.8">different he said we continue to D</text>
  <text start="979.689" dur="4.111">conflict with Russians for safety of</text>
  <text start="982.029" dur="3.391">flight to avoid any kind of</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="3.63">misunderstanding or any kind of</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="4.32">inadvertent running into each other as</text>
  <text start="987.43" dur="5.04">the two militaries carry out strikes</text>
  <text start="989.74" dur="4.409">against targets in close proximity we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="992.47" dur="5.67">keeping the lines of communication open</text>
  <text start="994.149" dur="7.44">so that doesn&amp;#39;t fit into the scenario of</text>
  <text start="998.14" dur="8.4">us going and attacking Russia us going</text>
  <text start="1001.589" dur="7.861">and attacking Syria or going into Yemen</text>
  <text start="1006.54" dur="4.919">so the question is is Trump keeping his</text>
  <text start="1009.45" dur="3.569">promise and actually going after the</text>
  <text start="1011.459" dur="4.231">Islamic state like he said he was going</text>
  <text start="1013.019" dur="5.911">to do and the corporate media is trying</text>
  <text start="1015.69" dur="6.66">to spin this news the way they always do</text>
  <text start="1018.93" dur="5.22">because before when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="3.42">they spun it that we were going after</text>
  <text start="1024.15" dur="3.99">the Islamic state and the alternative</text>
  <text start="1025.77" dur="3.99">media was saying that no they weren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="1028.14" dur="4.23">the Islamic state they were hitting the</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="4.65">infrastructure in Syria now the</text>
  <text start="1032.37" dur="4.8">corporate media is that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1034.41" dur="4.769">that Trump what we&amp;#39;re going after Assad</text>
  <text start="1037.17" dur="4.889">we&amp;#39;re going after Assad and the</text>

  <text start="1042.059" dur="6">after the Islamic state hmm very</text>
  <text start="1044.28" dur="7.08">interesting now in Turkey it turns out</text>
  <text start="1048.059" dur="6.151">from international observers they found</text>
  <text start="1051.36" dur="7.8">about 2.5 million Turkish votes and they</text>
  <text start="1054.21" dur="7.65">were possibly manipulated really in the</text>
  <text start="1059.16" dur="5.19">dictatorship of ERDA one there was</text>
  <text start="1061.86" dur="6.21">manipulation in the voting of course</text>
  <text start="1064.35" dur="5.91">there was now MSM was out there and they</text>
  <text start="1068.07" dur="5.07">were saying that because of the Turkish</text>
  <text start="1070.26" dur="5.94">referendum this is going to be used by</text>
  <text start="1073.14" dur="5.07">Putin he will use it to his benefit I</text>
  <text start="1076.2" dur="4.68">mean they&amp;#39;re just putting propaganda and</text>
  <text start="1078.21" dur="5.25">more propaganda out there they also said</text>
  <text start="1080.88" dur="6.15">that Trump called her one to</text>
  <text start="1083.46" dur="5.91">congratulate him on this referendum well</text>
  <text start="1087.03" dur="4.92">first of all the coal was already</text>
  <text start="1089.37" dur="5.52">scheduled in advance and the discussion</text>
  <text start="1091.95" dur="5.969">folks focused on Syria it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1094.89" dur="6.09">about the referendum if you look at the</text>
  <text start="1097.919" dur="5.821">notes from the White House and the media</text>
  <text start="1100.98" dur="4.68">is up in arms over Trump&amp;#39;s recent phone</text>

  <text start="1105.66" dur="5.399">Berta one well this is a completely</text>
  <text start="1108.66" dur="4.53">different discussion but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1111.059" dur="3.991">to make it look like he called them</text>
  <text start="1113.19" dur="4.47">because of the referendum but it was</text>
  <text start="1115.05" dur="5.52">already a scheduled phone call way</text>
  <text start="1117.66" dur="4.95">before this just like the ships that are</text>
  <text start="1120.57" dur="5.37">sailing towards North Korea which they</text>
  <text start="1122.61" dur="6.57">really aren&amp;#39;t we see coming from the</text>
  <text start="1125.94" dur="8.01">moderate rebels they are saying that the</text>
  <text start="1129.18" dur="7.32">CIA told us not to attend the Russian</text>
  <text start="1133.95" dur="6.12">sponsored peace talks because we are</text>
  <text start="1136.5" dur="6.6">paying you not to attend so we can see</text>
  <text start="1140.07" dur="5.43">already that the CIA still involved in</text>
  <text start="1143.1" dur="5.76">all of this they didn&amp;#39;t want the peace</text>
  <text start="1145.5" dur="7.53">talks because their goal is always the</text>

  <text start="1165.09" dur="6.12">in Geneva to have peace talks now this</text>
  <text start="1168.99" dur="5.01">is kind of strange because one moment</text>

  <text start="1192.12" dur="4.71">April 24th the development comes days</text>
  <text start="1194.82" dur="5.04">after Trump revealed his hopes of a</text>
