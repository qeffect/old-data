  <text start="75.01" dur="5.219">closed down and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="77.229" dur="5.28">chaos in the market and when we talked</text>
  <text start="80.229" dur="4.17">about chaos and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="82.509" dur="4.201">volatility of the market and how things</text>
  <text start="84.399" dur="3.511">are reversing now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="86.71" dur="3.6">markets going to come down tomorrow</text>
  <text start="87.91" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re going to see fluctuations in the</text>
  <text start="90.31" dur="3.72">market moving forward yes are we gonna</text>
  <text start="92.05" dur="4.92">have days up we&amp;#39;re gonna also have days</text>
  <text start="94.03" dur="5.01">that are down which shows us that things</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="4.08">are rapidly deteriorating very quickly</text>
  <text start="99.04" dur="4.29">because in the past we just saw the</text>
  <text start="101.05" dur="4.86">market rise market rise market rise and</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="5.899">that was it what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="105.91" dur="5.4">that these huge investors these</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.961">individuals these institutional</text>
  <text start="111.31" dur="4.61">investors the insiders they are dumping</text>
  <text start="114.19" dur="4.32">their stock right now they want retail</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="4.15">investors to pick up the slack here</text>
  <text start="118.51" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re getting out of the markets and</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="3.869">we can see right now the only way to</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="4.05">pump up the markets is with free money</text>
  <text start="123.939" dur="3.811">from the Fed using the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="125.83" dur="4.14">traders to keep the trading going and</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="5.25">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a complete</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="5.94">breakdown and as we move forward we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133" dur="7.17">going to see this chaos continue and</text>
  <text start="135.91" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;re already seeing the entire system</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="3.539">and when we look at the entire system</text>
  <text start="142.09" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re looking at many different economic</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="3.78">indicators we&amp;#39;re looking at housing</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re looking at GDP we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="4.231">retail we&amp;#39;re looking at unemployment</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re looking at corporate defaults</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re looking at the auto loan industry</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re looking at manufacturing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="3.78">looking at many different areas and one</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="2.069">thing that&amp;#39;s been in focus for quite a</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="2.61">while</text>
  <text start="160.269" dur="3.841">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking how retail has been</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="3.6">contracting and I remember first</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="4.14">reporting about this and people were</text>
  <text start="165.88" dur="4.5">laughing and saying that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="4.56">retail is not contracting people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="3.93">losing jobs and as we move forward it</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="3.42">just got worse and worse the same thing</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="4.019">with housing where in the beginning</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="3.479">people like oh it&amp;#39;s perfectly fine in my</text>
  <text start="178.329" dur="2.49">area and yes they&amp;#39;re still going to be</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="4.051">areas where</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="5.611">still fine but what happens is each area</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="5.459">gets hit at different time periods and</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="4.41">people have been emailing me like crazy</text>
  <text start="189.219" dur="4.261">from all over the country saying that</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="5.67">things are dramatically changing in the</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="4.92">real estate market but in retail we can</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="3.72">see right now that this is a complete</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="3.63">disaster I mean Sears right now which we</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.11">know they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="4.319">continue any longer and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="4.079">that many stores are starting to close</text>
  <text start="206.349" dur="5.25">down but what&amp;#39;s more interesting is that</text>
  <text start="208.419" dur="5.88">the corporate media they are starting to</text>
  <text start="211.599" dur="6.271">realize and they&amp;#39;re starting to report</text>
  <text start="214.299" dur="4.8">on how the retail industry is not doing</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="3">well yes they did it in the past but</text>
  <text start="219.099" dur="4.021">they used to say well everything is</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="3.869">moving to online that&amp;#39;s what explains it</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="3.78">oh the weather is bad remember all these</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.321">things it was snowing it was rainy it</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="4.739">was foggy it was sunny and they used all</text>
  <text start="229.06" dur="3.959">these excuses going forward why we said</text>
  <text start="231.639" dur="3.901">no it&amp;#39;s because people are losing jobs</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="3.9">continually they don&amp;#39;t have the extra</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.05">funds to go out and purchase the goods</text>
  <text start="236.919" dur="5.611">and we looked at online and online</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t take up the slack so all what</text>
  <text start="242.53" dur="3.84">they were saying was completely fake</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="4.319">phony and false now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="5.16">is out there saying that the retail</text>
  <text start="248.409" dur="7.17">apocalypse has officially descended on</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="6.509">America really well remember what I said</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.041">many many reports ago the corporate</text>
  <text start="258.039" dur="4.44">media is going to let us know when the</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="3.419">economy coming from the deep state</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="3.361">coming from the central bank when the</text>
  <text start="264.039" dur="4.321">economy is going to start breaking down</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re gonna show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="4.589">not doing as well as they were all</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="3.87">saying and they&amp;#39;ve already started this</text>
  <text start="272.949" dur="4.801">now they&amp;#39;ve come out with this</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="5.13">information that all of a sudden things</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="3.84">aren&amp;#39;t going as well and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="3.299">that thousands of mall based stores</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="3.87">while they&amp;#39;re shutting down in what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.509" dur="4.801">fast becoming one of the biggest waves</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="6.09">of retail closures in decades they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="5.909">saying more than 3,500 stores are</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="5.549">expected to close in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="294.219" dur="5.841">months stores like JCPenney Macy&amp;#39;s Sears</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="5.281">Kmart and many others we also have</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="6.25">middle of the mall chains like Crocs</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="5.43">BCBG Abercrombie Fitch and guess these</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="3.24">were these stores are going to be</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="3.51">closing down and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="4.43">that the number of retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="6.8">in early 2017 are as follows</text>
  <text start="313.98" dur="7.08">Kahless a thousand stores RadioShack 550</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="7.05">to the limited 250 stores family</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="5.94">christian 240 stores what sealed 171 BB</text>
  <text start="325.17" dur="5.34">a hundred and seventy crocks 160</text>
  <text start="327" dur="6.21">JCPenney 138 BCBG 120 American Apparel</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="4.95">110 and it goes on and on and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="4.59">seeing right now is that stores are</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="3.84">closing now think about it if all these</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="3.36">stores are closing we&amp;#39;re all these</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="4.71">people going to get work where do they</text>
  <text start="341.16" dur="4.11">go now it doesn&amp;#39;t really affect the</text>
  <text start="344.01" dur="2.67">unemployment numbers especially those</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="3.27">people who work in part time and it</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="3.24">varies from state to state because it</text>
  <text start="348.54" dur="3.96">all depends on how many hours they work</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="5.01">and how many what their dollar amount is</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="4.65">that they&amp;#39;re earning and remember how</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="3.72">the whole thing works as they lose their</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="3.24">jobs they&amp;#39;re considered part-time if</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="3.51">that getting those hours and not getting</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="3.8">the dollar amount they&amp;#39;re not counted</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re not eligible for unemployment</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="6.19">insurance but when they got the job they</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="4.56">were counted as a full-time job so you</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="3.36">can see how this whole thing works you</text>
  <text start="372.51" dur="3.18">can see how the numbers are skewed</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="2.85">manipulated and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="2.31">seeing right now we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="2.55">thousands and thousands of people</text>
  <text start="378" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re gonna be laid off</text>
  <text start="379.14" dur="5.04">now remember when all these stores</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="6.42">closed how do they count the sales the</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="4.89">retail sales do they just say okay these</text>
  <text start="387" dur="4.26">stores closed in the beginning of 2017</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="3.57">we have 500 stores from this place the</text>
  <text start="391.26" dur="2.25">sales just come to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="392.64" dur="4.56">that go down to zero</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="7.44">no they extrapolated out over the year</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="6.63">and they slowly remove the sales from</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="5.94">each store so it doesn&amp;#39;t hit you hard in</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="5.55">the economy now it hits hard in the real</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="5.52">economy in their fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="6.75">numbers it makes everyone feel good but</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s not real its fake so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="416.13" dur="3.63">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="4.32">doing what we thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="4.14">do they&amp;#39;re starting to prove that the</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="4.2">economy is falling apart now we knew</text>
  <text start="423.9" dur="4.92">this for a very long time we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="426.33" dur="3.66">it all over the place and this is going</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="3.84">to get where it&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="5.58">better it&amp;#39;s going to get worse things</text>
  <text start="432.66" dur="5.55">are deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="435.57" dur="4.77">right now and and what and what they</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="5.48">just reported on this is the number of</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="5.91">stores that are closing in early 2017</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re not even talking about the next</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="3.51">half of 27</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="4.6">because you know there&amp;#39;s gonna be more</text>
  <text start="449.76" dur="4.86">store closures we saw the we see the</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="4.05">auto industry well this is a complete</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="2.91">mess right now the National Association</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="4.5">of auto dealers</text>
  <text start="457.53" dur="6.12">well they reported an anomaly dropping</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="5.1">used vehicle prices in February which</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.37">occurred only for the second time in the</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="5.07">past twenty years it was a big one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.02" dur="5.28">used car guides seasonally adjusted used</text>
  <text start="471" dur="7.02">vehicle price index plunged three point</text>
  <text start="474.3" dur="6.03">eight percent from January by far the</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="5.46">worst recorded for any month since</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="5.43">November of 2008 and that was because of</text>
  <text start="483.48" dur="4.98">a recession which tumbled by five point</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="4.68">six percent which were pretty darn close</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in this</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="5.43">incredible recovery which were not now</text>
  <text start="493.35" dur="4.41">the index has now dropped eight months</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="4.59">in a row and hit the lowest level since</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="5.31">September of 2010 the index the index is</text>
  <text start="500.46" dur="4.59">down eight percent year-over-year and</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="5.82">down thirteen percent from its peak in</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="6.66">2014 and the price the price decline</text>
  <text start="508.89" dur="6.57">spanned all segments and we look at the</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.07">luxury car market we see that it has</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="3.63">come down negative three point one</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="4.8">percent subcompact car negative two</text>
  <text start="519.09" dur="4.56">point one percent large SUV negative one</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="5.58">point nine percent and so on and so on</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="5.97">and we are seeing a surge in new vehicle</text>
  <text start="527.16" dur="4.8">incentive spending now the question is</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="4.83">why are we seeing this well because</text>
  <text start="531.96" dur="5.34">automakers right now they&amp;#39;re drowning in</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="6.27">unsold inventories on dealer lots and</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="6.33">they are desperate to move these</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="4.26">vehicles off the lot so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="3.6">continually getting more and more</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="5.97">incentives and we&amp;#39;ve seen this back in</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="6.48">2008 now in the housing industry well</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="4.86">things are not going well things are</text>
  <text start="553.71" dur="4.53">actually getting worse right now and as</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.5">we know the Fed has raised interest</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="5.79">rates by twenty another 25 basis points</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="6.33">and we can see the end of 2015 as soon</text>
  <text start="564.03" dur="5.04">as a Trump was elected they raise rates</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="4.89">now they raise rates once again and we</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="4.41">can see that rates for mortgages they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="4.26">continually moving up applications are</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="5.609">going down and we see existing home</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="5.61">sales slid in February 3.7 percent of</text>
  <text start="579.089" dur="5.331">course they expected only a two point</text>
  <text start="581.4" dur="5.61">0% fall but it was a lot more than that</text>
  <text start="584.42" dur="5.64">existing condominium and co-op sales</text>
  <text start="587.01" dur="5.67">well they descended by 9.2 percent and</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="4.38">finally judging by the collapse in</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="5.1">mortgage apps and rising mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="6.67">unless there&amp;#39;s all-cash buyers we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="6.56">going to see the housing market decline</text>
  <text start="601.11" dur="6.06">further and we&amp;#39;re already seeing prices</text>
  <text start="604.34" dur="5.59">they are coming down we&amp;#39;re seeing houses</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="5.85">on the market longer and longer just go</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="5.37">on to Zillow take a look around you will</text>

  <text start="624.81" dur="4.62">looking at right now and the corporate</text>
  <text start="627.21" dur="5.76">media is starting to tell us that the</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="6.09">economy is starting to fall apart I mean</text>
  <text start="632.97" dur="5.01">they use the word retail apocalypse I</text>

  <text start="644.67" dur="3.66">trying to get the word out there that</text>
  <text start="646.38" dur="4.47">since Trump is an office they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="648.33" dur="5.01">started it the economy is going to start</text>
  <text start="650.85" dur="4.56">to fail and as we go throughout this</text>
  <text start="653.34" dur="4.62">year throughout the summer we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="5.76">see the Fed out there they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="657.96" dur="5.61">talking about how the economy is still</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="3.78">strong but starting to weaken even</text>
  <text start="663.57" dur="3.33">further so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to raise</text>
  <text start="664.95" dur="4.14">interest rates think about it Janet</text>
  <text start="666.9" dur="3.99">Yellen was out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="3.9">she&amp;#39;s very disappointed in the economy</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="4.17">the economy wasn&amp;#39;t as strong as she</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="4.26">thought it was going to be and she</text>
  <text start="675.06" dur="4.2">decided to raise interest rates during</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="4.26">Obama&amp;#39;s term she told us that the</text>
  <text start="679.26" dur="3.96">economy was doing very well it was very</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="5.22">strong actually the unemployment was</text>
  <text start="683.22" dur="4.86">even lower at that point in time and she</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t want to raise interest rates and</text>
  <text start="688.08" dur="4.59">if you really look at it right after</text>
  <text start="690.66" dur="4.29">Trump became elected she raised the</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="3.87">interest rates in December and then she</text>
  <text start="694.95" dur="3.57">also raised it right after he was</text>
  <text start="696.54" dur="4.5">inaugurated so he was already the</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="5.31">president after he was elected not</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="5.31">officially but they would the transition</text>
  <text start="703.83" dur="5.04">was happening so just in this little</text>
  <text start="706.35" dur="4.64">time span of where he has been the</text>
  <text start="708.87" dur="6.21">president the interest rate has been</text>
  <text start="710.99" dur="6.64">increased twice already compared to a</text>
  <text start="715.08" dur="5.13">Obama so think about what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="717.63" dur="4.14">right now and we know that the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="720.21" dur="4.32">Fed is continually coming out telling us</text>
  <text start="721.77" dur="5.34">that GDP is like 0.9%</text>
  <text start="724.53" dur="4.56">and we can see retail is contracting and</text>
  <text start="727.11" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re thinking about raising the</text>
  <text start="729.09" dur="4.8">interest rates once again and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="731.55" dur="4.17">gonna see mortgage applications we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="733.89" dur="4.47">gonna see housing prices drop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="3.84">gonna see traffic dry up investors are</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="4.35">gonna be getting out of the market</text>
  <text start="739.56" dur="5.43">things are going to rapidly change right</text>
  <text start="742.71" dur="3.96">in front of our eyes and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="744.99" dur="4.2">start pointing fingers they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s because of the economic policies</text>
  <text start="749.19" dur="4.32">that Trump is putting forth they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.9" dur="5.22">gonna say this is really having a toy</text>
  <text start="753.51" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s really taking a toll on the economy</text>
  <text start="756.12" dur="3.81">and they&amp;#39;re gonna continually do this</text>
  <text start="758.4" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m gonna play it up just like they</text>
  <text start="759.93" dur="3">played up the Russian hacking which was</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="3.93">not true</text>
  <text start="762.93" dur="5.58">just like they played up the hacking of</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="4.68">the DNC which was not true just like</text>
  <text start="768.51" dur="5.61">they played up that Trump was not wire</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="5.97">tapped which was not true and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="5.13">gonna continually do this until the very</text>
  <text start="776.82" dur="6.3">end where they&amp;#39;re gonna blame what is</text>
  <text start="779.25" dur="5.34">happening on him because the Fed</text>
  <text start="783.12" dur="6.42">definitely does not want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="784.59" dur="6.9">the Fed needs to redirect all eyes to</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="4.35">someplace else because they know and</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="4.11">they knew this for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="793.89" dur="3.96">knew all of this could not be sustained</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="4.53">and Trump knows that this cannot be</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="4.17">sustained they know that the economy is</text>
  <text start="800.13" dur="4.41">dead in the water that&amp;#39;s why he came out</text>
  <text start="802.02" dur="4.86">and said the economy is a mess he knows</text>
  <text start="804.54" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s going on if he just comes out to</text>
  <text start="806.88" dur="4.05">the people and say hey listen the</text>
  <text start="808.41" dur="3.72">economy is a complete disaster first of</text>
  <text start="810.93" dur="3.42">all the corporate media will jump all</text>
  <text start="812.13" dur="4.38">over him and many of people won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="814.35" dur="5.04">believe it and the Fed will come out and</text>
  <text start="816.51" dur="6.42">deny all of it so he has to do it in a</text>
  <text start="819.39" dur="5.97">certain way now it is a race to see who</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="7.26">brings this system down and how this</text>
  <text start="825.36" dur="7.8">goes because if Trump does bring it down</text>
  <text start="830.19" dur="4.92">and he has the ability to blame it on</text>
  <text start="833.16" dur="4.14">the Fed if he takes this course of</text>
  <text start="835.11" dur="4.47">action it would be the first step in</text>
  <text start="837.3" dur="5.66">getting rid of the Fed or taking control</text>
  <text start="839.58" dur="6.9">of the Fed if the Fed brings down the</text>
  <text start="842.96" dur="4.12">economy before Trump and blames it on</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="2.019">Trump</text>
  <text start="847.08" dur="4.419">well the</text>
  <text start="848.499" dur="6.57">then we&amp;#39;ll try to reset the entire</text>
  <text start="851.499" dur="6.09">system into what they want so right now</text>
  <text start="855.069" dur="5.55">what I&amp;#39;m looking at is there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="857.589" dur="5.61">race right now in who&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="860.619" dur="5.85">down the system we end up in the same</text>
  <text start="863.199" dur="5.16">place where the people lose out where</text>
  <text start="866.469" dur="4.2">the people go through a very tough time</text>
  <text start="868.359" dur="5.16">where the people have to just try to</text>
  <text start="870.669" dur="5.37">survive on their own but it all depends</text>
  <text start="873.519" dur="4.98">on who&amp;#39;s going to bring us out of this</text>
  <text start="876.039" dur="5.67">what system we&amp;#39;re going to be under and</text>
  <text start="878.499" dur="5.94">how we all are going to survive moving</text>
  <text start="881.709" dur="5.22">forward and this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="884.439" dur="5.25">prepared for that transition period no</text>

  <text start="889.689" dur="3.3">going to be a rough couple of months</text>
