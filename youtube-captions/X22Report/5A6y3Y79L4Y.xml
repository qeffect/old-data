  <text start="107.36" dur="5.88">the Special Counsel Robert Mueller he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.929" dur="6.541">still investigating Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="113.24" dur="6.57">and the report came out where he spent a</text>
  <text start="117.47" dur="4.98">huge amount of money for this</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="5.069">investigation about 4.5 million on the</text>
  <text start="122.45" dur="5.82">Russian investigation from October 2017</text>
  <text start="124.879" dur="6.601">to March 2018 bringing the total to</text>
  <text start="128.27" dur="5.549">about 7.7 million now include that with</text>
  <text start="131.48" dur="6.45">the Department of Justice that turns out</text>
  <text start="133.819" dur="7.95">to be about 17 million dollars or so and</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="7.82">we need to understand that this was all</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="7.621">started on a lie and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="6.129">Brennan clapper Comey and the rest</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="5.91">mccabe and the rest this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="151.879" dur="7.25">planned and we know that all of this is</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="7.14">not true we know it&amp;#39;s a hoax the</text>
  <text start="159.129" dur="6.011">Intelligence Committee of the Senate has</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="4.89">said that there is no Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="3.629">Mueller has been investigating and</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="3.96">really can&amp;#39;t find anything actually the</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="4.201">cases that he brought up with Manta fort</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="4.74">and the rest have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="5.67">Russian collusion and what we&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="6.26">out is that the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="6.87">rest they push this and they spent</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="4.9">taxpayer money on something that they</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="4.95">knew was a complete</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="6.93">utter lie and they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="190.46" dur="5.79">spent 17 million dollars of the</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="5.43">taxpayers money and they don&amp;#39;t even care</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="4.44">that they spent this money it makes no</text>
  <text start="199.55" dur="2.76">difference to them and you can see</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s where their heads are at we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="5.52">spend 17 million to push a fake</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="4.95">narrative and that&amp;#39;s basically what</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;ve done because they know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="7.95">real because all this time he&amp;#39;s found</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="6.33">absolutely nothing and that tells you</text>
  <text start="218.24" dur="4.02">something because if they had the</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="4.44">information with all the spying with</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.59">everything that was going on guess what</text>
  <text start="224.84" dur="4.71">it would have been brought out already</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="3.81">but he&amp;#39;s floundering right now he has</text>
  <text start="229.55" dur="2.94">absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re just continually spending our</text>
  <text start="232.49" dur="4.47">money well pretty soon this is all gonna</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="3.54">be wiped out so it&amp;#39;s not gonna make a</text>
  <text start="236.96" dur="6.14">difference anyhow but you could see</text>
  <text start="239.24" dur="6.18">their mindset they didn&amp;#39;t care that it</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="4.33">was gonna whatever it was gonna cost</text>
  <text start="245.42" dur="5.39">whatever the people had to pay for this</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="7.4">fake Russian collusion they didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="6.52">now we see that Comey was grilled and</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="5.379">they were talking about what was going</text>
  <text start="257.33" dur="5.13">on with everything and we can see that</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="5.071">the federal investigators from the DC US</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="5.7">Attorney&amp;#39;s Office interviewed FBI</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.68">director James Comey or former FBI</text>
  <text start="268.16" dur="4.59">director James Comey as part of</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="5.25">non-going probe into whether former FBI</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="4.8">Andrew McCabe broke the law when he lied</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="3.93">to federal agents now what makes this</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="4.44">interview particularly interesting is</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="4.56">that Comey mccabe have given conflicting</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="4.41">reports over the events leading up to</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="5.969">McCabe&amp;#39;s firing with Comey calling his</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="4.71">former deputy a liar in April and the</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="4.291">Justice Department Inspector General</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="4.71">Michael Horowitz issued a criminal</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.2">referral for McCabe following</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="4.22">months-long probe which found that the</text>
  <text start="298.16" dur="4.38">former acting FBI director leaked a</text>
  <text start="300.04" dur="3.28">self-serving story to the press then</text>
  <text start="302.54" dur="3.54">lied about it</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="5.22">under oath now McCabe he was fired back</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.35">on March 16th after Horowitz found that</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="4.68">he had made an under unauthorized</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.799">disclosure to news media and lack candor</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="5.58">including under oath on multiple</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="5.911">occasions specifically McCabe was fired</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="5.31">for lying about authorizing</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="5.12">an FBI spokesman an attorney to tell</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="4.71">Devlin Barrett of the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="5.23">Journal just days before the 2016</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="4.8">election that the FBI had not put the</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="4.17">brakes on a separate investigation into</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="4.41">the Clinton Foundation at a time which</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="8.25">McCabe was coming under fire for his</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="8.88">wife taking 460 that 460 $7,500 campaign</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="5.52">contribution from Clinton pal Terry</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="4.05">McAuliffe so McCabe was found to have</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.11">leaked information to the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="4.53">Journal in order to combat rumors that</text>
  <text start="353.54" dur="3.66">Clinton had indirectly bribed him to</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="3.6">back off the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="3.75">investigation and then lied about it</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="5.27">four times to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="6.24">and FBI including twice under oath and</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="5.2">we could see that Comey basically is</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="6.12">throwing McCabe under the bus right now</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="6.6">and pushing him out there and again what</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re doing is they are protecting</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="4.44">themselves and they&amp;#39;re gonna be pointing</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="3.96">fingers at each other because guess what</text>
  <text start="380.6" dur="4.62">they don&amp;#39;t want to be held responsible</text>
  <text start="381.95" dur="6.8">for what happened so we see right now</text>
  <text start="385.22" dur="5.91">their entire story&amp;#39;s breaking down and</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.84">they&amp;#39;re pointing fingers at each other</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="6.45">and this is just going to get worse over</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="6.21">time now something else came up the FBI</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="4.2">released new documents Friday showing</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="5.13">Hillary&amp;#39;s State Department pitched a</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="6.56">Benghazi story to a Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="5.55">reporter who enthusiastically complied</text>
  <text start="408.34" dur="4.72">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s State Department gave</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="4.74">stand-down orders to Special Op forces</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="4.5">ready to go in and help Americans who</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="5.1">were surrounded by hundreds of Islamic</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="5.97">insurgents in Benghazi in Libya on</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="5.82">September 11th and 12th of 2012 we lost</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="5.1">four Americans that night Tyrone woods</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="6.06">shawnsmith ambassador Christopher</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="7.71">Stevens and Glen Doherty and these</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="7.41">individuals they were sacrificed for the</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="5.04">deep state agenda and again the Obama</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="3.99">ministration they lied about the Omega</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="3.93">Benghazi attack they blamed it on a</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="3.72">YouTube video which really had nothing</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="3.75">to do with this whatsoever Hillary</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="4.02">Clinton also lied straight to the</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="4.35">parents of the victims of min Ghazi the</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="3.25">parents of the two of the Americans</text>
  <text start="453.41" dur="2.86">killed sued Hill</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="4.02">in federal court claiming she is liable</text>
  <text start="456.27" dur="4.98">for their deaths Hillary State</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="4.47">Department shopped a Benghazi story to</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.56">The Wall Street Journal to try to</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="4.71">counter everything that was going on and</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="5.07">actually to put their spin their</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="6">narrative to tell the narrative of what</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="5.58">went down and again this was their</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="4.86">narrative to cover up everything that</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="3.9">really happened and this is what the</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="3.57">deep state does it&amp;#39;s called propaganda</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it for quite a while</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="4.95">they control the media they&amp;#39;ll get the</text>
  <text start="485.58" dur="3.12">corporate media to go along with</text>
  <text start="487.17" dur="2.85">whatever they&amp;#39;re saying the corporate</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="3.15">media will not investigate anything</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ll just take what they say and</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;ll put it out there just like Obama</text>
  <text start="493.71" dur="3.45">was out there saying it was a YouTube</text>
  <text start="495.39" dur="3.3">video that actually did this and this</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="6.36">had nothing to do with it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="8.97">now Google they were going to work with</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="6.96">the Pentagon on an AI contract and they</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="6.03">tried to hide the scope of the project</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="6.27">and there were some leaked emails that</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="5.94">got out and the size of the project was</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="5.67">much much larger than they were telling</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="6.48">everyone and basically what they were</text>
  <text start="522.42" dur="5.58">saying is that this project was only</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.44">about nine million dollars with the</text>
  <text start="528" dur="5.37">Pentagon to come up with these AI type</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="6.6">of drone systems but internal company</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="6.18">emails from September 2017 obtained by</text>
  <text start="537.15" dur="5.61">the intercept well that shows a</text>
  <text start="539.55" dur="4.98">completely different story what that</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="4.08">shows is that the deal would rake in</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="4.62">around 15 million over the next 18</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="3.66">months the email also said that the</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="6">budget of the program was expected to</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="7.5">eventually expand to 250 million the</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="4.74">emails also show the Google executives</text>
  <text start="558" dur="3.9">were deeply concerned about potential</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="3.99">public backlash if the company&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="5.82">participation in the Pentagon program</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="7.02">became widely known now Google employees</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="6">they started a petition and they got</text>
  <text start="570.9" dur="6.45">around 4,000 signatures within the</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="6.27">company to basically shut this project</text>
  <text start="577.35" dur="4.92">maven down and it looks like it has</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="4.95">worked because Google they have</text>
  <text start="582.27" dur="5.88">abandoned the Pentagon&amp;#39;s AI drone</text>
  <text start="584.94" dur="5.55">project so they were trying to</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="4.26">what they were really doing and probably</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="3.6">if we go into their records and go deep</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="5.58">into many of these companies like</text>
  <text start="594.09" dur="6.84">Facebook YouTube Google Twitter and the</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="5.16">rest we would find a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="600.93" dur="4.86">involvement with the intelligence</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="4.14">agencies with other projects with a lot</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="4.05">of grant money going into these</text>
  <text start="607.29" dur="5.28">companies and we can see that these</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="5.79">companies are used to gather data to spy</text>
  <text start="612.57" dur="4.44">on the American people and a lot of its</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="4.17">coming out and there&amp;#39;s a lot of class</text>
  <text start="617.01" dur="5.16">action lawsuits going on right now with</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="4.53">Facebook and many other companies</text>
  <text start="622.17" dur="4.56">because people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="624.33" dur="5.49">what they have been doing now it looks</text>
  <text start="626.73" dur="6.51">like Trump and the North Korean official</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="5.16">they got together they handed Trump a</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="4.65">letter from the country&amp;#39;s leader Kim</text>
  <text start="634.98" dur="7.79">jong-un and now it looks like the summit</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="7.62">is back on in Singapore on June 12th and</text>
  <text start="642.77" dur="4.45">we see at this point this is all moving</text>
  <text start="645.51" dur="4.2">forward this is exactly what we thought</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="4.05">was going to happen and it is happening</text>
  <text start="649.71" dur="3.42">even though the deep state was trying to</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="2.4">do whatever they possibly could to shut</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="2.67">this down</text>
  <text start="653.67" dur="5.55">they might even still try something in</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="5.79">Singapore which they might you know have</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="4.89">someone because we know they can control</text>
  <text start="661.59" dur="4.53">innocence we know that they might try</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="4.74">something there where they might have</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="6.9">someone explode something or something</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="5.7">else might occur in this area to shut</text>
  <text start="673.02" dur="3.6">this whole thing down but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="674.55" dur="4.23">wait to see and we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="676.62" dur="3.84">of news coming out right now a lot of</text>
  <text start="678.78" dur="2.88">information coming out and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="680.46" dur="4.26">to want to shut everything down</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="5.49">especially the IG report where the</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="4.53">Senate is going to review this we also</text>
  <text start="687.15" dur="3.63">see the peace talks we also see things</text>
  <text start="689.25" dur="2.88">happening in Syria and Afghanistan so</text>
  <text start="690.78" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening right</text>
  <text start="692.13" dur="4.26">now that they do not want to happen we</text>
  <text start="694.95" dur="3.99">see the US ambassador to the United</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="5.7">Nations nikki Haley I do believe she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="4.56">part of the deep State she vetoed a UN</text>
  <text start="702.09" dur="3.02">draft resolution calling for the</text>
  <text start="703.5" dur="4.23">international mission to protect</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="5.2">Palestinian Palestinian civilians in the</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="3.87">Gaza Strip they wanted to have an</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="4.56">investigation of what was really going</text>
  <text start="711.6" dur="6.57">on there and basically nikki Haley said</text>
  <text start="714.87" dur="4.77">no way and she does this quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="3.54">I do believe she&amp;#39;s part of the deep</text>
  <text start="719.64" dur="5.43">state part of the system</text>
  <text start="721.71" dur="5.7">and basically the u.s. normally shuts</text>
  <text start="725.07" dur="3.48">these things down where they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="727.41" dur="5.34">anyone looking at anything especially</text>
  <text start="728.55" dur="5.76">like out in Syria where they Russia and</text>
  <text start="732.75" dur="4.08">other countries wanted to have an</text>
  <text start="734.31" dur="4.2">investigation usually nikki Haley is out</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="3.36">usually out there saying no we should</text>
  <text start="738.51" dur="3.78">not have an investigation the OPCW</text>
  <text start="740.19" dur="4.11">should not go out to that area and</text>
  <text start="742.29" dur="4.62">investigate we should just you know</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="4.71">collect social media findings and make a</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="3.78">determination if chemical weapons were</text>
  <text start="749.01" dur="3.57">actually used and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="750.69" dur="4.8">keep doing this is because they know</text>
  <text start="752.58" dur="6.27">what the team would find if they</text>
  <text start="755.49" dur="6.27">actually visited Gaza if they actually</text>
  <text start="758.85" dur="4.62">visited Syria if they actually visited</text>
  <text start="761.76" dur="4.5">all these different places they would</text>
  <text start="763.47" dur="4.65">know exactly what was going on and they</text>
  <text start="766.26" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t want this information coming out</text>
  <text start="768.12" dur="6">there so they continually shut it all</text>
  <text start="770.49" dur="6.9">down we see right now that there are</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="5.34">satellite images of the altom base and</text>
  <text start="777.39" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s a before and after and before</text>
  <text start="779.46" dur="4.47">the base was pretty much nothing and it</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="4.71">has grown and grown and grown over time</text>
  <text start="783.93" dur="6.99">and we know right now that Syria and</text>
  <text start="786.63" dur="7.77">Russia and Jordan and the US there are</text>
  <text start="790.92" dur="6.96">negotiations and Syria wants this base</text>
  <text start="794.4" dur="6.57">turned over and we can see that there</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="4.89">are negotiations moving forward and I</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="3.81">believe all these negotiations that are</text>
  <text start="802.77" dur="4.32">behind the scenes they are to bring</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="4.62">peace to this area and to remove the</text>
  <text start="807.09" dur="4.77">troops from Afghanistan we moved from</text>
  <text start="809.4" dur="4.74">Syria we moved from Iraq because at this</text>
  <text start="811.86" dur="4.62">point there is no reason for any of the</text>
  <text start="814.14" dur="4.83">coalition forces to be in Syria it is a</text>
  <text start="816.48" dur="4.89">sovereign country actually the coalition</text>
  <text start="818.97" dur="4.65">forces invaded this country under false</text>
  <text start="821.37" dur="5.36">pretenses to say that they were fighting</text>
  <text start="823.62" dur="5.96">an enemy that they supported that they</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="5.8">supported funded and put in there and</text>
  <text start="829.58" dur="5.95">rather be found out what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="832.53" dur="5.79">to do is basically remove the troops</text>
  <text start="835.53" dur="4.23">under different circumstances and this</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="3.84">is why they&amp;#39;re having this negotiation</text>
  <text start="839.76" dur="4.17">this is why Trump actually said the</text>
  <text start="842.16" dur="4.17">troops will be withdrawn from these</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="5.55">countries this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="846.33" dur="6.78">push a different agenda and have these</text>
  <text start="849.48" dur="5.79">negotiations and if Iran leaves that</text>
  <text start="853.11" dur="2.37">will allow the u.s. to say okay there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.27" dur="2.1">no</text>
  <text start="855.48" dur="3.78">real reason for us to be there and it</text>
  <text start="857.37" dur="3.3">will give them the excuse to pull the</text>
  <text start="859.26" dur="3.3">troops out and I think this is what</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re trying to do at this point just</text>
  <text start="862.56" dur="3.779">like we saw in North Korea a lot of</text>
  <text start="864.24" dur="4.77">these talks happen behind the scenes to</text>
  <text start="866.339" dur="4.261">bring peace to the region and we see at</text>
  <text start="869.01" dur="5.069">this point the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="870.6" dur="6.06">in all these area areas and we also see</text>
  <text start="874.079" dur="4.471">the Russian naval ships they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="876.66" dur="5.01">leaving leaving the Syrian waters</text>
  <text start="878.55" dur="6.11">there&amp;#39;s no more threat to this area I</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="5.789">mean this tells you that the</text>
  <text start="884.66" dur="4.359">negotiations they&amp;#39;re moving in the right</text>
  <text start="887.459" dur="3.361">direction and there are other</text>
  <text start="889.019" dur="3.18">negotiations going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="890.82" dur="4.769">because we see the frigate Admiral</text>
  <text start="892.199" dur="5.371">grigoryevich that is leaving the Syrian</text>
  <text start="895.589" dur="4.471">waters with other ships and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="5.79">sailing back to the Black Sea which</text>
  <text start="900.06" dur="6.589">tells you that they don&amp;#39;t need these</text>
  <text start="903.36" dur="7.229">ships there to patrol the areas and</text>
  <text start="906.649" dur="6.971">again what we see happening right now is</text>
  <text start="910.589" dur="6.451">the deep state they are losing their</text>
  <text start="913.62" dur="5.579">grip on the entire area and it&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="917.04" dur="4.38">matter of time now</text>
  <text start="919.199" dur="4.591">again the deep state still has control</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="4.169">in certain areas they have control of</text>
  <text start="923.79" dur="3.9">the corporate media there are still</text>
  <text start="925.589" dur="3.87">pushing certain agendas they believe</text>
  <text start="927.69" dur="3">that they&amp;#39;re still going to hit their</text>
  <text start="929.459" dur="3.391">goals this is why sources out there</text>
  <text start="930.69" dur="4.56">trying to get the refugees from Africa</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="4.229">to move into the European countries</text>
  <text start="935.25" dur="3.389">because they lost their refugees from</text>
  <text start="937.079" dur="3.12">Syria and Iraq because these people are</text>
  <text start="938.639" dur="3.151">returning back to their countries and</text>
  <text start="940.199" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re losing their grip but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="941.79" dur="3.63">trying to figure out other ways where</text>
  <text start="943.529" dur="5.401">they can still push their goal to have</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="4.89">blended countries and a one-world</text>
  <text start="948.93" dur="4.019">government they&amp;#39;re not going to give up</text>
  <text start="950.31" dur="5.219">that easily and we can see that as we</text>
  <text start="952.949" dur="6.26">move forward they don&amp;#39;t like peace they</text>
  <text start="955.529" dur="6.12">want war they want turmoil they want</text>
  <text start="959.209" dur="4.87">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in the</text>
  <text start="961.649" dur="5.12">last couple of years to continue so they</text>
  <text start="964.079" dur="5.431">can bring their one-world government and</text>
  <text start="966.769" dur="4.961">they&amp;#39;re still pushing this agenda they</text>
  <text start="969.51" dur="4.5">need a war to move to their new system</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="5.21">and the whole thing&amp;#39;s falling apart for</text>
  <text start="974.01" dur="5.819">them which means that they might try</text>
  <text start="976.94" dur="4.899">something we might see an event and I</text>
  <text start="979.829" dur="3.69">think these distractions they might be</text>
  <text start="981.839" dur="3.391">small distractions they might be larger</text>
  <text start="983.519" dur="3.18">distractions but they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="985.23" dur="3.39">continually do this of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.699" dur="3.871">going to use their emotional reporting</text>
  <text start="988.62" dur="4.44">to try to drag everyone into their</text>
  <text start="990.57" dur="3.72">direction of oh my god this is racist</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="2.64">this is that and this is this and</text>
  <text start="994.29" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ll just keep pushing that out there</text>
  <text start="995.7" dur="4.5">so you can believe it and they&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="997.77" dur="4.08">doing this because it goes to the</text>
  <text start="1000.2" dur="4.14">emotion of people and that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1001.85" dur="6">use to get people all hot and bothered</text>
  <text start="1004.34" dur="5.25">about a subject and let instead of</text>
  <text start="1007.85" dur="3.63">looking at what is really going on and</text>
  <text start="1009.59" dur="3.39">what they really been doing out in these</text>
  <text start="1011.48" dur="2.97">countries where they have been having</text>
  <text start="1012.98" dur="2.82">regime change and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1014.45" dur="3">supporting terrorists and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1015.8" dur="2.73">doing all these other things so right</text>
  <text start="1017.45" dur="2.52">now we&amp;#39;re gonna seize little</text>
  <text start="1018.53" dur="3.33">distractions we&amp;#39;re gonna be larger</text>
  <text start="1019.97" dur="4.92">distractions we&amp;#39;re gonna see all of it</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="5.28">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they get</text>
  <text start="1024.89" dur="4.04">larger and larger as time goes on and</text>
  <text start="1027.14" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of this as</text>
