  <text start="35.71" dur="5.279">a and today&amp;#39;s date is May second 2016</text>
  <text start="38.62" dur="4.02">and thought of the episode is US</text>
  <text start="40.989" dur="4.081">government warns Congress Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="42.64" dur="5.01">needs a bailout or we are all doomed</text>
  <text start="45.07" dur="4.98">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.65" dur="4.32">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="50.05" dur="3.95">looking at economic indicators not just</text>
  <text start="51.97" dur="5.729">here in the US but in Canada Australia</text>
  <text start="54" dur="7.089">UK throughout Europe and we are noticing</text>
  <text start="57.699" dur="6.631">that these economic indicators they are</text>
  <text start="61.089" dur="5.131">pointing downward we&amp;#39;re in a downward</text>
  <text start="64.33" dur="4.23">trend at this point and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.22" dur="4.679">accelerating it&amp;#39;s not improving the</text>
  <text start="68.56" dur="4.199">other way and I believe we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="70.899" dur="3.811">starting to realize is ness there are</text>
  <text start="72.759" dur="3.78">certain people out there that still are</text>
  <text start="74.71" dur="4.32">holding on to the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="76.539" dur="6">government the president who&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="79.03" dur="5.21">that the economy is doing fine but the</text>
  <text start="82.539" dur="3.991">facts are the facts are the facts and</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.42">people can come out and say yes the</text>
  <text start="86.53" dur="4.74">economy is fine but you better have a</text>
  <text start="88.66" dur="4.89">lot of facts behind it and even the</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="3.959">facts from the government aren&amp;#39;t panning</text>
  <text start="93.55" dur="4.019">out anymore because we can go through</text>
  <text start="95.229" dur="4.291">those facts and we can see where things</text>
  <text start="97.569" dur="3.39">have been manipulated and this is the</text>
  <text start="99.52" dur="4.14">problem that everyone is having right</text>
  <text start="100.959" dur="6.781">now and a lot of the financial pundants</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="7.049">a lot of investors they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="107.74" dur="5.28">realize that things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="110.709" dur="3.871">apart and they they know this and this</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="3.87">is why we&amp;#39;re starting to see gold move</text>
  <text start="114.58" dur="3.66">up at this point now if we look at</text>
  <text start="116.89" dur="3.41">retail sales we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="118.24" dur="4.769">retail there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="120.3" dur="4.9">decline in many areas now in the US</text>
  <text start="123.009" dur="3.72">retail has been declining for quite a</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="4.08">while we see in Canada we see it in</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="5.911">Australia we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Swiss</text>
  <text start="129.28" dur="4.92">Switzerland where retail sales have</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="5.34">declined by one-point-three percent in</text>
  <text start="134.2" dur="5.85">March and you know again they were</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="5.04">expecting it to be a lot better and of</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="5.61">course it wasn&amp;#39;t and we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="5.13">EU the same thing happening now of</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="4.409">course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="3.479">government&amp;#39;s they all like to spin it</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="4.621">that everything is fine that everything</text>
  <text start="151.629" dur="5.071">is going well they did this back in 2013</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.23">I mentioned this many many times where</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="4.68">they try to convince us that there in</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.92">this incredible recovery which never</text>
  <text start="161.38" dur="4.65">appeared because here we are in 2016</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="3.84">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="5.37">the eurozone factory growth it has</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="6.9">weakened in April and Europe they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="171.4" dur="4.77">the verge of collapse right now and what</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="4.049">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that there&amp;#39;s a decline</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="4.83">in productivity and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="178.629" dur="4.321">problems for the EU labour productivity</text>
  <text start="181" dur="4.799">and the EU has slowed since the global</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="5.22">financial crisis and there is little</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="6.3">probability that the law the five</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="5.73">largest EU economies will recover back</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="5.72">to the way they were it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="6.78">impossible we see Spain Italy their</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="5.471">productivity has stagnated since 2014</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="6.05">and one of the biggest problems for the</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="7.47">EU is of course the migrant crisis and</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="7.39">we can see that this crisis throughout</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="6.72">the EU we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="5.22">this since World War two more than a</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="4.14">million refugees arrived in Europe and</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="3.929">the EU is still struggling to solve the</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="4.56">problem in the least painful way</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="4.831">possible at this point but from</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.649">everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="4.979">dead is too high the economies are going</text>
  <text start="230.829" dur="5.671">nowhere people are being unemployed</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re manipulating the statistical</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="4.98">numbers just like the u.s. they have</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="6.421">negative interest rates they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="6.72">corporate debt and they&amp;#39;re continuing</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="5.549">with these policies where it is going</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="4.56">absolutely nowhere here in the United</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="5.911">States we see Chevron Corp filleting off</text>
  <text start="252.76" dur="7.68">a thousand people and us home ownership</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="8.55">right now it is at its lowest level</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="8.37">since the Johnson administration now of</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="6.45">course as we know the housing market is</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="5.82">one gigantic bubble and the way the way</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="5.31">they created the bubble is they kept</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="4.14">houses off the market so there was no</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="3.36">inventory this is why you keep hearing</text>
  <text start="278.77" dur="3.24">people well there&amp;#39;s no inventory and the</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="3.83">prices are going up and people have</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="5.279">nothing to buy they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.36">because first of all there&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="2.911">people out there to purchase all these</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="3.839">homes think about all the toxic real</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="4.38">estate that the Fed has purchased think</text>
  <text start="292.599" dur="4.141">about all the foreclosures that the</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.09">banks have on their books that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="2.16">not releasing</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="5.79">into the public because if they do</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="8.22">housing prices will not go up they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="4.77">have the bubble effect and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="3.93">seeing right now is the everyday</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="6.63">American they can&amp;#39;t afford these homes</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="7.32">and the home ownership rate shows us</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="7.61">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on here is that the</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="7.29">everyday American is not purchasing it</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="6.06">is investment companies foreign</text>
  <text start="325.66" dur="7.47">investors taking the free money and</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="8.53">using it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="6.63">is that the housing market it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="6.93">ready to implode they cannot keep this</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="6.06">up and the next generation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="4.47">living with their parents they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="6.78">even find the jobs to save the money to</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="5.58">purchase a house and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="352.6" dur="6.21">right now that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="354.04" dur="7.05">full-on disaster you think 2008 housing</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="6.74">crisis was a disaster this is going to</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="9.05">be 10 times worse add in everything else</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="6.82">this whole thing is going to implode now</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="5.28">manufacturing it has not gotten better</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="6.75">at all markets final manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="7.69">printed at 50.8 its lowest since</text>
  <text start="379.12" dur="6.15">September of 2009 that was the year that</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="6.03">we were in the height of the Great</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="8.04">Recession new orders weakened job</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="7.11">creation tumbled and the April&amp;#39;s PMI</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="4.89">data suggests there is no end end in</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="6.63">sight to the current downturn in</text>
  <text start="398.2" dur="6.57">manufacturing activity so when people</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="5.76">say well manufacturing is going to be</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="7.29">bouncing back no it is not everything is</text>
  <text start="408.64" dur="6">connected if the people aren&amp;#39;t working</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="4.16">they don&amp;#39;t have the high-paying jobs and</text>
  <text start="414.64" dur="5.19">we continually see more and more layoffs</text>
  <text start="416.22" dur="5.08">guess what you can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="3.12">statistical numbers all you want and</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="5.66">tell us there&amp;#39;s two percent unemployment</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="6.89">rate it&amp;#39;s not going to make a difference</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="4.06">because the people aren&amp;#39;t working and</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="3.19">have the</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="4.619">that the high-paying jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="5.28">making the money to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="4.77">in retail this is why we see retail</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.829">contracting this is why we see</text>
  <text start="440.409" dur="8.491">manufacturing contracting this is why we</text>
  <text start="443.139" dur="8.761">see it all imploding now Schwab they are</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="5.28">doing something very interesting they</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="5.97">started informing their clients that</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="7.019">between june and october of 2016 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="6.87">going to be updating the cash feature on</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="5.761">the accounts from the current retail</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="4.23">prime or municipal money market fund</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="5.519">sweep to the schwab government money</text>
  <text start="468.97" dur="6.509">fund but what does that mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="5.97">going to invest 99.5 percent of its</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="8.011">total assets in cash and US government</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="6.421">securities which is Treasuries and at</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="3.179">least eighty percent of the funds net</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="5.4">assets will be invested all in</text>
  <text start="486.669" dur="5.701">Treasuries so in other words Schwab is</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="4.47">telegraphing that brokerages have been</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="4.59">begun permanently unwinding hundreds of</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="4.41">billions if not trillions in money</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="5.81">market funds and rotating it almost</text>
  <text start="499.15" dur="7.25">entirely into government securities</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="7.509">because more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="5.949">selling their Treasuries someone&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="510.279" dur="5.611">to take up the slack now the Fed could</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="5.841">do it but it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="6">to force this on the peoples investments</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="7.99">retirement funds like the my IRA which</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="7.35">of course Obama put out there and that</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="4.59">would be made up of Treasuries and it</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.11">looks like they&amp;#39;re doing the switch at</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="4.68">this point because as we can see more</text>
  <text start="533.35" dur="3.9">and more countries are unloading it</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="5.9">looks like Saudi Arabia wanted to unload</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="6.72">some of their assets China is unloading</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="5.92">many other countries are unloading and</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="7.08">we see at this point that as this picks</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="6.15">up they need a place to put them they</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="4.02">need buyers and it looks like all of</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="3.859">these funds are going to be the buyers</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="7.29">and they&amp;#39;re going to be worthless as</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="9.941">time goes on now Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="7.8">it looks like they are defaulting and we</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="8.16">see that Puerto Rico governor says won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="9.57">pay debt tomorrow and right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="7.44">looking for some type of bailout and we</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="6.51">see Jack Lew he sent a letter to</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="5.329">Congress warning that if Puerto Rico you</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="4.589">know is not fixed in an orderly manner</text>
  <text start="588.149" dur="5.891">the nation the nation will face</text>
  <text start="590.829" dur="5.611">cascading defaults basically saying</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re doomed if this doesn&amp;#39;t happen now</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="5.07">they said this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="5.82">eight if you all remember when they were</text>
  <text start="601.51" dur="4.68">in front of Congress asking for bailouts</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="6.81">for all the corporations and now we have</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="8.28">Puerto Rico defaulting and here we are</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="6.18">once again now we&amp;#39;re all doomed no</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="5.82">matter what and I don&amp;#39;t mean to sound</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="4.74">doom and gloom but what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="6.239">tracking and what we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="6.45">and looking at is telling us that this</text>
  <text start="626.529" dur="5.881">economy it doesn&amp;#39;t matter at this point</text>
  <text start="628.36" dur="7.62">if we bail out puerto rico or not</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="5.22">because the debt is unsustainable and if</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s not Puerto Rico it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="4.05">something else that brings down the</text>
  <text start="639.37" dur="4.5">entire economy what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="641.68" dur="5.96">they&amp;#39;re plugging the holes of the dam</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="7.709">each leak with tape spit and gum and</text>
  <text start="647.64" dur="6.1">each time the water is breaking through</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="4.741">and eventually you know what happens the</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="5.07">damn comes down they cannot maintain</text>
  <text start="656.32" dur="7.769">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="7.08">right now that the five economies</text>
  <text start="664.089" dur="5.701">including China Japan Germany South</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="6.21">Korea and Taiwan do not devalue your</text>
  <text start="669.79" dur="4.32">currency because it looks like the u.s.</text>
  <text start="672.1" dur="4.65">is going to be doing that at this point</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="5.28">to try to prop up the system once again</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="4.92">and as they continually devalue what</text>
  <text start="679.39" dur="4.559">happens to gold well that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="681.67" dur="4.68">continually rise and this is something</text>
  <text start="683.949" dur="4.741">to watch and it&amp;#39;s going to make it more</text>
  <text start="686.35" dur="4.799">and more difficult for them to suppress</text>
  <text start="688.69" dur="5.19">gold as we go forward now I thought they</text>
  <text start="691.149" dur="4.771">were going to suppress it by today we</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="2.939">saw gold went up a little bit it popped</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="2.969">over 13</text>
  <text start="696.819" dur="4.08">drupa came back down they might do a</text>
  <text start="698.889" dur="5.25">Tuesday or Wednesday and we have to see</text>
  <text start="700.899" dur="5.67">how big this flash crash is going to be</text>
  <text start="704.139" dur="4.89">because this is a signal letting us know</text>
  <text start="706.569" dur="4.26">as gold continually rises a lot of</text>
  <text start="709.029" dur="3.691">people gonna say hmm something&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="710.829" dur="3.36">on here I better start getting into hard</text>
  <text start="712.72" dur="3.569">assets we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of sellers</text>
  <text start="714.189" dur="4.56">in the stock market and this is</text>
  <text start="716.289" dur="4.11">something to watch as we go forward</text>
  <text start="718.749" dur="3.75">because when we see gold moving up a</text>
  <text start="720.399" dur="4.35">hundred one hundred and fifty two</text>
  <text start="722.499" dur="4.65">hundred dollars well this is the endgame</text>
  <text start="724.749" dur="6.06">people this is where you need to start</text>
  <text start="727.149" dur="6.15">taking cover and the dollar is tanking</text>
  <text start="730.809" dur="6.21">right now from a high around one hundred</text>
  <text start="733.299" dur="5.76">and December the dollar index which is</text>
  <text start="737.019" dur="4.05">measured against different foreign</text>
  <text start="739.059" dur="5.94">currencies is down about eight percent</text>
  <text start="741.069" dur="6.93">and it is declining and it is</text>
  <text start="744.999" dur="4.8">accelerating but a weak dollar by</text>
  <text start="747.999" dur="4.02">definition means a strong euro and yen</text>
  <text start="749.799" dur="4.68">and those economies are totally</text>
  <text start="752.019" dur="4.62">unprepared for their exports to become</text>
  <text start="754.479" dur="3.3">pricier and therefore harder to move now</text>
  <text start="756.639" dur="3.93">will they sit around and just say okay</text>
  <text start="757.779" dur="5.1">you devalue the dollar and we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="760.569" dur="4.35">sit back and our economies will implode</text>
  <text start="762.879" dur="4.29">know what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="764.919" dur="5.31">going to devalue their currency this is</text>
  <text start="767.169" dur="6.33">the currency war and it&amp;#39;s gearing up</text>
  <text start="770.229" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s accelerating and hold on to your</text>
  <text start="773.499" dur="4.92">seats because we see trade wars already</text>
  <text start="775.899" dur="5.12">we see the currency wars picking up we</text>
  <text start="778.419" dur="4.92">see gold moving up to the upside</text>
  <text start="781.019" dur="4.63">everything is starting at this point now</text>
  <text start="783.339" dur="5.09">very interestingly we know that Saudi</text>
  <text start="785.649" dur="6.39">Arabia has been pumping a lot of oil</text>
  <text start="788.429" dur="5.62">putting pressure on Russia and we know</text>
  <text start="792.039" dur="5.1">the United States has talked to Saudi</text>
  <text start="794.049" dur="5.34">Arabia into doing this Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="797.139" dur="3.54">hurting right now they want to sell some</text>
  <text start="799.389" dur="4.56">of their assets they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="800.679" dur="6.21">different ways to reignite their economy</text>
  <text start="803.949" dur="4.41">and the US says no you will not be doing</text>
  <text start="806.889" dur="3.72">any of this and this is why they were</text>
  <text start="808.359" dur="4.26">threatening with those 28 pages but we</text>
  <text start="810.609" dur="4.77">see all this oil is being pumped and</text>
  <text start="812.619" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re seeing 83 super tankers carrying</text>
  <text start="815.379" dur="5.58">about about 166 million barrels of oil</text>
  <text start="818.049" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;re headed to China and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="820.959" dur="8.831">stockpiling oil just like they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="825.519" dur="7.481">stockpiling gold now they have the high</text>
  <text start="829.79" dur="6.33">stockpiling weight since 2014 and this</text>
  <text start="833" dur="6.48">started the beginning of the year so</text>
  <text start="836.12" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re building huge underground</text>
  <text start="839.48" dur="7.68">storage tanks to hold all this excess</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="7.14">oil so a couple things are happening</text>
  <text start="847.16" dur="6.09">right now first the Chinese they realize</text>
  <text start="851" dur="4.32">that oil is going to be going back up in</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="3.62">price just like gold so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="5.03">to get as much as they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="856.87" dur="7.63">they&amp;#39;re very worried about a disruption</text>
  <text start="860.35" dur="6.88">due to geopolitical reasons which might</text>
  <text start="864.5" dur="4.89">propel oil prices higher and it might be</text>
  <text start="867.23" dur="6.17">hard to find oil at this point in time</text>
  <text start="869.39" dur="7.02">and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="873.4" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re doing this because we know</text>
  <text start="876.41" dur="6.44">what&amp;#39;s coming the collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="879.35" dur="8.39">the u.s. continually provoking war and</text>
  <text start="882.85" dur="7.66">Russia China and the other BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="887.74" dur="6.31">they realize what&amp;#39;s going on at this</text>
  <text start="890.51" dur="5.1">point and people say well maybe the</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="3.18">central bank you know they&amp;#39;ll do what</text>
  <text start="895.61" dur="4.86">they did before and the economy will be</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="5">pumped up once again well yes are they</text>
  <text start="900.47" dur="5.04">going to create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="902.23" dur="5.41">yes most likely but they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="905.51" dur="5.37">to add on to the debt will they try to</text>
  <text start="907.64" dur="4.77">lower interest rates yes most likely but</text>
  <text start="910.88" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s not going to help the situation I</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="4.92">mean look Europe Japan their in- already</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s not going to help it will inflate</text>
  <text start="917.33" dur="3.48">the bubbles a little bit but people are</text>
  <text start="919.16" dur="3.48">going to lose confidence and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="920.81" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now can they may be</text>
  <text start="922.64" dur="3.57">late statistical numbers of course they</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="3.27">can but again if they manipulate an</text>
  <text start="926.21" dur="3.69">unemployment and they tell you it&amp;#39;s 1.5%</text>
  <text start="927.74" dur="3.96">right now does it really matter if</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="3.21">everyone&amp;#39;s out of work they can show all</text>
  <text start="931.7" dur="3.75">the numbers they want it will make no</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="6.27">difference at that point and at this</text>
  <text start="935.45" dur="5.76">point everyone should be purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="3.39">and silver because it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="941.21" dur="3.18">time I think in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="942.77" dur="4.35">months that it&amp;#39;s going to be impossible</text>
  <text start="944.39" dur="4.56">to find or get where the prices are</text>
  <text start="947.12" dur="5.39">going to be too high and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="948.95" dur="3.56">push people right out of the market I</text>
  <text start="952.66" dur="7.08">think people need to get their food</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="8">right now water batteries toiletries</text>
  <text start="959.74" dur="6.27">because at this point</text>
  <text start="962.74" dur="5.94">things are rapidly falling apart and if</text>
  <text start="966.01" dur="5.04">you haven&amp;#39;t started I would start don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="968.68" dur="4.529">make yourself nervous just go out and</text>
  <text start="971.05" dur="5.55">start purchasing the goods just do it</text>
  <text start="973.209" dur="4.981">every week set a little side and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="976.6" dur="5.25">all you have to do just keep doing it</text>
  <text start="978.19" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t think about it just do it if you</text>
  <text start="981.85" dur="2.7">haven&amp;#39;t started and you want to get a</text>
  <text start="983.08" dur="4.5">jump on it you can go to life alliance</text>
  <text start="984.55" dur="5.49">com they have water filtration systems</text>
  <text start="987.58" dur="4.89">they have emergency foods that you can</text>
  <text start="990.04" dur="4.83">customize your order and they&amp;#39;ll send it</text>
  <text start="992.47" dur="6.84">right to you but no matter which way you</text>
  <text start="994.87" dur="6.719">do this we&amp;#39;re going to see the economy</text>
  <text start="999.31" dur="6.06">implode and accelerate as we move</text>
  <text start="1001.589" dur="6.87">forward and it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="1005.37" dur="6.17">worse as we map this it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="1008.459" dur="5.19">improve it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="4.15">because what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing since the</text>
  <text start="1013.649" dur="4.291">beginning we&amp;#39;ve seen some pop ups but</text>
  <text start="1015.69" dur="6.14">every time we see a pop-up it declines</text>
  <text start="1017.94" dur="7.68">even further in the downward trend and</text>
  <text start="1021.83" dur="6.91">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1025.62" dur="5.85">seeing defaults we&amp;#39;re seeing bail-ins in</text>
  <text start="1028.74" dur="7.68">different countries we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1031.47" dur="9.18">bailouts and we see that things are</text>
  <text start="1036.42" dur="6.45">rapidly imploding on itself and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1040.65" dur="4.11">become a point where the US government</text>
  <text start="1042.87" dur="4.589">central bankers they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1044.76" dur="4.62">stop it listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
