  <text start="144.01" dur="7.68">of Ukraine we see out in Iraq Washington</text>

  <text start="151.69" dur="4.59">bolster the fight against yes the</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="6.149">Islamic state now remember the Islamic</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="5.76">state was put into power by the US</text>
  <text start="159.909" dur="4.681">government central bankers they use them</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="5.76">as their proxy army they were going to</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="5.789">used to remove Assad then Russia stepped</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="6.38">in and kind of ruin that entire plan and</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="7.14">we see right now that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="5.949">stepping back reformulating a new plan</text>
  <text start="177.519" dur="5.25">and trying to figure out a way to get</text>
  <text start="180.129" dur="5.551">Assad out now how they created a new</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="7.5">plan yes their plan is in motion right</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="7.86">now we see the Shiite militia forces in</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="5.131">Iraq have strongly opposed the new the</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="5.009">new US troops deployed in the country</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="7.38">they warned Washington that they should</text>
  <text start="198.549" dur="6.181">withdraw their troops out of iraq iraq</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="4.26">is saying we really don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="4.67">troops there but they have given certain</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="5.99">permission for troops to come in and</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="7.839">help out in certain situations now is</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="6.099">the u.s. really helping out well not</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="5.671">really they usually get in the way and</text>
  <text start="219.129" dur="7.2">we see that the the u.s. still has some</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="6.449">pull in Iraq and we see that turkey the</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="5.011">US and other nations they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="229.359" dur="3.571">care what a rack has to say because</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever they want</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.779">no matter what now Assad has come out</text>
  <text start="236.319" dur="7.881">and he is urging all Muslims across the</text>
  <text start="239.709" dur="7.14">world to unite against terrorism and</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="8.74">he&amp;#39;s saying that this is an urgent need</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="9.651">for Muslims to show the world that they</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="6.389">do not accept they do not support any</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="5.979">type of terrorism around the world</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="5.52">whatsoever and I think this was a very</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="4.401">good strategic move on his part because</text>
  <text start="264.849" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s showing that yes the Muslims are</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="6.25">here we don&amp;#39;t support what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="270.039" dur="6.901">and most of the people that are creating</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="7.37">these terrorist acts aren&amp;#39;t even Muslim</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="7.34">they&amp;#39;re paid mercenaries controlled by</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="7.63">government forces by the central bank</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="7.33">now Turkey they made a deal with the EU</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="6.42">and they&amp;#39;re ready to send 25,000</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="5.489">refugees from Syria to the European</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="3.63">Union in exchange for the undocumented</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="4.141">migrants</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="6.359">where they&amp;#39;ve already sent them off to</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="5.58">the EU so now they have documented</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="4.261">migrants and they&amp;#39;re going to give that</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="6.36">to the EU and they&amp;#39;re going to take back</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="7.5">the others and they&amp;#39;re doing a huge</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="4.47">exchange now where did they get these</text>
  <text start="316.3" dur="4.86">documents are they really documented</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="6.48">they just make this up most likely but</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="5.64">we can see right now turkey wants the</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="4.14">funds they lost the revenue from the</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="4.19">Islamic state where they were stealing</text>
  <text start="328.27" dur="4.95">the oil from Syria selling it out to</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="4.929">many different vendors going through</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="5.1">Turkey and that has completely dried up</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="5.701">because Russia came in and destroyed</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="6.719">destroyed the oil convoys which now</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="6.51">leaves turkey without revenue for their</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="7.021">covert operations so they blackmailed</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="6.78">Europe into giving them funds we see</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="5.1">turkey right now has introduced a seven</text>
  <text start="354.91" dur="5.849">district curfew in the southeast of</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="11.09">Turkey and this curfew is on the Kurds</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="10.891">and we see at this point that turkey is</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="8.639">continually provoking and making their</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="9">move to get something started in Syria</text>
  <text start="376.889" dur="5.681">now the u.s. they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="5.22">going to launch their new train and</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="9">equip program to help the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="7.53">Army in Syria now the last training that</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="4.62">they did to help the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="5.549">completely failed or did it because</text>
  <text start="396.19" dur="5.849">really what they did was they trained</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="5.161">soldiers for the Islamic state and while</text>
  <text start="402.039" dur="5.071">they were doing that they trained a</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.339">couple dozen for the free syrian army</text>
  <text start="407.11" dur="7.35">but most of the training was done to</text>
  <text start="409.449" dur="8.671">create the terror groups and as soon as</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="5.699">they trained these individuals they rent</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="6.21">right over to the islamic state or l</text>
  <text start="420.159" dur="6.931">nusrah or al-qaeda and right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="4.709">a problem with that and they can&amp;#39;t train</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="4.049">these individuals to go over to the</text>
  <text start="429.039" dur="2.85">terrorist groups because they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="3.56">destroyed by</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="6.541">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re losing ground</text>
  <text start="434.699" dur="6.911">remember the ceasefire does not pertain</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="5.28">to them so the u.s. is saying okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.44">going to launch the new training and</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="5.639">equip program and we&amp;#39;re actually going</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="4.919">to train the moderate rebels and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="6.391">going to stay as moderate rebels this</text>
  <text start="450.969" dur="9.6">time because they&amp;#39;re not affected by the</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="6.509">bombings from Syria and Russia so we can</text>
  <text start="460.569" dur="3.9">see this is the new approach they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.249" dur="4.621">taking because they realize they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="464.469" dur="6.211">bought themselves some time here and</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="5.789">they&amp;#39;re able to build up the forces now</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="3.449">who&amp;#39;s going to train them most likely</text>
  <text start="472.659" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;ll be training in Turkey Saudi</text>
  <text start="474.129" dur="5.79">Arabia Jordan just like we saw before</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.71">and the troops will come in and this</text>
  <text start="479.919" dur="4.231">time they&amp;#39;ll stay as moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="6.839">this way they can build up the troops in</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="7.739">this area now we understand the peace</text>
  <text start="488.949" dur="6.09">talks are occurring right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.889" dur="4.59">not going that well and it was very</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="4.771">interesting is State Department</text>
  <text start="496.479" dur="5.581">spokesman Kirby outlined the kind of</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="7.259">government the US wants to see in Syria</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="8.879">and he says that they don&amp;#39;t support</text>
  <text start="507.069" dur="8.551">self-rule or semi-autonomous zones</text>
  <text start="510.939" dur="9.54">inside Syria we want to see a unified</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="7.02">whole Syria that has a place that has in</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="5.04">place a government that is not led by</text>
  <text start="522.64" dur="6.9">Assad that is responsive to the Syrian</text>
  <text start="525.519" dur="7.471">people whole unified non-sectarian Syria</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s the goal so the political</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="4.23">transition in Geneva the Syrians are</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="4.889">free to come up with whatever kind of</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="4.92">system they want it&amp;#39;s up to them to</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="5.69">decide he says but the United States</text>
  <text start="542.14" dur="6.24">says they can have Assad as their leader</text>
  <text start="545.339" dur="5.62">so how is that leaving it up to the</text>
  <text start="548.38" dur="5.91">Syrian people if the Syrian people say</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="5.461">we want a son as our leader well the</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="6.18">people have spoken but Washington will</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="8.09">not agree to that so as long as the</text>
  <text start="560.47" dur="5.13">Syrian people do what Washington says</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="4.12">they</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="5.489">can have freedom and they can have their</text>
  <text start="568.63" dur="5.61">country as a whole if they don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="571.089" dur="7.05">to what washington is saying well then</text>
  <text start="574.24" dur="7.44">all bets are off so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="578.139" dur="7.231">here is that and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="6.54">saying this they don&amp;#39;t care what the</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="8.279">people say they don&amp;#39;t care about freedom</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="8.46">democracy because they want it a certain</text>
  <text start="593.649" dur="6.331">way when I say they it&amp;#39;s Washington it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="6.51">the central bankers they want this their</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="6.18">way and if the people do not agree guess</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="5.25">what we don&amp;#39;t care what you say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.76">going to do it anyway it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="608.44" dur="6.06">thing here in the United States up to a</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="5.7">point they&amp;#39;ll allow the people to speak</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="4.47">out but if the people go in one</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="3.36">direction and they wanted to go in a</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="6.03">different direction they don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="7.32">the people say this is dictatorship this</text>
  <text start="625" dur="6.149">is not an open free democracy now it</text>
  <text start="628.3" dur="5.31">seems that the peace talks are starting</text>
  <text start="631.149" dur="5.43">to break down because they&amp;#39;ve come up to</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="10.469">a point where they&amp;#39;re trying to talk</text>
  <text start="636.579" dur="11.07">about Assange future and there is no</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="6.901">area in the peace talks that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.649" dur="6.571">supposed to talk about Assad it&amp;#39;s not up</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="5.64">for negotiation but the opposition and</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="4.32">the United States government the central</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="5.069">bankers they want this brought up</text>
  <text start="658.54" dur="4.919">because this is all they want they want</text>
  <text start="661.689" dur="4.231">to talk about what&amp;#39;s going to happen to</text>
  <text start="663.459" dur="5.55">Assad now remember it&amp;#39;s going to be left</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="5.519">up to the people the people are going to</text>
  <text start="669.009" dur="5.281">have an election the people are going to</text>
  <text start="671.439" dur="4.32">decide and we can see already that the</text>
  <text start="674.29" dur="5.63">United States is very nervous about this</text>
  <text start="675.759" dur="6.57">because with Russia&amp;#39;s help Assad has</text>
  <text start="679.92" dur="4.39">gotten rid of a lot of the terrorist</text>
  <text start="682.329" dur="3.721">threat they&amp;#39;re liberating a lot of towns</text>
  <text start="684.31" dur="4.23">a lot of villages a lot of cities and</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="4.08">the people are going to vote for Assad</text>
  <text start="688.54" dur="4.399">now of course we know the United States</text>
  <text start="690.13" dur="6.209">is going to try to fix the elections and</text>
  <text start="692.939" dur="4.721">they&amp;#39;re in the process of doing this but</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="2.641">they&amp;#39;re very worried about the outcome</text>
  <text start="697.66" dur="5.1">of this</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="6.419">and we see right now that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="6.8">government they&amp;#39;re saying that there is</text>
  <text start="705.399" dur="7.951">a lack of progress in the ongoing Syrian</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="7.99">talks because they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="713.35" dur="8.22">responses from the opposition they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.55" dur="6.08">kind of stalling on all of this now very</text>
  <text start="721.57" dur="5.759">interestingly we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="7.149">violations in the ceasefire where the</text>
  <text start="727.329" dur="7.591">Free Syrian Army is violating the</text>
  <text start="730.779" dur="6.451">ceasefire and Russia has called for an</text>
  <text start="734.92" dur="4.919">emergency meeting and the US has</text>
  <text start="737.23" dur="4.68">rejected Russia&amp;#39;s call for an emergency</text>
  <text start="739.839" dur="5.911">meeting over the ceasefire violations in</text>
  <text start="741.91" dur="6.21">Syria now why did they do that well they</text>
  <text start="745.75" dur="5.07">really don&amp;#39;t want to discuss what the</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="5.1">Free Syrian Army is doing remember the</text>
  <text start="750.82" dur="4.61">Islamic state is being morphed into the</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="4.71">Free Syrian Army and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="755.43" dur="4.36">fighting in this area so they have the</text>
  <text start="757.93" dur="4.019">Islamic state which is still fighting</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="4.229">and they have them morph into the Free</text>
  <text start="761.949" dur="4.591">Syrian Army where you&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="764.019" dur="5.521">you can&amp;#39;t fire upon us so it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="766.54" dur="5.7">very very confusing who&amp;#39;s on which side</text>
  <text start="769.54" dur="4.56">right now because the US realizes they</text>
  <text start="772.24" dur="4.26">can use this to their advantage but at</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="7.44">this point we see that Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="8.1">they are continually pushing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="781.54" dur="4.849">state further and further back there</text>
  <text start="784.6" dur="5.039">liberating all these towns and villages</text>
  <text start="786.389" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;ve taken over the oil fields taken</text>
  <text start="789.639" dur="5.911">over the refineries and the whole</text>
  <text start="792.459" dur="4.68">situation is not going well for the</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="3.979">proxy army for the United States and</text>
  <text start="797.139" dur="5.94">this is why we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="799.529" dur="6.55">that Turkey and the United States are</text>
  <text start="803.079" dur="6.24">working together to come up with a new</text>
  <text start="806.079" dur="5.731">plan we see it&amp;#39;s already in motion where</text>
  <text start="809.319" dur="5.221">turkey is getting hit with a lot of</text>
  <text start="811.81" dur="5.13">false flags we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="814.54" dur="5.159">it on the Kurds they&amp;#39;re blaming it on</text>
  <text start="816.94" dur="5.06">the Islamic state trying to link the two</text>
  <text start="819.699" dur="8.791">trying to say it&amp;#39;s all coming from Syria</text>
  <text start="822" dur="10.62">we see out in Syria Turkish investors</text>
  <text start="828.49" dur="6.95">are coming in and buying up a lot</text>
  <text start="832.62" dur="5.91">of the land on the syrian-turkish border</text>
  <text start="835.44" dur="5.79">from the Syrian people they&amp;#39;re buying up</text>
  <text start="838.53" dur="5.88">homes estates for pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="5.49">and most likely this is to set up a safe</text>
  <text start="844.41" dur="4.17">zone to say listen we own this land</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re taking it over we&amp;#39;re setting up a</text>
  <text start="848.58" dur="3.57">safe zone and their plans are still in</text>
  <text start="851.01" dur="5.25">motion they&amp;#39;re just trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="852.15" dur="5.55">a way to push this forward and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="856.26" dur="4.08">not going to stop so we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="5.55">a lot more false flags occur in this</text>
  <text start="860.34" dur="5.88">area we&amp;#39;re going to see the false flags</text>
  <text start="863.25" dur="6.3">spread throughout Europe because they</text>
  <text start="866.22" dur="6.9">really need to build this up because</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="5.94">they can&amp;#39;t allow the peace talks to go</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="6.42">further they can&amp;#39;t allow Assad to stay</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="8.73">in power because remember the economy at</text>
  <text start="879.54" dur="8.85">this point is still collapsing they</text>
  <text start="884.22" dur="5.7">still need a war to cover this up and of</text>
  <text start="888.39" dur="3.66">course yes they do believe if they can</text>
  <text start="889.92" dur="3.54">get into Syria then get into Iran they</text>
  <text start="892.05" dur="3.9">can prop this up for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="893.46" dur="4.23">and if all else fails they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="895.95" dur="4.23">start war now every time they try to</text>
  <text start="897.69" dur="6.36">push war putin&amp;#39;s on the other end trying</text>
  <text start="900.18" dur="6.42">to push peace because if Putin really</text>
  <text start="904.05" dur="4.53">wanted more there were so many chances</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="4.53">up to this point that war could have</text>
  <text start="908.58" dur="6.08">been started right off the bat but we</text>
  <text start="911.13" dur="8.52">see right now that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="914.66" dur="10.08">rumbling out there that countries are</text>
  <text start="919.65" dur="8.37">preparing for attacks by the terrorists</text>
  <text start="924.74" dur="4.96">now what&amp;#39;s really happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="928.02" dur="2.97">letting everyone know there a lot of</text>
  <text start="929.7" dur="4.14">false flags that are going to be</text>
  <text start="930.99" dur="4.41">happening we see that Special Forces and</text>
  <text start="933.84" dur="4.74">other law enforcement agency in London</text>
  <text start="935.4" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re preparing for terror attacks and</text>
  <text start="938.58" dur="8.46">they&amp;#39;re saying maybe as many as 10 at</text>
  <text start="942.51" dur="6.99">once remember a long time ago and I</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="5.69">mentioned this met in many reports that</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="6.78">the next false flag that the main one is</text>
  <text start="952.73" dur="5.86">going to be a multi-prong type of an</text>
  <text start="956.28" dur="4.89">event it&amp;#39;s not going to be a single lone</text>
  <text start="958.59" dur="5.179">shooter it&amp;#39;s going to be large it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="4.13">going to happen in many different areas</text>
  <text start="963.769" dur="3.54">and we could see at this point this is</text>
  <text start="965.3" dur="4.05">what they&amp;#39;re building up to and we can</text>
  <text start="967.309" dur="5.07">see out in London they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="969.35" dur="6.469">there we see in Paris they had the</text>
  <text start="972.379" dur="6.541">largest chemical biological drill and</text>
  <text start="975.819" dur="5.8">out in London we see that officials have</text>
  <text start="978.92" dur="7.169">also prepared for a potential chemical</text>
  <text start="981.619" dur="7.65">or biological weapons attack now they</text>
  <text start="986.089" dur="5.85">need something large to convince the</text>
  <text start="989.269" dur="4.44">people this is why they need to go after</text>
  <text start="991.939" dur="4.89">the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re still using</text>
  <text start="993.709" dur="5.73">the story that the Islamic state is the</text>
  <text start="996.829" dur="4.86">bad guy because most of the world still</text>
  <text start="999.439" dur="4.2">believes this yes there are a few that</text>
  <text start="1001.689" dur="3.74">know that this is the proxy army of the</text>
  <text start="1003.639" dur="5.461">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1005.429" dur="6.76">but they&amp;#39;re going to do a huge multi</text>
  <text start="1009.1" dur="4.799">prong type of an event and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1012.189" dur="3.33">this before it&amp;#39;s going to consist of</text>
  <text start="1013.899" dur="4.17">physical attacks most likely from the</text>
  <text start="1015.519" dur="4.5">Islamic state and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="1018.069" dur="3.3">okay they hit us with chemical</text>
  <text start="1020.019" dur="3.51">biological it&amp;#39;s going to happen in</text>
  <text start="1021.369" dur="3.54">multiple cities probably in the UK</text>
  <text start="1023.529" dur="3.481">throughout Europe and the United States</text>
  <text start="1024.909" dur="4.17">and then they&amp;#39;re going to probably most</text>
  <text start="1027.01" dur="5.519">likely follow this up with some type of</text>
  <text start="1029.079" dur="6.931">cyber attack from Russia or China or</text>
  <text start="1032.529" dur="6.42">North Korea to show that while the US</text>
  <text start="1036.01" dur="4.86">was busy dealing or UK or europe they</text>
  <text start="1038.949" dur="4.47">were all of us were busy dealing with</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="6.029">these physical attacks they came in and</text>
  <text start="1043.419" dur="6.291">hit the financial sector and this would</text>
  <text start="1046.899" dur="5.431">be a way of explaining how the economy</text>
  <text start="1049.71" dur="5.65">completely fell apart and it would give</text>
  <text start="1052.33" dur="4.829">them the excuse to shut down everything</text>
  <text start="1055.36" dur="4.02">to put the bank&amp;#39;s on a bank holiday and</text>
  <text start="1057.159" dur="3.781">to close everything down where you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1059.38" dur="5.07">take any of your funds out of the bank</text>
  <text start="1060.94" dur="5.369">and we can see at this point this is</text>
  <text start="1064.45" dur="5.15">where they are headed at this time and</text>
  <text start="1066.309" dur="8.071">you know once everything gets shut down</text>
  <text start="1069.6" dur="6.579">once they do this they will then</text>
  <text start="1074.38" dur="4.62">implement the bail and documents and</text>
  <text start="1076.179" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;ll say okay a lot of the money has</text>
  <text start="1079" dur="3.36">been siphoned off we don&amp;#39;t know where it</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="4.71">went we got hit with the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1082.36" dur="5.279">the Fed will have to step in start</text>
  <text start="1085.21" dur="4.23">hitting us with QE for five or six</text>
  <text start="1087.639" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;ll start printing money like crazy</text>
  <text start="1089.44" dur="8.13">all eyes will be on going to war with</text>
  <text start="1092.83" dur="6.83">all of these different foes and we</text>
  <text start="1097.57" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ll have World War three at this point</text>
  <text start="1099.66" dur="6.97">now will it happen exactly in this order</text>
  <text start="1102.61" dur="6.84">most likely not but this is the type of</text>
  <text start="1106.63" dur="5.01">scenario that we are looking at at this</text>
  <text start="1109.45" dur="4.64">point because their backs are against</text>
  <text start="1111.64" dur="4.62">the wall they don&amp;#39;t know what else to do</text>
  <text start="1114.09" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re coming up with all different</text>
  <text start="1116.26" dur="7.59">plans and the economy is accelerating</text>
  <text start="1120.46" dur="5.22">and it&amp;#39;s collapsing doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="1123.85" dur="4.44">the markets doing doesn&amp;#39;t matter how</text>
  <text start="1125.68" dur="4.8">much they suppress gold and silver the</text>
  <text start="1128.29" dur="3.6">real economic indicators are completely</text>
  <text start="1130.48" dur="4.77">falling apart and there will come a</text>
  <text start="1131.89" dur="5.1">point in time where the reality is is</text>
  <text start="1135.25" dur="4.77">that the economies have come to a</text>
  <text start="1136.99" dur="5.55">screeching halt and it will look kind of</text>
  <text start="1140.02" dur="4.29">ridiculous that more and more people are</text>
  <text start="1142.54" dur="5.7">getting laid off companies are laying</text>
  <text start="1144.31" dur="5.43">off everyone is standing here going okay</text>
  <text start="1148.24" dur="2.78">something is really wrong because we</text>
  <text start="1149.74" dur="3.72">already see it with consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="1151.02" dur="5.13">that people throughout Europe the United</text>
