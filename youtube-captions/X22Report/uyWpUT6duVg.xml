  <text start="133.1" dur="4.98">lot of people believe that this is not</text>
  <text start="136.43" dur="4.44">happening a lot of people think that</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="5.61">everything is great and everyone thought</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="4.17">the same exact thing prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="3.18">everyone was like what are you talking</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="3.39">about I&amp;#39;m buying another house I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="3.48">taking out another loan I&amp;#39;m buying</text>
  <text start="148.43" dur="3.75">another car everything is fantastic I</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="4.85">don&amp;#39;t feel like anything is wrong</text>
  <text start="152.18" dur="4.919">actually when Obama became running</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="4.36">McCain was that they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="157.099" dur="3.36">economy was incredibly strong everything</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="3.8">was great</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="5.671">there are no problems whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="163.36" dur="5.23">once again we know that turned out to be</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.59">alive we know that the head of the Fed</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="3.99">at the time Bernanke he was out there</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="4.23">saying that we&amp;#39;re not forecasting any</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="5.4">type of recession in the same year the</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="5.7">market came down so we know that these</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="6.119">people lie we know that they never tell</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="6.6">the truth and this is why we look at the</text>
  <text start="184.099" dur="5.131">data this is why we look at what</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="4.98">really going on not what the government</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="5.27">is feeding us not what the stock market</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="6.42">is doing not what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="6.88">tells us we look at other information</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="4.59">now we&amp;#39;re looking at housing right now</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="5.22">and we know that Case Shiller they look</text>
  <text start="203.24" dur="5.67">at 20 cities and from these 20 cities</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.46">they tell us how the housing market is</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="7.11">doing and according to the latest BLS</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="7.89">BLS data the average hourly wages for</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="6.21">all US workers in November rose around</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="5.7">2.5 percent relative to the previous</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="7.74">year well below the feds target of 3.5</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="6.42">to 4.5% now this is kind of weird</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="4.68">because the unemployment number is at</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="4.79">4.1 percent and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s no slack in the economy and</text>
  <text start="236.86" dur="4.24">since there&amp;#39;s no slack in the economy it</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.059">fails to boost wage growth and this is</text>
  <text start="241.1" dur="3.02">something where they&amp;#39;re looking at it</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="6.121">saying this doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="6.67">now what we are seeing here is that the</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="6">housing market the prices of homes</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re going up so quickly that wages</text>
  <text start="254.36" dur="7.17">are not keeping up whatsoever which</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="6.42">means the everyday person is being left</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="4.44">behind they can&amp;#39;t afford these homes now</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="5.19">remember they&amp;#39;re pushing the bubbles up</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="4.56">in these 20 cities this is being done on</text>
  <text start="269" dur="3.78">purpose to make it look like everything</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="4.74">is great and they&amp;#39;re doing in the</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re doing this in Seattle Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="4.44">San Francisco San Diego tamper Denver</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="5.79">Detroit Dallas Los Angeles New York</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="6.63">Phoenix Atlanta Miami you know all the</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="4.62">cities and they use these cities to say</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="6.69">look how great everything is</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="9.81">and of course right now we are just 1%</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="7.29">of the record highs from 2006 remember</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="5.43">when everyone said oh good times they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="4.83">gonna last forever and we&amp;#39;re in 2006 and</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="4.59">it was the height of the housing market</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="5.76">and people were renting them out taking</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="7.47">out extra loans well the prices of homes</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="6.629">right now they&amp;#39;re 1% shy of the top here</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="4.5">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="317.539" dur="3.421">this in all these different cities that</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re telling us you know</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="3.87">look at the housing prices because when</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="3.6">people hear housing prices they think</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="3.57">wow the economy must be doing well</text>
  <text start="326.69" dur="4.02">people feel great</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="4.35">I have equity in my home I feel like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="3.179">making money but it&amp;#39;s only on paper you</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t make anything until you sell a</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="4.081">home yes you can take an equity line of</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="4.5">credit out on your house but again</text>
  <text start="337.97" dur="7.02">that&amp;#39;s debt you have to pay that back</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="6.089">and when we look at each city for each</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="3.51">individual in these cities if they</text>
  <text start="346.639" dur="4.471">wanted to buy a house they would need an</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="3.96">increase in their wages for example like</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="2.58">Los Angeles they need one hundred and</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="3.269">twenty two percent increase in their</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="5.31">wages San Francisco one hundred and</text>
  <text start="355.729" dur="6.391">seven percent New York 95 percent Boston</text>
  <text start="359" dur="4.139">eighty one percent and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="362.12" dur="4.53">throughout these cities right now the</text>
  <text start="363.139" dur="5.491">national average is six percent there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="3.96">no way that these people can purchase</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="5.779">these homes it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="7.23">now let&amp;#39;s add on to that that the</text>
  <text start="374.409" dur="6.66">30-year fixed mortgage rate it is</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="7.53">increasing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s surging right now</text>
  <text start="381.069" dur="6.581">so what does that mean well this is</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="4.919">coming from mortgage news daily the</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="5.37">mortgage rates surged to highest levels</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="5.31">in more than three years which means</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s going to take those people who are</text>
  <text start="395.599" dur="4.5">looking for a house it&amp;#39;s gonna take them</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="5.639">out of the market which is another</text>
  <text start="400.099" dur="5.641">problem we saw this happen during 2006</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="5.161">2007 when they were raising the rates</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="4.44">very very quickly it pushed everyone out</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="3.81">of the market and those people had</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="3.87">adjustable rate mortgage as well they</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="3.029">were screwed and they just left their</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="2.85">homes because they knew whatever they</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="4.56">fixed whatever they locked into in the</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="4.44">fixed rate they couldn&amp;#39;t pay it so they</text>
  <text start="419.719" dur="5.79">knew they were they couldn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="5.31">and we see right now the Fed yes is</text>
  <text start="425.509" dur="3.69">raising the rates but they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="4.71">very very slowly but the mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="429.199" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re moving very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re surging at this point so we see</text>
  <text start="434.659" dur="4.651">right now that we have many things</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="5.33">happening all at once and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.06">going to see is we&amp;#39;re going to see other</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="5.38">indicators and we&amp;#39;re gonna see them</text>
  <text start="444.37" dur="5.469">we&amp;#39;re gonna look at them and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="6.81">see that the economy is ripping itself</text>
  <text start="449.839" dur="5.25">apart actually online sales didn&amp;#39;t do as</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="2.879">well</text>
  <text start="455.089" dur="4.29">economists thought they were going to do</text>
  <text start="456.679" dur="3.6">they were well below expectations they</text>
  <text start="459.379" dur="2.85">thought they were gonna get like</text>
  <text start="460.279" dur="3.66">something like a 14 or 15 percent</text>
  <text start="462.229" dur="4.65">increase they got like 11 point</text>
  <text start="463.939" dur="6.69">something percent increase in online</text>
  <text start="466.879" dur="7.35">sales and once again it wasn&amp;#39;t as great</text>
  <text start="470.629" dur="6.08">as they thought and again online sales</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="4.5">it only makes up a small fraction of</text>
  <text start="476.709" dur="4.09">retail and we see a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="3.27">closing right now a lot of stores saying</text>
  <text start="480.799" dur="3.45">that they won&amp;#39;t be able to make it and</text>
  <text start="481.999" dur="7.111">we know that their debt comes due very</text>
  <text start="484.249" dur="6.99">very soon we also see that the crypto</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="5.159">market they&amp;#39;re having their ups and</text>
  <text start="491.239" dur="4.83">downs and we know the central banks</text>
  <text start="494.269" dur="3.81">around the world they want control of</text>
  <text start="496.069" dur="4.59">the crypto market they don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="498.079" dur="5.85">crypto market they don&amp;#39;t like a free</text>
  <text start="500.659" dur="6.18">system that they can&amp;#39;t control they like</text>

  <text start="876.5" dur="5.19">right now is to have the system come</text>

  <text start="891.32" dur="6.12">most likely would not help but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="6.66">pretty obvious they also could nudge it</text>
  <text start="897.44" dur="5.1">and have people you know believe that</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="6.75">the dollar is weakening which they have</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="6.66">done this would be a problem they could</text>
  <text start="907.16" dur="4.65">also say which they&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="909.2" dur="6.06">throughout this year that the economy</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="5.19">has been accelerating at such a fast</text>
  <text start="915.26" dur="3.06">pace but the stock market&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="917" dur="3.57">because that&amp;#39;s what theory that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="918.32" dur="5.13">they use as their gauge they could say</text>
  <text start="920.57" dur="8.24">that the Fed should now increase rates</text>
  <text start="923.45" dur="5.36">at a faster pace like they did back in</text>
  <text start="929.62" dur="8.47">2006-2007 now it&amp;#39;s very interesting to</text>
  <text start="932.84" dur="7.59">CNBC they are saying that the Fed will</text>
  <text start="938.09" dur="4.92">be forced to raise rates more rapidly</text>
  <text start="940.43" dur="6.78">than expected because of an accelerating</text>
  <text start="943.01" dur="6.36">economy which means as they raise rates</text>
  <text start="947.21" dur="4.32">and as the mortgage rates go up the</text>
  <text start="949.37" dur="6.87">automobile rates go up and everything</text>
  <text start="951.53" dur="7.41">else all goes together people will not</text>
  <text start="956.24" dur="5.96">be able to afford anything and as the</text>
  <text start="958.94" dur="5.37">dollar weakens we have major problems</text>
  <text start="962.2" dur="4.3">everything starts to fall apart very</text>
  <text start="964.31" dur="4.91">very quickly now Chris Hamilton he came</text>
  <text start="966.5" dur="5.19">out with another article showing</text>
  <text start="969.22" dur="5.23">something about personal savings rate</text>
  <text start="971.69" dur="4.98">and when you look at the personal</text>
  <text start="974.45" dur="5.28">savings rate and every time we had some</text>
  <text start="976.67" dur="6.12">type of crash either a depression or</text>
  <text start="979.73" dur="6.75">recession we see two things happening</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="5.7">here we see the personal savings rate at</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="4">the lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen it</text>
  <text start="988.49" dur="5.059">before if we go back to 2000</text>
  <text start="990.48" dur="4.779">2007 the personal savings rate was down</text>
  <text start="993.549" dur="3.81">by two point it was down around two</text>
  <text start="995.259" dur="4.38">point three percent right now in the</text>
  <text start="997.359" dur="6.33">fourth quarter of 2017 the savings rate</text>
  <text start="999.639" dur="7.26">was around 2.4 percent and every time</text>

  <text start="1016.619" dur="8.251">have a problem now if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="1019.769" dur="8.37">we see the household net worth as a</text>
  <text start="1024.87" dur="7.98">percent of dpi was around six hundred</text>
  <text start="1028.139" dur="6.45">and fifty percent during oh six at the</text>
  <text start="1032.85" dur="4.199">same time the savings rate was down</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="5.401">around two point three percent if we go</text>
  <text start="1037.049" dur="5.73">back to 2001 it was around six hundred</text>
  <text start="1039.99" dur="4.939">and eleven percent for the household net</text>
  <text start="1042.779" dur="5.55">worth and the savings rate was down</text>
  <text start="1044.929" dur="7.451">around three point five percent if we</text>
  <text start="1048.329" dur="6.181">fast-forward to 2017 and we&amp;#39;re in 2018</text>
  <text start="1052.38" dur="5.49">right now but the fourth quarter of 2017</text>
  <text start="1054.51" dur="6.029">the household net worth as a percentage</text>
  <text start="1057.87" dur="5.58">of dpi is at its highest point we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1069.74" dur="7.659">around two point four percent this</text>
  <text start="1072.84" dur="7.439">spread is huge and basically what this</text>
  <text start="1077.399" dur="5.37">means is this is just another indicator</text>
  <text start="1080.279" dur="4.981">letting us know that the economy is</text>
  <text start="1082.769" dur="5.04">about to come down I mean we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>

  <text start="1087.809" dur="5.85">patterns that we&amp;#39;ve seen before and no</text>
  <text start="1091.649" dur="5.25">one can say for sure what comes next</text>

  <text start="1096.899" dur="6.931">has been unequivocally bad for asset</text>
