  <text start="69.39" dur="6.54">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="8.189">can see that in retail in manufacturing</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="6.39">in housing with the credit impulse which</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="5.941">is turned negative with loan creation</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing so many indicators that the</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.55">economy is ripping itself apart I mean</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="4.619">we&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this as</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on the economy been</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="5.851">watching the slow deterioration of the</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="4.77">economy but now we&amp;#39;re at the point where</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="4.2">things have gone to the next level and</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="3.929">we&amp;#39;re going to be talked about we can be</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="4.41">talking about what Trump is about to do</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="4.681">and many people are taking this the</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="4.92">wrong way and I&amp;#39;ll explain why when we</text>
  <text start="110.58" dur="4.739">get to that section here but when we see</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.739">retail we see that it&amp;#39;s imploding on</text>
  <text start="115.319" dur="4.56">itself Sears in Canada well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.629" dur="3.811">warning that looks like they might not</text>
  <text start="119.879" dur="4.261">be able to make it in Canada they might</text>
  <text start="121.44" dur="5.239">be closing down maybe all their stores</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="5.399">are trying to sell a lot of them and</text>
  <text start="126.679" dur="5.351">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to continue</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="5.041">operating it&amp;#39;s completely impossible we</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="6.06">see Kellogg&amp;#39;s right now the breakfast</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="5.37">food giant well they&amp;#39;re laying off a lot</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="4.71">more people than than they originally</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="5.369">thought and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="5.1">is that the total number of layoffs is</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="4.591">going to be around 11,000 and in</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="3.69">February the cereal maker announced that</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="4.43">it was shifting its distribution model</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="4.83">and it was closing around 39</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="5.59">distribution centers in states all</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="5.97">across the country and these states were</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="4.83">Ohio Tennessee Texas North Carolina New</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.11">York and other states where they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="4.8">informed that yet you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="5.61">laid off and the average number of</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="5.849">employees in each one of these</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="5.879">facilities ranges anywhere from 250 to</text>
  <text start="175.409" dur="5.151">500 feet and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="6.03">things are getting a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="180.56" dur="4.57">everyone expected actually if we look at</text>
  <text start="184.019" dur="5.971">the small</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="7.29">this sector we see that things well they</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="6.69">are not going well at all according to</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="7.19">the Federal Reserve only 35% of small</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="6.89">businesses are profitable which means</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="8.2">65% but these small businesses are not</text>
  <text start="203.57" dur="7.3">profitable at all and we can see right</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="6.9">now they are on the verge of going</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="5.82">belly-up and we can see why there are</text>
  <text start="214.71" dur="3.99">many people still living with their</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="5.25">parents because they cannot find jobs</text>
  <text start="218.7" dur="5.67">think that retail imploding contracting</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re not hiring more people the</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="6.18">restaurant foodservice industry</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="6.67">traffic is drying up people are not</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="5.36">hiring like they used to we think major</text>
  <text start="233.55" dur="5.81">corporations distribution centers</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="7.21">manufacturers laying off people closing</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="5.5">centers this is why 40% of young</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="3.9">Americans that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re living with</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="5.94">their parents and by the way this is the</text>
  <text start="247.02" dur="7.98">highest percentage in 75 years this is</text>
  <text start="250.8" dur="6.84">the recovery people 66 percent of the</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.26">largest companies in the US that have</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="3.96">given estimates of their earnings for</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.16">the next quarter have issued negative</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="6.66">guidance right now what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="264.42" dur="7.49">is a complete disaster of the economy</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="9.3">let me put the retail store closures in</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="8.73">perspective they have skyrocketed by 286</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="3.08">percent this year</text>
  <text start="280.79" dur="6.61">286 percent so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="5.66">economy and we look at one end to the</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="6.09">other we see it&amp;#39;s ripping itself</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="4.69">completely apart and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="3.9">right now is we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="295.2" dur="5.46">inflation because the first time in</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="5.7">three years core producer prices they</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="6.12">have risen at a faster pace than they</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="7.17">feds mandated 2% target and we know this</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="6.48">2% target is completely manipulated it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="5.25">to serve the central bank&amp;#39;s agenda and</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="4.02">we know if we go to the supermarket if</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="2.99">we go to any other place we know that</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="3.47">the cost of food</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="4.02">products have continually moved up and</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.14">up and up a lot of the inflation is</text>
  <text start="322.52" dur="4.17">being forced into the stock market and a</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="4.23">lot of it&amp;#39;s being sent overseas so when</text>
  <text start="326.69" dur="4.38">all these dollars come back to the</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="4.98">United States we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="7.32">inflation and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="6.42">unbelievable when it hits now the latest</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="4.22">monthly fund manager survey from Bank of</text>
  <text start="340.52" dur="5.19">America well that&amp;#39;s out right now and</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="4.15">continuing the trend noted in previous</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="2.43">months when the number of active</text>
  <text start="346.76" dur="3.84">managers who said that stocks are</text>
  <text start="348.14" dur="5.25">overvalued hit the highest nearly in two</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="4.95">decades well the latest version reveals</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="4.71">the number of respondents saying that</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="5.07">the equities are overvalued well it just</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="6.92">hit a record high it surpassed the</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="6.93">all-time high set during 1999 bubble and</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="4.72">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that 44</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="5.04">percent of the fund managers now say</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="5.64">yeah equities they&amp;#39;re overvalued and</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="4.62">this is the highest response on record</text>
  <text start="375.38" dur="5.43">so what does this tell us</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.459">it tells us that the market makes no</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="3.93">sense of course it doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="3.601">completely manipulated they&amp;#39;re pushing a</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="3.39">button they&amp;#39;re pushing a mouse button</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="4.23">and they can make the market move up</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="4.08">they can market move down we have the</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="3.51">central bank&amp;#39;s buying up all these tech</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="5.519">stocks they buy a lot more to push the</text>
  <text start="394.01" dur="4.89">market back up there&amp;#39;s no reality in the</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="4.5">market right now</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="6.45">now countries financial institutions</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="4.981">they are starting to realize that the</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="4.92">system&amp;#39;s coming down actually Goldman</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="6.33">Sachs they&amp;#39;re starting to cover Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="6.78">we also see that Russia spoke to the</text>
  <text start="413.54" dur="6.09">developer of aetherium and this is a</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.22">blockchain technology where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="4.59">looking to use this to build</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="6.85">infrastructure and they might even use</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="7.11">this to build maybe a national virtual</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="6.27">currency as long as it&amp;#39;s not controlled</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="6.75">and it&amp;#39;s decentralized it&amp;#39;s a sound</text>
  <text start="434.39" dur="5.85">currency and will they back this with</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="3.99">anything we don&amp;#39;t know how will this</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="4.08">proceed we don&amp;#39;t know but we can see</text>
  <text start="442.07" dur="5.04">right now countries are starting to</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="4.77">realize there is value in crypto</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.17">currencies now I believe we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="3.39">very early stages of crypto currents I</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="3.39">believe this is almost like</text>
  <text start="452.48" dur="4.68">dot-com type of thing where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="4.47">lot of cryptocurrencies and eventually</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="3.18">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is a lot of these</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="4.8">cryptocurrencies are going to completely</text>
  <text start="460.34" dur="5.82">disappear and we will only have a few of</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="3.9">these left and I think aetherium is</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="4.08">going to be one of them this is like the</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="5.37">building blocks of cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.97">they can build a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="4.35">and use it for many different things so</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="4.32">I think this is going to be very</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="6.38">important moving forward now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.53" dur="5.55">talking about how the central bank is</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="4.87">pushing to bring the economy down and</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="6.75">how Trump is doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="8.1">and we see right now that Trump has laid</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="7.41">out his banking rules to overhaul the</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="5.64">banks which will remove a lot of the</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="3.66">regulations in the Volcker rule and a</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="3.15">lot of people are out there screaming</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="3.72">and yelling saying oh my god this is a</text>
  <text start="505.7" dur="2.73">terrible thing everything&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="3.24">crash</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.14">banks will run while they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="3.54">do whatever they want well let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="3.75">about this for a second we know the</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="3.69">central bank right now they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="4.26">down the economy we can see already with</text>
  <text start="518.09" dur="4.23">their interest rate hikes if again if</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="3.6">they raise the interest rates this week</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="4.17">it means they accelerated the process</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="4.56">they know what Trump is up to if you</text>
  <text start="526.49" dur="5.01">were going to bankrupt someone let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="4.68">take his position right now and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.65">forget about the government if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="5.16">going to bankrupt a household would you</text>
  <text start="536.15" dur="4.5">have regulations on the household how</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="4.35">much you can spend what you can invest</text>
  <text start="540.65" dur="5.04">and what you can do because we know for</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.01">a fact that this economy that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="4.92">and the housing that the household that</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s no way of fixing it too much</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="4.53">debt not enough tax receipts coming and</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="3.18">not enough income coming in there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="4.71">nothing we can do and we need to start</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="6.21">over so you know you have to crash the</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="6.84">system what do you do you let those</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="8.31">individuals spend as much as they</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="6.45">possibly can until they go bankrupt they</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="6.35">spend on the credit cards they keep</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="8.1">doing it he wants the banks to go crazy</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="5.8">he&amp;#39;s tricking them into thinking wow</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="3.84">look what he just did for us this is</text>
  <text start="583.28" dur="4.14">going to be incredible</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="5.7">actually he&amp;#39;s doing the opposite he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="4.77">telling everyone that he&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="3.15">easier for the banks to do all these</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="4.2">things because he wants them to go out</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="4.53">there and he wants them to destroy</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="5.97">themselves think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="598.46" dur="7.95">glass-steagall was in place since the</text>
  <text start="602.36" dur="8.55">30s and it was removed by I think was</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="7.17">Clinton that was in 99 and all of a</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="5.3">sudden the banks went crazy what did</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="7.59">they do they created subprime securities</text>
  <text start="616.21" dur="7.57">they commingled speculative investments</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="5.73">with depositors and no one was safe and</text>
  <text start="623.78" dur="5.25">what did it do it destroyed the banks</text>
  <text start="626.9" dur="4.17">but of course the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="629.03" dur="5.19">bank stepped in and said no no we need</text>
  <text start="631.07" dur="5.76">to save these banking systems we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="634.22" dur="4.74">let them go they&amp;#39;re too big to fail this</text>
  <text start="636.83" dur="6.03">time it&amp;#39;s a little he&amp;#39;s removing all</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="6.39">this to have the system go down now of</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="5.22">course the Treasury secretary he&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="4.59">on board with this again Trump is using</text>
  <text start="648.08" dur="4.11">him I know a lot of people think always</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="5.16">part of goldman sachs of course he is he</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="6.36">needs him in there to use him just like</text>
  <text start="655.1" dur="6.66">he needed Saudi Arabia with the covert</text>
  <text start="658.55" dur="6.09">story of arms selling to them he needed</text>
  <text start="661.76" dur="4.02">as a cover story he&amp;#39;s playing with all</text>
  <text start="664.64" dur="3.59">these people and I&amp;#39;m going to show you</text>
  <text start="665.78" dur="6.3">how he is playing with the central bank</text>
  <text start="668.23" dur="6.37">there is a battle right now on who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="6.48">going to bring down the economy first</text>
  <text start="674.6" dur="6.81">and Trump needs to gain the narrative</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="5.07">the central bank wants the narrative and</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="5.34">they want to point the finger at each</text>
  <text start="683.63" dur="4.29">other so according to The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="686.75" dur="3.42">Journal we&amp;#39;re going to take the Wall</text>
  <text start="687.92" dur="3.6">Street Journal as reporting the truth I</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="3.57">know that&amp;#39;s very hard to do it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="4.14">difficult to do but they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="4.86">there was a meeting with said chairman</text>
  <text start="695.66" dur="6.09">Janet Yellen in the Oval Office and he</text>
  <text start="698.6" dur="5.76">was in there with Cohen and they were</text>
  <text start="701.75" dur="6.33">talking and the president said to Yellen</text>
  <text start="704.36" dur="6.45">he considered her like himself a low</text>
  <text start="708.08" dur="6.21">interest rate person now the question is</text>
  <text start="710.81" dur="5.85">why would he say that to her because he</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="4.62">knows that they&amp;#39;ve been raising the</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="5.28">rates they started raising it</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="5.73">before he was actually inaugurated they</text>
  <text start="721.94" dur="5.55">raised it while he was president and</text>
  <text start="724.64" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re looking to raise the rates once</text>
  <text start="727.49" dur="5.52">again</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="8.61">now why would he say that like you like</text>
  <text start="733.01" dur="6.39">him he&amp;#39;s a low interest rate person he</text>
  <text start="736.73" dur="4.83">wants the central bank to do the</text>
  <text start="739.4" dur="5.13">opposite of what he&amp;#39;s saying and they</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="5.22">will do the opposite because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="744.53" dur="7.38">want to go along with what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="746.78" dur="7.8">he wants them to raise the rates because</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="6.62">he knows this will start bringing down</text>
  <text start="754.58" dur="7.29">the system he&amp;#39;s setting all of this up</text>
  <text start="758.53" dur="6.49">he&amp;#39;s using reverse psychology he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="5.31">pushing the banks to go out and blow</text>
  <text start="765.02" dur="6.36">these bubbles up to destroy themselves</text>
  <text start="767.18" dur="8.25">and when it does happen the system goes</text>
  <text start="771.38" dur="7.14">down he wants the system to go down just</text>
  <text start="775.43" dur="5.16">like in a household if someone is not</text>
  <text start="778.52" dur="4.14">bringing in the income or maybe loses</text>
  <text start="780.59" dur="4.74">their job and gets a part-time job they</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="5.37">have this huge amount of debt you just</text>
  <text start="785.33" dur="6.39">keep spending until you go bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="788.03" dur="7.62">then you start over the economy cannot</text>
  <text start="791.72" dur="6.66">be fixed right now the economy is dead</text>
  <text start="795.65" dur="5.64">the central bank the deep state the</text>
  <text start="798.38" dur="6.6">criminal empire they have destroyed the</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="5.61">system it&amp;#39;s non operational everything</text>
  <text start="804.98" dur="3.93">that he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="4.47">talking about manufacturing bringing</text>
  <text start="808.91" dur="5.52">jobs back this is for after the fact</text>
  <text start="811.37" dur="4.65">first he has to clean house and get rid</text>
  <text start="814.43" dur="3.66">of what we&amp;#39;re in right now there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="816.02" dur="4.32">to be a transition period I&amp;#39;m sure he</text>
  <text start="818.09" dur="5.82">already has plans laid out on how this</text>
  <text start="820.34" dur="7.56">is going to work out and we see right</text>
  <text start="823.91" dur="7.17">now that in order to do all of this he</text>
  <text start="827.9" dur="5.37">needs them to bring the system down he</text>
  <text start="831.08" dur="5.46">needs to help them bring the system and</text>
  <text start="833.27" dur="5.79">once the system falls apart then and</text>
  <text start="836.54" dur="6.15">only then Kenney reinstate</text>
  <text start="839.06" dur="6.63">glass-steagall he can then take control</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="5.1">of the system maybe back it by gold</text>
  <text start="845.69" dur="5.22">maybe use a virtual currency a</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="4.89">cryptocurrency we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="850.91" dur="4.229">but we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="852.68" dur="5.219">this transition period and this</text>
  <text start="855.139" dur="5.64">transition period well it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="857.899" dur="6.24">a little tough and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="860.779" dur="6.42">period of time where everything that we</text>
  <text start="864.139" dur="4.95">know is going to change that currency</text>
  <text start="867.199" dur="5.19">that you know that&amp;#39;s in the bank your</text>
  <text start="869.089" dur="6.93">pensions all these things well if the</text>
  <text start="872.389" dur="5.31">system goes down they disappear I mean</text>
  <text start="876.019" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ll use balance they&amp;#39;ll try to save</text>
  <text start="877.699" dur="3.661">themselves the banking system will do</text>
  <text start="879.529" dur="4.5">whatever they possibly can the central</text>
  <text start="881.36" dur="5.61">bank will create currency like crazy but</text>
  <text start="884.029" dur="5.49">it will go nowhere because the system is</text>
  <text start="886.97" dur="6.869">going to die there will be no bailout</text>
  <text start="889.519" dur="6.63">and he wants it to die it has to die the</text>
  <text start="893.839" dur="5.22">system cannot continue to operate like</text>
  <text start="896.149" dur="4.951">this it was going to crash one way or</text>
  <text start="899.059" dur="5.611">another and if they kept it going on</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="6.029">even longer did we know middle class the</text>
  <text start="904.67" dur="5.009">middle class would be poor more wealth</text>
  <text start="907.129" dur="5.43">would be shifted to the 1% even the</text>
  <text start="909.679" dur="4.53">upper wealthy class would start moving</text>
  <text start="912.559" dur="3.84">down in ranks and finding it more and</text>
  <text start="914.209" dur="5.19">more difficult and eventually what would</text>
  <text start="916.399" dur="6.24">happen is you would have a to system</text>
  <text start="919.399" dur="6.87">type of thing the 1% and the rest and we</text>
  <text start="922.639" dur="7.531">see already that they&amp;#39;ve tried to cover</text>
  <text start="926.269" dur="6.87">up everything they tried to prepare over</text>
  <text start="930.17" dur="4.2">the years for the coming crash they</text>
  <text start="933.139" dur="3.091">thought they&amp;#39;d have the narrative I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="3.569">talking about the central bank talking</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="4.169">about the criminal empire the deep state</text>
  <text start="937.939" dur="4.531">and what they&amp;#39;re realizing is that</text>
  <text start="940.399" dur="4.05">everything around them is starting to</text>
  <text start="942.47" dur="4.469">fall apart and there&amp;#39;s nothing they can</text>
  <text start="944.449" dur="4.98">do and it looks like he&amp;#39;s taking the</text>
  <text start="946.939" dur="5.07">upper hand right now and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.429" dur="5.4">controlling the situation he will be</text>
  <text start="952.009" dur="5.7">controlling what happens from this point</text>
  <text start="954.829" dur="5.88">on and you could see he&amp;#39;s still pushing</text>
  <text start="957.709" dur="4.651">out their fake news because this is all</text>
  <text start="960.709" dur="3.331">part of the strategy now that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
