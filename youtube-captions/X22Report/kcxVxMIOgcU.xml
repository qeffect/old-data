  <text start="60.23" dur="6.48">and today&amp;#39;s date is August 29th 2017 and</text>
  <text start="64.369" dur="4.11">the thought of the episode is the ugly</text>
  <text start="66.71" dur="4.53">truth of the economic disaster that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="68.479" dur="5.551">headed our way let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.24" dur="5.879">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="74.03" dur="6.39">are watching the global economy</text>
  <text start="77.119" dur="5.28">deteriorate very very quickly and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="80.42" dur="4.77">getting more and more indicators that</text>
  <text start="82.399" dur="4.86">are showing that this is definitely</text>
  <text start="85.19" dur="4.05">happening now we&amp;#39;ve been following many</text>
  <text start="87.259" dur="3.241">many different indicators and some of</text>
  <text start="89.24" dur="3.39">them are already showing us in a</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="5.28">recession some are saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.63" dur="5.129">entering into a depression and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="95.78" dur="4.589">been watching retail well that has been</text>
  <text start="97.759" dur="5.551">imploding like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow we</text>
  <text start="100.369" dur="5.61">also see out in the eurozone out in the</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="4.589">UK that things are not going well right</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="4.89">now consumer spending growth in the</text>
  <text start="107.899" dur="5.521">eurozone well it&amp;#39;s likely to slow this</text>
  <text start="110.869" dur="4.231">year even though they&amp;#39;re saying there is</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="3.839">improvements of consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="115.1" dur="4.379">where people are saying that things feel</text>
  <text start="117.259" dur="5.31">better but what&amp;#39;s really happening right</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="6.51">now is that households real income</text>
  <text start="122.569" dur="5.97">growth well it has slowed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.989" dur="4.86">seeing higher inflation and the wages</text>
  <text start="128.539" dur="4.831">are declining and when you put these</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="5.61">things together what happens people</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t spend their money and this is</text>
  <text start="136.459" dur="5.131">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="4.38">remember the central bank&amp;#39;s they want</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="3.899">people to spend they want people to go</text>
  <text start="143.66" dur="3.84">into their pockets go into their savings</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="4.171">account and they want them to go spend</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="5.129">this money they also want you to go into</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="5.7">your home equity take that money out</text>
  <text start="152.629" dur="4.981">borrow it and go spend in the economy</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="4.05">because their biggest problem is is</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="3.66">getting people to spend their money they</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t get people to do this and this is</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="4.98">a huge huge problem now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="4.14">interesting is that Best Buy came out</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="5.31">and said that they had strong sales and</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="4.83">we need to remember something that many</text>
  <text start="171.56" dur="4.83">people aren&amp;#39;t realizing that there are</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="4.89">many different stores that are closing</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="3.9">right now I mean one of them is HH Greg</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="4.65">that went bankrupt and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.29" dur="4.47">saying is that this is really not normal</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="3.66">because what is happening is their</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="3.6">competitors are closing down</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="5.01">which means people are then going over</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="4.89">to Best Buy to make a purchase and what</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is moving forward</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="4.2">that these strong sales that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="4.38">seeing right now well it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.5">be the new normal because once again as</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="4.77">these companies go out of business as</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="4.41">more people lose their job that traffic</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.08">is also going to dry up because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="4.62">seeing it happen all over the place we</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="4.5">see that many many people are not</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.83">purchasing homes right now now if we</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="5.52">take a quick look at the US housing</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing that it&amp;#39;s slowing wages are</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="4.83">only growing by two point five percent</text>
  <text start="220.22" dur="6.15">houses are increasing their prices are</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="5.49">growing by five percent and what is</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="5.91">happening here is that people can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="5.58">up with the inflation in the housing</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="5.67">market because their income is not</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="6.75">keeping up with inflation now if we look</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="5.25">at the data we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="3.33">different cities that are easier to</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="3.21">purchase a house and there are different</text>
  <text start="244.58" dur="4.02">cities that it&amp;#39;s much more difficult and</text>
  <text start="246.41" dur="3.57">when we look at this we can see the</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="3.96">difference here now when we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="4.2">at this chart that I have on the x-22</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="4.429">report here on youtube you can see the</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.809">chart if we look at Seattle for instance</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="6.611">well this chart shows how much household</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="5.941">income increase is needed to buy the</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="6.3">median priced home in the u.s. cities so</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="7.2">if we look at Seattle we&amp;#39;re looking at a</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="7.29">number of about 14% or so very close to</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="6.12">14% if we look at Portland we are</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="5.85">looking at 8% if we look at Dallas we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="5.94">looking at 8% Las Vegas we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="283.04" dur="5.58">8% Miami we&amp;#39;re looking at four and a</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="4.2">half percent so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="4.109">that these individuals well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.39" dur="4.2">gonna need a lot more money their wages</text>
  <text start="292.729" dur="4.201">are gonna have to go up to purchase a</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="3.63">home in these areas and there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="2.88">these different cities that are listed</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="4.8">and it&amp;#39;s becoming very very difficult</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="5.37">for people to basically afford a home</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="5.399">today this is why we see the housing</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.94">market well it&amp;#39;s in trouble it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="308.419" dur="4.741">doing well we see that foreign buyers</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="6.33">they are pulling back especially from</text>
  <text start="313.16" dur="7.08">China and we can see that the everyday</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="5.399">American they&amp;#39;re not purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="4.23">and in many different cities and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="322.849" dur="3.991">talking about the case-shiller 20 cities</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="3.99">where they&amp;#39;re able to pump that up maybe</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="3.15">they can&amp;#39;t do it in every single city in</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="5.88">the United States but if you go outside</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="6.42">of this area you know and you can see if</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.35">you go into Zillow if you go on to</text>
  <text start="336.41" dur="3.599">realtor.com or any of these sites you</text>
  <text start="338.69" dur="3.629">can see that people have been trying to</text>
  <text start="340.009" dur="3.78">sell their homes and they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.319" dur="3.961">move them and prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="343.789" dur="6.81">traffic is drying up we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="7.02">2007 and the following might explain why</text>
  <text start="350.599" dur="5.19">this is happening now according to the</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="4.799">data from the US Labor Department the</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="4.651">percentage of Americans in their prime</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="5.94">work years between the ages of 25 and 54</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="6.36">who actually have jobs well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="6.931">still way below the level the level</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="7.92">prior to the 2008 Great Recession wage</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="6.36">growth has been stagnant on top of that</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="4.8">debt levels are hitting record highs</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.98">student debt consumer debt auto loan</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="5.429">debt and the rest they&amp;#39;re hitting record</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="4.979">highs people are once again unable to</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="3.81">pay their debts over the last 12 months</text>
  <text start="387.289" dur="2.13">for example Capital One&amp;#39;s net</text>
  <text start="388.759" dur="4.321">charge-offs</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="8.961">increased by 40 percent cash levels are</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="9">also incredibly low and we can see that</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="6.94">many Americans they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="5.519">enough money now let&amp;#39;s see how much</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="4.23">money people actually have according to</text>
  <text start="407.599" dur="5.611">Bank of America&amp;#39;s annual report from</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="7.859">2016 it shows that the bank has 592</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="7.139">billion in consumer deposits from 46</text>
  <text start="417.409" dur="4.5">million households that works out to be</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="3.091">an average of about twelve thousand</text>
  <text start="421.909" dur="6.51">eight hundred and seventy now that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="7.59">per person that&amp;#39;s per household now this</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="6.391">includes everything savings investment</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="5.85">and retirement now if we go back 20</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="4.02">years ago and we look at Bank of</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="4.95">America&amp;#39;s annual report it showed that</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="6.36">the bank had 392 billion in deposits</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="6.389">from 30 million households that works</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="5.039">out to be 13 thousand 67 per household</text>
  <text start="448.219" dur="5.591">in 1997</text>
  <text start="450.229" dur="6.761">so today people</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="6.84">are saving or they have less than they</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="7.35">had in 1997 and this is 20 years later</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="6.739">and if you tack on inflation on top of</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="5.49">this which means the dollar value is</text>
  <text start="467.389" dur="5.25">decreased because you need more dollars</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="6.48">to pay for that product or that service</text>
  <text start="472.639" dur="7.301">they don&amp;#39;t have or we don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="7.079">much money this is the problem and</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="5.15">remember this includes investments which</text>
  <text start="483.389" dur="4.111">a lot of people can&amp;#39;t touch right down</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="4.45">retirement which a lot of people might</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.53">not be able to touch right now and the</text>
  <text start="489.54" dur="7.08">savings so you know the savings part of</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="7.05">it is much much less now Bank of America</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="5.21">is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="6.75">this could get ugly really really fast</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="6.49">now what they did is that the Bank of</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="5.13">America credit team they did something</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="5.159">so few finance professionals bother to</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="5.19">do these days they looked at fundamental</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="5.43">data to reach a conclusion that is</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="4.98">independent of how much the Apple stock</text>
  <text start="518.909" dur="4.831">from the S and B will have to buy to</text>
  <text start="521.13" dur="4.77">send the Dow Jones green specifically</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="5.04">the bank looked at liquidity situation</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="4.89">in the bond market and found that while</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="4.35">for the time being there is little to</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="4.53">worry about once the central bank&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="4.709">melts away that&amp;#39;s when the real test</text>
  <text start="535.32" dur="4.95">will take place and according to Bank of</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="3.211">America they&amp;#39;re saying that this could</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="5.04">get ugly</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="6.33">pretty darn fast and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="3.779">interesting about what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="3.959">the stock market what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="549.089" dur="5.041">real economy that we see these patterns</text>
  <text start="551.339" dur="5.071">repeat over and over and over again now</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="4.38">we don&amp;#39;t have the crashes at the same</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="4.38">exact time sometimes they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="4.32">manipulate the entire economy for a</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="3.57">longer period of time because they learn</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="3.42">from their mistakes and they keep adding</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="3.599">to them to make sure that they can</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="3.42">manipulate every part of the market and</text>
  <text start="567.959" dur="3.541">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now but</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="3.63">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="5.459">according to the last the latest</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="6.21">conference board survey 80% of Americans</text>
  <text start="576.959" dur="4.861">surveyed believe that stock prices will</text>
  <text start="579.51" dur="5.04">not be lower in the next 12 months now</text>
  <text start="581.82" dur="4.8">the last time the nation was so</text>
  <text start="584.55" dur="3.06">convinced of the markets permanently</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="6.089">high plateau</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="5.78">was in the fall of 2007 and guess what</text>
  <text start="592.709" dur="4.831">happened</text>
  <text start="593.39" dur="6.61">everything fell apart and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="6.239">going to happen again we they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="600" dur="8.67">this illusion that everything is great</text>
  <text start="603.779" dur="7.441">that many speculators they are long the</text>
  <text start="608.67" dur="6.419">Dow futures they believe that this will</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="7.77">never end and they did this back in 1929</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="8.071">and they did this back in 2008 and there</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="7.02">were many many people that lost out on</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="5.13">this and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="626.01" dur="4.92">this time because you know that this all</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="5.669">can&amp;#39;t be sustained the economy is</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="5.909">breaking down retail is a disaster</text>
  <text start="633.959" dur="5.731">housing is a disaster it is imploding on</text>
  <text start="636.839" dur="4.291">itself the GDP numbers are faked and</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="4.5">manipulated the unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="641.13" dur="5.13">faked and manipulated the stock market</text>
  <text start="644.19" dur="3.69">is completely manipulated we have</text>
  <text start="646.26" dur="3.509">central banks around the world buying</text>
  <text start="647.88" dur="3.81">all the different stocks to keep</text>
  <text start="649.769" dur="3.991">everything propped up and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="651.69" dur="3.63">have to buy that many I mean the fangs</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="3.36">all they have to do is buy a couple of</text>
  <text start="655.32" dur="4.17">them and it looks like everything is</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="4.62">doing really well and this is what</text>
