  <text start="43.899" dur="5.221">he&amp;#39;s saying that the mistrust of police</text>
  <text start="46.149" dur="4.711">is corroding America well I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="49.12" dur="4.65">say it&amp;#39;s completely opposite how about</text>
  <text start="50.86" dur="5.58">militarizing the police that is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.77" dur="3.84">corroding America there was a time where</text>
  <text start="56.44" dur="3.299">the police in each one of the</text>
  <text start="57.61" dur="3.629">neighborhoods work with the community</text>
  <text start="59.739" dur="5.011">they were there to serve and protect</text>
  <text start="61.239" dur="6.391">they were voted in by the community they</text>
  <text start="64.75" dur="5.63">were part of the community today what we</text>
  <text start="67.63" dur="7.31">see is the complete opposite we see</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="9.489">military assets being brought in like</text>
  <text start="74.94" dur="8.679">fatigues machine guns tanks police today</text>
  <text start="79.869" dur="5.371">point weapons at innocent people even if</text>
  <text start="83.619" dur="3.091">the people are walking down the street</text>
  <text start="85.24" dur="3.32">with their hands up police are</text>
  <text start="86.71" dur="4.53">continually pointing their weapons at</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="5.44">those people even though they did not</text>
  <text start="91.24" dur="4.919">commit any crimes they are having a</text>
  <text start="94" dur="4.17">peaceful gathering and of course Obama</text>
  <text start="96.159" dur="4.621">is trying to convince everyone that you</text>
  <text start="98.17" dur="4.559">need to trust these people you need to</text>
  <text start="100.78" dur="5.46">go along with what they see you need to</text>
  <text start="102.729" dur="6.721">obey them no not if they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="6.089">against the American people there is</text>
  <text start="109.45" dur="5.25">absolutely no reason to go along with</text>
  <text start="112.329" dur="4.951">the police if we see that something is</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="4.44">wrong with in the entire network and we</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="3.54">are seeing that things are completely</text>
  <text start="119.14" dur="4.53">falling apart and what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="120.82" dur="4.68">do they want everyone to obey they want</text>
  <text start="123.67" dur="4.649">everyone to be controlled and we could</text>
  <text start="125.5" dur="4.89">see DHS has infiltrated all the police</text>
  <text start="128.319" dur="4.081">forces throughout the United States or</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="3.659">at least most of them and of course they</text>
  <text start="132.4" dur="3.509">have given them grants they given them</text>
  <text start="134.049" dur="5.101">tangs they&amp;#39;ve been given them machine</text>
  <text start="135.909" dur="5.131">guns they&amp;#39;re being trained to to go</text>
  <text start="139.15" dur="3.75">after those people</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="3.929">that might be a threat to the government</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="3.809">officials and we can see from every</text>
  <text start="144.969" dur="5.52">single place that we see the militarized</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="5.971">police like in Boston in Ferguson this</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="4.86">is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and of</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="5.22">course Obama would love everyone just to</text>
  <text start="155.349" dur="4.89">obey them do what they say and just</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="5.22">everything will be okay we saw it at the</text>
  <text start="160.239" dur="4.86">Bundy ranch we saw the Bureau of Land</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="4.86">Management out there completely</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="5.821">militarized with weapons instead of</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="5.159">having some type of dialogue with the</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="4.5">rancher and you can see how this is</text>
  <text start="173.139" dur="4.591">starting to turn out all over the</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="4.439">country right now it their all all the</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="4.11">police forces are militarized at this</text>
  <text start="179.859" dur="3.33">point they&amp;#39;re all getting ready for what</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="3.269">is coming and that is a complete</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="3.2">collapse of the system and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="185.109" dur="3.901">just seeing it here in the United States</text>
  <text start="186.389" dur="4.18">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Spain we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="4.17">throughout Europe we&amp;#39;re seeing it in UK</text>
  <text start="190.569" dur="4.711">and of course they realize that when</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="6.179">this system comes down there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="5.639">be a lot of people who are upset and a</text>
  <text start="199.359" dur="3.481">lot of these people who are upset are</text>
  <text start="200.919" dur="3.091">going to get together a lot of people</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.299">are going to get together and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="4.02">to talk about removing the government</text>
  <text start="206.139" dur="5.641">infrastructure and starting over and</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="6.87">this thing they do not want now it looks</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="5.69">like there&amp;#39;s going to be about 600 US</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="5.25">soldiers with tanks to arrive in Poland</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="4.269">600 US soldiers accompanied by tanks and</text>

  <text start="224.319" dur="5.371">military exercises the US soldiers will</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="4.679">replace a more lightly armed force of</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="4.259">paratroopers and we&amp;#39;ll take part in a</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="3.87">rotational exercise meant to show the</text>
  <text start="233.949" dur="3.51">United States commitment to the NATO</text>
  <text start="235.419" dur="5.581">nations and they&amp;#39;re going to be coming</text>

  <text start="256.659" dur="4.23">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on there we see</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="4.709">China and Russia on one side we see the</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="4.291">United States on the other and each</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="4.56">country is fighting for the natural</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="4.62">resources inside of Africa and we can</text>
  <text start="267.699" dur="4.561">see that the United States is really</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="4.649">moving this forward and we can see their</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="3.54">agenda you have to remember China</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re think take look at the situation</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="6.72">in Africa as in the Pacific and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="4.769">a think tank came up with it yes the</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="5.639">United States is definitely trying to</text>
  <text start="284.319" dur="6.301">contain China trying to keep them out of</text>
  <text start="288.159" dur="5.1">these areas so they cannot take over the</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="5.009">Natural Resources remove the US dollar</text>
  <text start="293.259" dur="4.351">as a reserve currency and we see that</text>
  <text start="295.629" dur="4.111">wherever China and Russia are this is</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="6.299">exactly where the unit where the United</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="6.359">States will go now it looks like Russia</text>
  <text start="303.909" dur="6.56">is a little nervous about letting</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="7.29">foreign nations get a hold of their</text>
  <text start="310.469" dur="4.301">media so right now they&amp;#39;re passing laws</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="3.18">where they&amp;#39;re saying that foreign media</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="4.139">ownership is only going to be about</text>
  <text start="316.569" dur="3.87">twenty percent the Russian Duma has</text>
  <text start="318.909" dur="4.081">passed the final reading of a law</text>
  <text start="320.439" dur="4.56">forbidding holders of foreign passports</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.409">from controlling or owning more than</text>
  <text start="324.999" dur="3.9">twenty percent of any media outlet</text>
  <text start="327.399" dur="3.27">inside Russia and you know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.899" dur="5.07">doing this they&amp;#39;re very nervous about</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="6.96">the us about the UK getting inside the</text>
  <text start="333.969" dur="5.25">country and altering the media that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.629" dur="3.59">going on there just like they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="339.219" dur="4.711">our countries they&amp;#39;ve taken them over</text>
  <text start="341.219" dur="4.901">there in line with the corporations and</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="3.84">pretty much they lied to the American</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="3.09">people every single day they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="4.53">us the truth of what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.97">the same thing is a what happen in</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="7.679">Russia and this is why they do not want</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="8.009">any foreign a type of company to come in</text>
  <text start="359.979" dur="6.601">or person to come in and take over their</text>

  <text start="374.56" dur="3.389">designed to protect our national</text>
  <text start="375.789" dur="5.55">interest to safeguard the sovereignty of</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="5.28">our media and our country now here in</text>
  <text start="381.339" dur="4.681">the United States as we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.229" dur="4.8">about what six corporations that own all</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="3.569">of these media outlets and of course</text>
  <text start="388.029" dur="3.781">these corporations are in line with the</text>
  <text start="389.589" dur="3.991">US government and the US government says</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="3.93">listen if you want the stories you want</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="4.44">the information you will print what we</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="4.709">want to say and only what we want to say</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="3.78">and we&amp;#39;ll you will omit the things we</text>
  <text start="400.449" dur="2.671">don&amp;#39;t want you to cover and this is</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="3.329">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening here in the</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="3.24">United States and this is why most of</text>
  <text start="405.129" dur="2.531">the news that comes out of the corporate</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="4.3">media today really</text>
  <text start="407.66" dur="5.34">make any sense anymore and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="4.65">viewers who are looking at these media</text>
  <text start="413" dur="5.39">outlets their viewership is dropping</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="5.82">because things are not making sense now</text>
  <text start="418.39" dur="4.96">Russia just like the United States where</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="4.98">Obama came out saying that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="423.35" dur="4.68">spend one trillion dollars on their</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="5.76">nuclear arsenal Russia is saying the</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="6.75">same thing Russia&amp;#39;s Lavrov says it is</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="4.95">time that the country to modernize its</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="3.84">nuclear and conventional Arsenal&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t think we are on the verge of a new</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="5.01">arms race at least Russia definitely</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="3.81">won&amp;#39;t be a part of it in our case is</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="3.84">just that the time has come for us to</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="4.62">modernize our nuclear and conventional</text>
  <text start="447.47" dur="4.14">Arsenal&amp;#39;s now I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re at an</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="3.81">arms race were at this point I think</text>
  <text start="451.61" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re heading to world war three and the</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="4.05">central bankers know exactly the path</text>
  <text start="455.84" dur="4.26">that they&amp;#39;re taking this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="4.77">improving the nuclear arsenals Russia</text>
  <text start="460.1" dur="4.35">China the other BRIC nations know</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="3.66">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on and this is why</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re beefing up their military assets</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="6.12">now out in Libya we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="4.71">old government has just sworn in the</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="3.54">parliament and basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.77" dur="3.3">meaningless at this point in time</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="4.26">because what&amp;#39;s happening is the tribes</text>
  <text start="478.07" dur="6.45">in Libya have taken over the country</text>
  <text start="480.14" dur="6.48">most of the Parliament is on this ferry</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="3.33">that is sitting outside of Libya right</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="3.09">down this is where they&amp;#39;re holding all</text>
  <text start="487.85" dur="4.41">their meetings and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="5.01">another call to the United Nations and</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="5.61">to most of the western-backed country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="6.93">central Central Bank Western countries</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="7.14">here and they&amp;#39;re looking to have more</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.46">weapons and help come into Libya Libya</text>
  <text start="505.01" dur="4.26">on Saturday at the United Nations ask</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="4.05">the world either to give it more weapons</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="4.35">and other support to help restore</text>
  <text start="511.16" dur="4.379">security because they have completely</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="4.77">lost what is going on here the Libyan</text>
  <text start="515.539" dur="5.791">government is unable to control brigades</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="5.76">of former rebels who helped oust Moammar</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="4.77">Qaddafi so we can see right now all of</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="3.53">them are turning on the government</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re joining in with the tribes and</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re pretty much taken over a lot of</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="4.95">Libya at this point and this is why the</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="5.039">United States has removed all government</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="3.93">officials inside of Libya pretty much</text>
  <text start="538.339" dur="2.761">closed the embassy because they see</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="4.14">what&amp;#39;s going on it looks like</text>
  <text start="541.1" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s a repeat of Iran now in Yemen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.95" dur="5.52">seeing the same exact thing the US</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="5.28">Embassy in Yemen has supposedly come</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="4.35">under attack fire attack from al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="551.66" dur="4.98">which I really think is the rebels who</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="5.82">are trying to push the US government out</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="4.92">of this area and they want everyone</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="5.22">pretty much out the US Embassy deny that</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="4.5">it was a target of this attack and a</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="3.84">statement said the embassy was</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="4.38">unaffected by the rocket strike but</text>
  <text start="568.7" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s happening is the State Department</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="5.22">reporting a high security threat level</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="5.73">and is urging more and more Americans to</text>
  <text start="575.66" dur="4.02">leave Yemen immediately and we can see</text>
  <text start="578.39" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s the same thing that happened in</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="5.07">Libya a lot of the foreign nations came</text>
  <text start="582.32" dur="4.62">in remove their personnel from the</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="3.78">embassies the same things happening in</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="3.15">Yemen right now the United States is</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="3.81">going to be evacuating the embassy</text>
  <text start="590.09" dur="3.74">eventually but right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="4.59">a lot of them should leave because</text>
  <text start="593.83" dur="4.45">things are starting to fall apart and it</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="4.83">looks like we&amp;#39;re having a repeat of our</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="6.93">of Iran at this time so Libya is fallen</text>

  <text start="621.74" dur="4.53">fight with terrorism Iran of course</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="4.11">should be part of the efforts to fight</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="4.68">ISIL because Iran is the strong opponent</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="3.6">of this group and of course the United</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="2.73">States wants nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="4.26">because this is not part of their plan</text>
  <text start="633.68" dur="5.16">their plan is to get into Syria to</text>
  <text start="636.44" dur="3.75">occupy it then move into a random of</text>
  <text start="638.84" dur="3.12">course they just can&amp;#39;t go ahead and do</text>
  <text start="640.19" dur="4.4">this because would be obvious if they</text>
  <text start="641.96" dur="5.46">did this so what they&amp;#39;re using is</text>
  <text start="644.59" dur="7.33">they&amp;#39;re using the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="6.06">using this to get everyone on board with</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="4.8">the idea that we&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="653.48" dur="5.07">terrorism and slowly but surely what</text>
  <text start="656.72" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll convince you that</text>
  <text start="658.55" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re going to need boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="5.4">that we already know boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="662.63" dur="5.13">are headed towards a rack they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="4.74">to spike air this is the base inside</text>
  <text start="667.76" dur="4.89">Iraq we know about 13,000 troops are</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="3.899">headed there and we can see already the</text>
  <text start="672.65" dur="3.869">calls from the government official</text>
  <text start="674.329" dur="4.081">and we also know from the military</text>
  <text start="676.519" dur="4.23">officials saying that we can&amp;#39;t win this</text>
  <text start="678.41" dur="4.229">with just air power and of course they</text>
  <text start="680.749" dur="4.171">promised us no boots on the ground but</text>
  <text start="682.639" dur="3.66">this is how they do it they tell you no</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="3.149">boots on the ground no boots on the</text>
  <text start="686.299" dur="3.33">ground no boots on the ground they bring</text>
  <text start="688.069" dur="3.99">in a couple of advisors you know a</text>
  <text start="689.629" dur="4.531">couple thousand of a visor they just</text>
  <text start="692.059" dur="4.77">tell you their advisers they set up a</text>
  <text start="694.16" dur="4.799">base they set up a division they bring</text>
  <text start="696.829" dur="4.021">the troops in and then they start coming</text>
  <text start="698.959" dur="2.97">out with you know air power is not going</text>
  <text start="700.85" dur="3.81">to do it we&amp;#39;re going to need boots on</text>
  <text start="701.929" dur="4.08">the ground the president says no and the</text>
  <text start="704.66" dur="3.329">government officials continually say</text>
  <text start="706.009" dur="3.36">this John Boehner is out there saying</text>
  <text start="707.989" dur="4.111">that the United States may have no</text>
  <text start="709.369" dur="4.65">choice but to send American troops so</text>
  <text start="712.1" dur="3.209">they&amp;#39;re getting everyone ready for boots</text>
  <text start="714.019" dur="5.49">on the ground and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="715.309" dur="6.421">saying this now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="719.509" dur="5.221">United States would love to put a no-fly</text>
  <text start="721.73" dur="5.519">zone in the eastern part of Syria and</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="5.759">right now and what this would do</text>
  <text start="727.249" dur="4.83">basically is disable the Syrian Air</text>
  <text start="730.489" dur="3.481">Force and this is exactly what they want</text>
  <text start="732.079" dur="6.81">to do because if you notice the area&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.97" dur="7.559">Rocca Dale our soul and Aleppo these are</text>
  <text start="738.889" dur="3.901">the places where they had air bases in</text>
  <text start="741.529" dur="3.03">this is where the Islamic state took</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="4.079">over these areas and they pretty much</text>
  <text start="744.559" dur="4.86">demolish the air bases so they cannot be</text>
  <text start="746.869" dur="5.611">used that cannot be retaken general</text>
  <text start="749.419" dur="6">Dempsey added that a buffer zone might</text>
  <text start="752.48" dur="5.189">at some point become a possibility but</text>
  <text start="755.419" dur="4.92">he said it was not imminent creating a</text>
  <text start="757.669" dur="5.16">buffer or no-fly zone would require</text>
  <text start="760.339" dur="5.071">warplanes to disable the Syrian</text>
  <text start="762.829" dur="6.35">government&amp;#39;s air defense systems through</text>
  <text start="765.41" dur="6.389">air strikes so you can see at this point</text>
  <text start="769.179" dur="4.361">they&amp;#39;re not targeting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="771.799" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re already getting prepped or</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re already getting ready and</text>
  <text start="775.929" dur="6.31">preparing to strike and keep the Syrian</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="4.469">Air Force grounded and this is why they</text>
  <text start="782.239" dur="3.81">went through the east this is why they</text>
  <text start="784.129" dur="3.3">destroyed the air bases there this is</text>
  <text start="786.049" dur="3.991">why they&amp;#39;re destroying the refineries</text>
  <text start="787.429" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re basically taking a step-by-step</text>
  <text start="790.04" dur="5.519">approach demolishing the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="792.679" dur="5.46">in this area now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="795.559" dur="5.731">saying that the Islamic state is using</text>
  <text start="798.139" dur="5.25">chlorine gas inside of Iraq and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="4.7">trying to track where they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="803.389" dur="4.801">this chlorine gas and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="805.99" dur="4.06">where exactly this is</text>
  <text start="808.19" dur="3.75">coming from and what they come out with</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="3.66">and what they say but they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="811.94" dur="5.54">Islamic state extremists have used</text>
  <text start="813.71" dur="5.79">chlorine in full gas several times</text>
  <text start="817.48" dur="4.45">Islamic state have used chlorine a</text>
  <text start="819.5" dur="4.29">number of areas near water treatment</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="3.18">plants and right now they&amp;#39;re saying no</text>
  <text start="823.79" dur="4.44">one has really been affected but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="825.11" dur="8.55">continually using this on the people</text>
  <text start="828.23" dur="10.32">inside Iraq now serious al-qaeda chief</text>
  <text start="833.66" dur="6.72">warns that if the strikes continue they</text>
  <text start="838.55" dur="5.16">are going to take the war to the west</text>
  <text start="840.38" dur="5.52">the head of Syria&amp;#39;s al-qaeda affiliate</text>
  <text start="843.71" dur="5.31">warned on Sunday that a failure to stop</text>
  <text start="845.9" dur="5.61">us-led airstrikes on jihadist positions</text>

  <text start="861.68" dur="4.77">Islamic state affiliate come together</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="4.02">and say maybe we should be as one and of</text>
  <text start="866.45" dur="3.84">course this is exactly what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="868.07" dur="4.02">happen in the future we&amp;#39;ll only know all</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="3.41">of these terrorist groups by one name</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="4.41">and that is the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="873.7" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re saying that the failure to stop</text>
  <text start="876.5" dur="3.72">these strikes will transfer the battle</text>
  <text start="878.06" dur="5.91">to your very homes and this is coming</text>

  <text start="886.64" dur="4.41">saying that you better stop and this is</text>
  <text start="888.89" dur="5.4">how we can see they are getting ready to</text>
