  <text start="302.599" dur="4.021">candidate the election and it validated</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="3.63">the primary reason the Trump</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.859">administration fired call me as FBI</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="4.95">director a few months later second let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.479" dur="5.101">remember that Comey was the man who</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="6.059">famously testified in 2016 that the FBI</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="5.64">agents don&amp;#39;t give a hoot about politics</text>
  <text start="319.669" dur="5.821">when they investigate which is a</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="5.61">complete lie a year later we learned</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="3.799">that the very FBI employees call me and</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="2.67">trusted to lead the Clinton and Trump</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="3.91">investigations</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="5.4">Peter stroke leaves a page obsessed over</text>
  <text start="333.199" dur="4.59">the 2016 election and even discussed in</text>
  <text start="335.9" dur="3.69">government text messages using their</text>
  <text start="337.789" dur="5.671">official powers to stop Trump from</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="6.329">becoming president third commis</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="4.23">investigative team in the form of the</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="4.141">steel dossier and his general counsel</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="4.68">James Baker in the form of evidence from</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="4.65">the Democratic Party lawyer accepted</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="6.03">politically tainted evidence to further</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="5.429">the probe of Trump finally Comey has</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="5.579">insisted he didn&amp;#39;t condone leaking</text>
  <text start="360.139" dur="6.181">inside the FBI yet on his watch deputy</text>
  <text start="363.979" dur="4.861">top deputy Andrew McCabe was caught</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="4.61">leaking to the news media and later</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="8.22">fired for lying about it</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="8.35">so in summary James Comey approved the</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="4.5">series of Pfizer warrants to surveil</text>
  <text start="379.28" dur="4.35">Trump without having any knowledge</text>

  <text start="383.63" dur="6.12">colluded with Russia Comey said in his</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="5.28">toastin testimony that in July 2016 when</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="6.78">all this started the FBI didn&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="401.15" dur="3.63">Pfizer&amp;#39;s kept getting renewed for a</text>
  <text start="402.949" dur="3.81">while into a good faith actors in the</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="5.43">Trump administration realized the extent</text>
  <text start="406.759" dur="5.791">of what was going on Conley also said in</text>

  <text start="412.55" dur="5.16">still don&amp;#39;t know whether there was</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="8.13">anything to it well there you have it</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="7.56">the whole thing was a complete hoax now</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="4.529">this new evidence further disqualifies</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="2.729">the Russian collusion narrative by</text>

  <text start="427.999" dur="4.44">the whole thing was a setup orchestrated</text>

  <text start="472.839" dur="8.17">completely fake now the Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="478.189" dur="6.6">campaign issued a press release on</text>
  <text start="481.009" dur="5.851">September 24 2016 promoting information</text>

  <text start="486.86" dur="4.019">the press release has almost completely</text>
  <text start="488.659" dur="4.891">been scrubbed from the internet but it</text>
  <text start="490.879" dur="5.97">is preserved in at least one tweet and</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="7.679">in an Internet Archive sponsored by the</text>

  <text start="501.229" dur="7.02">that Clinton was pushing this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="4.59">amazing what the Internet can do for you</text>
  <text start="508.249" dur="5.4">because you can always get the</text>

  <text start="513.649" dur="4.98">really doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s deleted because</text>
  <text start="515.769" dur="4.63">people take snapshots of it now if</text>
  <text start="518.629" dur="3.93">someone takes a snapshot of it and then</text>
  <text start="520.399" dur="6.5">you try to delete it well you have the</text>
  <text start="522.559" dur="6.75">archive and it shows up in other places</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="5.321">let&amp;#39;s move on to what is happening with</text>
  <text start="529.309" dur="5.101">border security in the wall now we see</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="6.859">the Dems they introduced a bill</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="8.33">requiring Mexico to pay for the wall now</text>
  <text start="539.079" dur="5.591">this is not going to work whatsoever</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="4.63">representative Sheila Jackson Lee of</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="4.26">Texas introduced legislation forbidding</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="3.509">construction of the wall on the</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="4.29">us-mexico Mexico border and unless</text>
  <text start="550.879" dur="4.26">Mexico pays for it now a bill passed</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="3.21">here which is it&amp;#39;s probably not going to</text>
  <text start="555.139" dur="4.531">go anywhere</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="7.77">this bill that was introduced even if it</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="9.03">passes has no effect on Mexico they</text>
  <text start="564.2" dur="8.699">don&amp;#39;t abide by our laws so this is just</text>
  <text start="568.7" dur="6.63">a method of trying to stop the</text>
  <text start="572.899" dur="5.341">inevitable of the wall being built it is</text>
  <text start="575.33" dur="5.509">not going to work and remember that</text>
  <text start="578.24" dur="6.03">NAFTA was completely renegotiated and</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="5.321">because of the New Deal we and Mexico</text>
  <text start="584.27" dur="5.4">was negotiating with the United States</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="6.6">because of this new deal it saved the</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="6.75">United States billions of dollars so yes</text>
  <text start="592.76" dur="6.75">indirectly Mexico will be paying for</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="4.8">this wall because they decided to</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="3.48">negotiate with the United States for</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="4.86">this new deal and save the United States</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="5.76">a lot of money and by the way I do</text>
  <text start="606.08" dur="4.68">believe that eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="4.29">happen his Trump is going to get rid of</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="7.88">all of these deals and create completely</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="9.87">new ones once the transition is complete</text>
  <text start="618.64" dur="6.58">now Trump is out there and he tweeted</text>
  <text start="622.91" dur="5.31">out something very interesting where he</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="7.43">completely agrees with Obama back in</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="10.77">2011 and he tweeted out I totally agree</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="8.92">what did he agree with well Obama came</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="5.01">out on January 25th 2011 and said I</text>
  <text start="641.57" dur="4.59">strongly believe that we should take on</text>
  <text start="644" dur="6.42">once and for all the issue of illegal</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="7.11">immigration and Trump says I agree with</text>
  <text start="650.42" dur="5.039">this because Trump continually shows</text>
  <text start="653.27" dur="4.05">everyone that these people were talking</text>
  <text start="655.459" dur="3.721">about walls they were talking about</text>
  <text start="657.32" dur="4.38">border security they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="4.649">illegal immigration of course they</text>
  <text start="661.7" dur="4.139">weren&amp;#39;t really they weren&amp;#39;t really going</text>
  <text start="663.829" dur="4.411">to do something about it they were just</text>
  <text start="665.839" dur="4.411">talking and making sure that they were</text>
  <text start="668.24" dur="4.05">giving people what they wanted while</text>
  <text start="670.25" dur="3.959">they did everything else in the</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="3.65">background that had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="674.209" dur="5.04">what the people really wanted</text>
  <text start="675.94" dur="7.399">that&amp;#39;s a politician for you</text>
  <text start="679.249" dur="6.64">so we see at this time that something</text>
  <text start="683.339" dur="5.701">happened in California and Trump is</text>
  <text start="685.889" dur="6.06">using this right now Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="4.649">the following there is right now a</text>
  <text start="691.949" dur="3.06">full-scale manhunt going on in</text>

  <text start="1740.389" dur="4.89">counsel were BS from the beginning Huber</text>
  <text start="1742.97" dur="4.65">and Horowitz well they kinda lay</text>
  <text start="1745.279" dur="4.561">everything on the table now Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1747.62" dur="5.07">explanation of what Mueller&amp;#39;s objective</text>
  <text start="1749.84" dur="4.62">is is to withhold evidence that could be</text>

  <text start="1763.549" dur="4.291">Ron Rosen Stein complies and the rest of</text>
  <text start="1766.159" dur="4.051">the Department of Justice has to go</text>
  <text start="1767.84" dur="4.29">along so after five two D class and</text>
  <text start="1770.21" dur="4.8">everyone knows that mewls investigation</text>
  <text start="1772.13" dur="5.279">is BS Huber and Horowitz come out and</text>
  <text start="1775.01" dur="4.74">say they have lots of good leads than</text>
  <text start="1777.409" dur="4.38">some serious evidence but that Mueller</text>
  <text start="1779.75" dur="4.35">and Ron Rosenstein had been obstructing</text>
  <text start="1781.789" dur="4.5">their work suddenly the world sees just</text>
