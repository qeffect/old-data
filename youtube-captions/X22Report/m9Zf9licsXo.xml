  <text start="107.649" dur="4.86">been pushing this side up all day long</text>
  <text start="109.869" dur="4.651">and it&amp;#39;s strange that the market would</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="3.75">be tumbling down when they got such</text>
  <text start="114.52" dur="6.06">great news that the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="116.259" dur="8.491">has dropped a five percent where October</text>
  <text start="120.58" dur="5.73">payrolls soared by 270 1000 slashing the</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="5.52">consensus of about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="7.23">eighty-four thousand and if we look at</text>
  <text start="130.27" dur="5.81">this you know from everything it seems</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="5.94">that yeah we&amp;#39;re in recovery everything</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="5.65">is fine there is absolutely nothing to</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="5.46">worry about whatsoever I mean this is</text>
  <text start="141.73" dur="7.53">the lowest unemployment rate since April</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="7.8">of 2008 wait a minute we know what</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="8.28">happened in October of 2008 the system</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="8.579">fell apart and it collapsed and right</text>
  <text start="157.54" dur="6.95">now the government the central bank is</text>
  <text start="161.319" dur="6.201">continually manipulating all</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="7.59">these numbers and they are going</text>
  <text start="167.52" dur="7.29">overboard now to prove that we are in a</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="5.4">recovery and when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="6.72">these numbers we have to see who is</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="6.9">getting hired during this period well</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="5.52">education and health was about 57,000</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="6.66">jobs professional services 54,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="8.34">retail trade 44,000 trade jobs leisure</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="6.54">and hospitality 41,000 temp help 25,000</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="6.18">manufacturing this is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="5.72">numbers we&amp;#39;ve seen zero no jobs for</text>
  <text start="201.57" dur="5.34">manufacturing whatsoever actually</text>
  <text start="203.3" dur="7.39">manufacturing jobs are being lost so</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="6.93">what we are seeing are low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="7.1">and there is no manufacturing at this</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="6.33">point and when we look at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="3.52">compared to waiters and bartenders and I</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="4.8">have nothing against waiters or</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="6.26">bartenders everyone has their job but</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="6.06">what we&amp;#39;re seeing as we continually lose</text>
  <text start="227.57" dur="5.8">manufacturing jobs the part-time work is</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="4.08">continually increasing waiters and</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="5.28">bartenders jobs have increased since</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="7.32">2007 by 1.5 million manufacturing job</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="5.37">losses have decreased by 1.4 million so</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="3.75">it kind of shows you where all these</text>
  <text start="244.02" dur="4.32">people are going because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="4.8">the manufacturing jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="6.51">taking any type of part-time job just to</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="6.84">make ends meet now when we look at these</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="4.41">job numbers we say okay about three</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="3.18">hundred and seventy eight thousand</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re telling us people were hired in</text>
  <text start="261" dur="5.28">these different positions and when we</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="8.49">look at it we see that the gains are</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="8.28">from workers aged 55 and over well 55</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="4.38">and over most of these people or a lot</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.06">of them are heading towards retirement</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="6.27">and some have already retired and</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re getting hired right now at these</text>
  <text start="282.48" dur="5.84">part-time low-paid jobs because they</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="6.83">know that they&amp;#39;re going to be there and</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;re not looking to get more money</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="7.709">they just supplementing their retirement</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="8.929">and they know they&amp;#39;re reliable</text>
  <text start="298.879" dur="7.361">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="303.319" dur="5.291">workers aged 55 and older are taking up</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="4.56">the jobs all the part-time jobs because</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="4.47">they can&amp;#39;t function with their</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="6.179">retirement because of inflation on food</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="8.179">and other things and workers from ages</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="8.821">25 to 54 have declined by 35,000 and</text>
  <text start="321.259" dur="9.28">males in this age group that number</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="7.5">tumbled to 119,000 so we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="330.539" dur="6.78">decline of a hundred and nineteen</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="9.659">thousand jobs of workers work or males</text>
  <text start="337.319" dur="8.12">from 25 to 50 to 54 this is going to be</text>
  <text start="342.959" dur="7.68">a problem and we&amp;#39;re seeing it right now</text>
  <text start="345.439" dur="9.46">this economy cannot be sustained this</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="8.55">way we cannot have a society of</text>
  <text start="354.899" dur="9.181">part-time work we cannot have people</text>
  <text start="359.189" dur="7.111">continually losing jobs and going from</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="7.47">these full-time jobs two part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="10.019">it just won&amp;#39;t work we are seeing a</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="7.199">complete collapse of the system now</text>
  <text start="376.319" dur="6.39">workers aged 55 and older have gained</text>
  <text start="378.749" dur="7.41">over 7.5 million jobs in the past eight</text>
  <text start="382.709" dur="8.52">years workers aged 55 and under have</text>
  <text start="386.159" dur="8.97">lost 4.6 million jobs over the last</text>
  <text start="391.229" dur="8.25">eight years I mean think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="7.89">going on here this is a major major</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="5.67">problem and what we&amp;#39;re looking at is</text>
  <text start="403.019" dur="6.93">there are more and more people being</text>
  <text start="405.149" dur="6.931">thrown out of the labor force the</text>
  <text start="409.949" dur="5.27">household survey reported that the</text>
  <text start="412.08" dur="6.179">civilian labor force rose by over about</text>
  <text start="415.219" dur="5.35">300,000 in October the number of people</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="9.75">not in the labor force actually declined</text>
  <text start="420.569" dur="9.21">by 97,000 to 90 4.5 million and we know</text>
  <text start="428.009" dur="3.96">there was a half a million in September</text>
  <text start="429.779" dur="4.71">that were dropped out of the labor force</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="5.82">so the participation rate remained at</text>
  <text start="434.489" dur="9.33">sixty 2.4% same as the prior month and</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="11.31">at a level last seen in 1977 that is a</text>
  <text start="443.819" dur="9.48">lot of people not working and if we are</text>
  <text start="449.099" dur="8.011">in a full recovery why are close to a</text>
  <text start="453.299" dur="7.65">hundred million people looking for work</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="7.889">and why do we have most of our jobs</text>
  <text start="460.949" dur="7.71">being brought to us by part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="464.999" dur="8.51">not full-time jobs why is challenger</text>
  <text start="468.659" dur="8.42">gray &amp;amp; christmas a firm that tracks</text>
  <text start="473.509" dur="6.49">layoffs reporting so far this year</text>
  <text start="477.079" dur="8.17">there&amp;#39;s been a half a million plus</text>
  <text start="479.999" dur="8.9">layoffs if we go back to jun 2014 we are</text>
  <text start="485.249" dur="8.82">approaching 1 million layoffs from good</text>
  <text start="488.899" dur="7.901">full-time jobs and we can see it all</text>
  <text start="494.069" dur="4.77">over the economy it&amp;#39;s just getting worse</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="4.469">and worse but the government and the</text>
  <text start="498.839" dur="4.8">central bank is doing its best to</text>
  <text start="501.269" dur="4.11">convince us we&amp;#39;re in recovery now a</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="2.76">couple reports back I said we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="4.05">to be approaching four point nine</text>
  <text start="506.399" dur="4.711">percent i am not going to be that</text>
  <text start="509.429" dur="3.63">surprised if we hit four point nine</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="4.5">percent either by the end of this year</text>
  <text start="513.059" dur="4.38">or the beginning of 2016 because we know</text>
  <text start="515.61" dur="3.329">2016 is an election year and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.439" dur="5.01">going to bring that number way way down</text>
  <text start="518.939" dur="5.82">and the fed is going to have a very</text>
  <text start="522.449" dur="4.2">tough time because we are getting to the</text>
  <text start="524.759" dur="3.89">point where we&amp;#39;re better than a recovery</text>
  <text start="526.649" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re better than the good times</text>
  <text start="528.649" dur="5.8">unemployment is incredible why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="531.809" dur="3.811">they raise the interest rates and this</text>
  <text start="534.449" dur="4.64">is going to put a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="5.88">them and remember if the Fed decides to</text>
  <text start="539.089" dur="4.3">increase the interest rates this is when</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="3.329">everyone should get worried because this</text>
  <text start="543.389" dur="3.93">is when they&amp;#39;re ready to bring down the</text>
  <text start="544.829" dur="4.8">economy we saw it back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="547.319" dur="6.69">eight this economy is the same of two</text>
  <text start="549.629" dur="6">thousand eight times 100 or x 1000 and</text>
  <text start="554.009" dur="3.87">when we saw the interest rates rise back</text>
  <text start="555.629" dur="4.2">then it completely collapsed what do you</text>
  <text start="557.879" dur="3.661">think is going to happen right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.829" dur="3.51">going to do the same thing and they know</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="4.44">it this is why they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="563.339" dur="5.161">nerp this is why they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="5.7">at zero percent because they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="4.83">now the Baltic Dry Index fell once again</text>
  <text start="571.68" dur="7.62">this is the raw material the factories</text>
  <text start="573.33" dur="9.75">used to produce goods it fell to 631 now</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="5.88">typically this time of year we see</text>
  <text start="583.08" dur="5.07">demand picking up because the holidays</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="6.12">coming in people are bringing in a lot</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="7.23">more goods stacking up their inventory</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="7.61">and the bolted right index rises from</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="6.93">mid summer through the holiday season</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="7.45">but it hasn&amp;#39;t been doing that it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="602.31" dur="6.69">going the opposite way and this should</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="6.83">say wait a minute what is going on here</text>
  <text start="609" dur="7.02">something&amp;#39;s wrong and something is wrong</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="5.1">basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="6">American people the world population</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="5.47">there&amp;#39;s so much unemployment the people</text>
  <text start="622.02" dur="3.54">do not have discretionary funds and</text>
  <text start="623.76" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re not purchasing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="625.56" dur="3.69">purchasing then the stores don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="2.97">order the stores don&amp;#39;t have to order the</text>
  <text start="629.25" dur="2.79">factories don&amp;#39;t have to produce the</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="3.78">factories don&amp;#39;t have to produce they</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="5.18">don&amp;#39;t have to order the raw material and</text>
  <text start="634.44" dur="4.98">this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="3.7">even though the government of the United</text>
  <text start="639.42" dur="5.67">States is telling us the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="640.92" dur="6.54">a five percent what what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="645.09" dur="4.71">happening right now is the complete</text>
  <text start="647.46" dur="3.84">opposite and I&amp;#39;ve always said whenever</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="3.69">the government tries to tell something</text>
  <text start="651.3" dur="4.53">it is always the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re telling us so they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="655.83" dur="4.65">unemployment is in full recovery at five</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="6.21">percent this unemployment number is</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="6.75">close to thirty thirty-five percent this</text>
  <text start="664.5" dur="5.55">is what we&amp;#39;re really seeing now if we</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="8.22">look at freight carriers freight</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="8.9">carriers completely imploded and it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="675.45" dur="7.2">a downward trend if we look at trucking</text>
  <text start="678.95" dur="6.94">us load to truck ratio it is declining</text>
  <text start="682.65" dur="4.98">and falling apart because again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.89" dur="3.72">nothing being shipped to stores yes</text>
  <text start="687.63" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a little bit going on but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.61" dur="5.73">decreasing every single day it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="6.48">getting better and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="695.34" dur="4.439">right now is a complete collapse of the</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="3.389">entire system</text>
  <text start="699.779" dur="4.05">yes the government has the ability to</text>
  <text start="701.579" dur="4.711">say to manipulate the statistical</text>
  <text start="703.829" dur="5.281">numbers to manipulate the stock market</text>
  <text start="706.29" dur="5.549">to manipulate precious metals but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="5.159">very difficult to manipulate all the</text>
  <text start="711.839" dur="5.73">people on the sidelines who can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="714.269" dur="5.961">work you can see those people you can</text>
  <text start="717.569" dur="6.69">feel those people you can&amp;#39;t hide that</text>
  <text start="720.23" dur="7.45">trucking is declining train freight</text>
  <text start="724.259" dur="6.661">deliveries is declining you can&amp;#39;t hide</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="5.819">the raw material shipment around the</text>
  <text start="730.92" dur="6.779">world it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do and you</text>

  <text start="737.699" dur="5.281">difficult to do and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="739.589" dur="4.86">seeing right now and yes they can get</text>
  <text start="742.98" dur="3.81">rid of their Department that tracks</text>
  <text start="744.449" dur="3.961">layoffs which they did back in 2013 but</text>
  <text start="746.79" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s other private firms and they</text>
  <text start="748.41" dur="4.349">can&amp;#39;t manipulate these type of firms I</text>
  <text start="751.319" dur="3.57">mean they can manipulate some of them</text>
  <text start="752.759" dur="4.351">but there&amp;#39;s a lot that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="754.889" dur="3.99">manipulate and the information gets out</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="3.839">there and this is what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="758.879" dur="7.2">right now we are seeing a complete</text>
  <text start="760.949" dur="9.031">breakdown now China is pushing forward</text>
  <text start="766.079" dur="6.421">with their currency Russia has become</text>
  <text start="769.98" dur="5.7">the fourth country to open its bond</text>
  <text start="772.5" dur="7.319">market to the Chinese you won so right</text>
  <text start="775.68" dur="8.459">now we see China we see London we see</text>
  <text start="779.819" dur="6.12">South Korea and this is starting to</text>
  <text start="784.139" dur="4.68">spread right now because China is</text>
  <text start="785.939" dur="5.611">looking to become a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="788.819" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re pushing as hard as they can to</text>
  <text start="791.55" dur="6.509">have this completed now i am not saying</text>
  <text start="794.699" dur="6.031">that russia china they are the answer to</text>
  <text start="798.059" dur="8.311">these to this problem what I&amp;#39;m saying is</text>
  <text start="800.73" dur="7.38">that this whole entire system is a fight</text>
  <text start="806.37" dur="4.05">between the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="808.11" dur="5.159">system and the central banking system of</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="6.12">China Russia and what they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="813.269" dur="5.01">which is the bricks and two of them are</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="3.69">buttin heads now a lot of people say</text>
  <text start="818.279" dur="4.05">that everything is moving from the west</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="4.769">to the east which of course central</text>
  <text start="822.329" dur="4.891">bankers will do this because they have</text>
  <text start="824.999" dur="5.13">no allegiance to a country they have no</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="5.849">allegiance to a people and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="830.129" dur="3.841">care where they&amp;#39;re located and who sets</text>
  <text start="833.069" dur="2.221">it up and</text>
  <text start="833.97" dur="4.859">who is the reserve currency it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.29" dur="6.96">meaningless to them but when we look at</text>
  <text start="838.829" dur="5.671">the United States remember the</text>
  <text start="842.25" dur="5.85">government is intertwined right now with</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="5.16">the central banking system and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.1" dur="4.669">many different central banking systems</text>
  <text start="849.66" dur="5.609">which is a hierarchy of the main central</text>
  <text start="852.769" dur="5.8">central bank system which is controlled</text>
  <text start="855.269" dur="6.091">by the Rothschilds so we see right now</text>
  <text start="858.569" dur="6.421">that they don&amp;#39;t really care this system</text>
  <text start="861.36" dur="6.959">is dying we know it&amp;#39;s dying and usually</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="4.86">what central banks do to cover up this</text>
  <text start="868.319" dur="4.291">entire thing because they can&amp;#39;t restart</text>
  <text start="869.85" dur="4.529">it anywhere else is they need some type</text>
  <text start="872.61" dur="6.95">of war and this is where this is what</text>
  <text start="874.379" dur="8.341">they&amp;#39;re pushing right now now Iran is</text>
  <text start="879.56" dur="6.79">looking to have and open up a secret</text>
  <text start="882.72" dur="5.58">passage to Asia for Russian crude Russia</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="5.669">is looking to expand its influence</text>
  <text start="888.3" dur="6.93">through oil trade and a little reported</text>
  <text start="892.019" dur="5.31">deal this week may give may give us some</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="7.02">insight in what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="897.329" dur="7.74">here Russia is close to negotiating a</text>
  <text start="902.25" dur="5.1">secret passage for its oil shipments the</text>
  <text start="905.069" dur="4.171">move is coming through a deal with Iran</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="4.409">which the government says could open up</text>
  <text start="909.24" dur="4.889">the door for crude oil swamps between</text>
  <text start="911.759" dur="4.8">the two countries facilitating exports</text>
  <text start="914.129" dur="4.4">of Russian oil out into Asia and beyond</text>
  <text start="916.559" dur="5.34">and this is how it&amp;#39;s going to work</text>
  <text start="918.529" dur="4.841">Russia lacks the access to the ocean</text>
  <text start="921.899" dur="3.54">shipping routes beyond the Pacific and</text>
  <text start="923.37" dur="4.949">Arctic Iran has better access through</text>
  <text start="925.439" dur="4.851">its ports on the Persian Gulf but Russia</text>
  <text start="928.319" dur="4.591">does have ports on the Caspian Sea</text>
  <text start="930.29" dur="5.469">Russia and Iran can exchange crude oil</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="4.83">shipments along the Caspian Sea the swap</text>
  <text start="935.759" dur="4.08">scheme would see Russian crude oil sent</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="4.74">to Iran in exchange for equal shipments</text>
  <text start="939.839" dur="4.35">of Iranian crude flowing to Russia that</text>
  <text start="942.48" dur="4.039">will give Russian unprecedented access</text>
  <text start="944.189" dur="5.15">to markets around the Indian Ocean</text>
  <text start="946.519" dur="5.201">including go to crude buyers in Asia</text>
  <text start="949.339" dur="4.6">greatly changing the dynamics of oil</text>
  <text start="951.72" dur="5.64">markets in this part of the world and</text>
  <text start="953.939" dur="9.71">most likely they will not use the dollar</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="8.64">for this whatsoever now we understand</text>
  <text start="963.649" dur="3.711">Obamacare is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="966" dur="3.04">they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="967.36" dur="3.65">very rough time keeping this system</text>
  <text start="969.04" dur="5.7">afloat and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="971.01" dur="5.769">exchanges fold and another one is most</text>
  <text start="974.74" dur="4.26">likely on its way out is Rhode Island</text>
  <text start="976.779" dur="5.49">their limping along they need a lot more</text>
  <text start="979" dur="4.29">funding to keep alive here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="982.269" dur="2.401">going to have to watch that one very</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="4.47">carefully because it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="984.67" dur="8.31">the next one that is going down now the</text>
  <text start="987.76" dur="9.63">TPP the full text of the trans-pacific</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="7.28">partnership was released and we know why</text>
  <text start="997.39" dur="4.92">because right now Obama&amp;#39;s ready to sign</text>
  <text start="1000.26" dur="5.199">Congress is going to have to review it</text>
  <text start="1002.31" dur="6">in the next 90 days and as they opened</text>
  <text start="1005.459" dur="5.011">it up it is not for the people</text>
  <text start="1008.31" dur="4.74">whatsoever actually it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="1010.47" dur="5.79">worse as time goes on and more you read</text>
  <text start="1013.05" dur="6.2">it is definitely a terrible terrible</text>
  <text start="1016.26" dur="9.689">thing and one of the big things here is</text>
  <text start="1019.25" dur="10.27">the TPP allows us and foreign companies</text>
  <text start="1025.949" dur="7.26">to horror to hire foreign professionals</text>
  <text start="1029.52" dur="6.87">and technicians to take skilled jobs in</text>
  <text start="1033.209" dur="7.801">the United States so what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="8.97">is they&amp;#39;re going to bring in the workers</text>
  <text start="1041.01" dur="6.809">from countries like Vietnam Malaysia and</text>
  <text start="1045.36" dur="5.55">others they will bring them here to the</text>
  <text start="1047.819" dur="6.091">United States and they will only have to</text>
  <text start="1050.91" dur="6.98">pay them what they get paid in their</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="7.2">countries think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1057.89" dur="6.82">what does that do to an American who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1061.11" dur="6.809">competing for the same job it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="1064.71" dur="5.01">you lower your hourly wage to whatever</text>
  <text start="1067.919" dur="6.031">they&amp;#39;re getting paid in their country or</text>
  <text start="1069.72" dur="10.32">you just don&amp;#39;t have a job and this is</text>
  <text start="1073.95" dur="10.8">going to be a major major problem I mean</text>
  <text start="1080.04" dur="9.12">this TPP contract that Obama&amp;#39;s all ready</text>
  <text start="1084.75" dur="6.99">to sign is going to open our entire</text>
  <text start="1089.16" dur="4.59">service industry to companies and their</text>
  <text start="1091.74" dur="8.1">employees from all of these partner</text>
  <text start="1093.75" dur="7.23">countries now when we look at this this</text>
  <text start="1099.84" dur="2.82">tells me</text>
  <text start="1100.98" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s a reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1102.66" dur="5.759">and it&amp;#39;s the same reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1104.4" dur="7.649">bringing in the illegal immigrants is</text>
  <text start="1108.419" dur="6.961">because they think this will help keep</text>
  <text start="1112.049" dur="5.37">the system going second of all they know</text>
  <text start="1115.38" dur="3.9">the economy is dying and they know</text>
  <text start="1117.419" dur="5.941">eventually the US will not be the</text>
  <text start="1119.28" dur="7.35">reserve currency and they will fight to</text>
  <text start="1123.36" dur="6.15">keep it but eventually this will be a</text>
  <text start="1126.63" dur="5.31">third world country and I believe bill</text>
  <text start="1129.51" dur="5.61">halter didn&amp;#39;t mention this in our</text>
  <text start="1131.94" dur="8.1">interview on The X 22 report spotlight</text>
  <text start="1135.12" dur="8.4">and as a third world country they need</text>
  <text start="1140.04" dur="6.87">to bring the wages down to that level</text>
  <text start="1143.52" dur="6.63">and it seems like with this this is what</text>
  <text start="1146.91" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re going to be doing and this is</text>
  <text start="1150.15" dur="5.46">going to be a complete disaster for many</text>
  <text start="1153.75" dur="3.12">of the people here in your app probably</text>
  <text start="1155.61" dur="4.62">all the people here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1156.87" dur="8.34">because our way of life is coming to an</text>
  <text start="1160.23" dur="8.22">end now another part of the TPP is</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="8.99">saying that they&amp;#39;re looking to change</text>
  <text start="1168.45" dur="9.21">the immigration laws and of course Obama</text>
  <text start="1174.2" dur="5.109">saying no no the TPP is not going to</text>
  <text start="1177.66" dur="4.649">change immigration laws whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1179.309" dur="7.231">nothing is nothing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1182.309" dur="6.451">there but the TPP&amp;#39;s forced rewrite of</text>
  <text start="1186.54" dur="4.68">the nation immigration laws comes at the</text>
  <text start="1188.76" dur="5.76">back end of the TPP process not the</text>
  <text start="1191.22" dur="6.36">front then the TPP is opening up of the</text>
  <text start="1194.52" dur="5.13">US service sector is critical it means</text>
  <text start="1197.58" dur="4.469">companies will have an incentive to</text>
  <text start="1199.65" dur="4.59">maximize their use of existing rules</text>
  <text start="1202.049" dur="4.951">that allow them to bring in an unlimited</text>
  <text start="1204.24" dur="4.439">number of foreign workers dubbed guest</text>
  <text start="1207" dur="4.53">workers into United States for example</text>
  <text start="1208.679" dur="5.521">if GE can make the argument that a</text>
  <text start="1211.53" dur="3.81">particular foreign mechanic serving a</text>
  <text start="1214.2" dur="2.82">particular kind of machine has</text>
  <text start="1215.34" dur="3.39">specialized knowledge and that person</text>
  <text start="1217.02" dur="4.74">can be brought over from Malaysia and</text>
  <text start="1218.73" dur="6.87">paid the wages that he was being paid or</text>
  <text start="1221.76" dur="6">she was being paid in that country even</text>
  <text start="1225.6" dur="3.72">if the immigrant even if the migrant</text>
  <text start="1227.76" dur="4.74">foreign workers are paid American wage</text>
  <text start="1229.32" dur="5.61">levels the huge influx of foreign</text>
  <text start="1232.5" dur="5.07">workers will flood the US market</text>
  <text start="1234.93" dur="5.82">and drive down wages paid to american</text>
  <text start="1237.57" dur="5.64">technicians and professionals and it</text>
  <text start="1240.75" dur="5.52">will allow more and more of these people</text>
  <text start="1243.21" dur="6.93">into the country so you can see their</text>
  <text start="1246.27" dur="5.91">plan right now their plan is to bring us</text>
  <text start="1250.14" dur="4.41">to a third world country this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1252.18" dur="5.61">happening right now the Electronic</text>
  <text start="1254.55" dur="7.8">Frontier Foundation concluded on its</text>
