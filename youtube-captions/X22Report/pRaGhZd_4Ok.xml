  <text start="340.259" dur="5.621">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and we know</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="4.41">what it is the government once again</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="4.58">their statistical information it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="9.27">complete lie their numbers are</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="10.59">completely meaningless so last year was</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="8.4">a better year with higher unemployment</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="7.51">and the year before that was even better</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="8.19">so this tells us the real unemployment</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="8.46">is actually increasing and now we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="5.01">an all-time high many people put the</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="3.449">unemployment rate around thirty percent</text>
  <text start="379" dur="3.9">now there&amp;#39;s all different calculations</text>
  <text start="380.469" dur="6.181">that they use some say it&amp;#39;s 22% some say</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="6.359">twenty-five percent and we can see right</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="6.48">now the government continually</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="6.541">manipulates all these numbers right now</text>
  <text start="393.13" dur="5.43">Macy&amp;#39;s has also slashed its full-year</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="5.179">same-store guidance down from a flat</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="6.69">negative one-point-eight percent stu-</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="6.671">2.2% with sales projected to drop</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.37">negative two point seven negative two</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="6.87">point seven percent to negative</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="6.76">three-point-one percent and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="6.78">saying is that the US consumer is bad</text>
  <text start="416.38" dur="6.3">and it is getting worse by the day now</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="3.57">of course they can&amp;#39;t blame this on the</text>
  <text start="422.68" dur="5.789">weather because there&amp;#39;s no snow can they</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="5.76">say it&amp;#39;s too warm out maybe but it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="428.469" dur="3.871">leading back to the same thing</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="6.21">and guess what that is it&amp;#39;s the economy</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s an illusion and now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="436.84" dur="6.03">the cracks in the government numbers</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="5.61">they don&amp;#39;t make any sense and once we go</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="5.31">through this holiday season guess what</text>
  <text start="445.54" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s just gonna get worse and their</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="4.68">statistical numbers will make no sense</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="4.47">whatsoever people will look at it and go</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="4.14">ah that&amp;#39;s not even what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="455.23" dur="4.95">happening here because I lost my job and</text>
  <text start="457" dur="5.34">I can&amp;#39;t find a new one holiday sales are</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="5.16">down all the stories that I once knew</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="4.68">are closing people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="6.65">left and right and we&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="467.02" dur="8.64">seeing layoffs now we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="5.38">the US consumers are not spending and</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="4.62">out of Bank of America&amp;#39;s latest credit</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="6.63">and debit card usage data we can see</text>
  <text start="480.28" dur="8.09">there are 10 us metro areas where guess</text>
  <text start="484" dur="7.14">what retail sales have completely</text>
  <text start="488.37" dur="7.26">imploded on itself we&amp;#39;re looking at Los</text>

  <text start="495.63" dur="9.85">Atlanta San Francisco just above zero</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="7.59">percent we&amp;#39;re starting to see it take</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="5.46">its toll and everyone says well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="6">great over here in this city guess what</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="7.5">it spreads people what do you think</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="7.26">happened in 2008 do you think every city</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="7.32">every town every state at the exact same</text>
  <text start="521.65" dur="6.36">time imploded no it happened in</text>
  <text start="525.76" dur="3.51">different areas first now people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="2.94">want to believe it was happening and</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="4.95">then it&amp;#39;s spread to another city and</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="7.77">another city it&amp;#39;s a domino effect this</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="7.32">is what we are seeing right now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="5.49">same thing with real estate the same</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.64">thing with retail the same thing with</text>
  <text start="544.21" dur="6.3">jobs it hits different areas first and</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="5.13">then it spreads up to your area where</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="3.54">once you are like whoa everything is</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="6.42">fine here the next morning you wake up</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="6.69">what just happened so it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="4.47">cities that we&amp;#39;re seeing this where</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="3.36">consumers can&amp;#39;t go out and pay for these</text>
  <text start="563.2" dur="3.24">goods we</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="4.65">are seeing this in states like Texas is</text>
  <text start="566.44" dur="5.009">a complete disaster they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="7.829">recession right now because of all the</text>
  <text start="571.449" dur="7.291">jobs they lost in the energy sector US</text>
  <text start="576.579" dur="7.101">consumers right now are running on fumes</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="8.099">if we look at supermarkets restaurants</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="5.32">we&amp;#39;re seeing that sales in supermarkets</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="6.511">and restaurants they are falling right</text>
  <text start="589" dur="6.99">now so what does this tell us this is an</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="6.51">indicator of how the upper middle class</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="7.49">is faring the downward inflection point</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="6.029">in early 2015 is problematic right now</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="7.419">because this shows us that the high-end</text>
  <text start="605.889" dur="7.32">consumer is now rolling over bottom line</text>
  <text start="610.899" dur="5.641">the sudden weakness and discretionary</text>
  <text start="613.209" dur="6.391">spending is far less about migration to</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="5.4">online sellers as it is about the</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="4.65">ongoing decline in a perch in the</text>
  <text start="621.94" dur="4.17">purchasing ability of the US middle</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="3.48">class and this is what the corporate</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="3.27">media wants you to believe that Oh</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="3.24">everyone is not shopping at the</text>
  <text start="629.38" dur="4.59">brick-and-mortar stores they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="6.57">to online sales but guess what online</text>
  <text start="633.97" dur="5.929">sales are not reflecting this and just</text>
  <text start="637.54" dur="5.099">because we have one company like Amazon</text>
  <text start="639.899" dur="5.05">where people are going to purchase this</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="5.671">doesn&amp;#39;t make up the entire brick and</text>
  <text start="644.949" dur="5.88">mortar system and their sales don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="6.389">reflect what we&amp;#39;re losing in the</text>
  <text start="650.829" dur="7.291">brick-and-mortar arena so that argument</text>
  <text start="654.699" dur="7.171">is completely false just like all the</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="7.38">others they&amp;#39;re trying to use it makes no</text>
  <text start="661.87" dur="8.399">sense now as we go forward here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="9.54">seeing that Obamacare the premiums</text>
  <text start="670.269" dur="8.971">continually are moving up they&amp;#39;re</text>
