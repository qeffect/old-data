  <text start="33.12" dur="5.04">date is August 8th 2014 and the title</text>
  <text start="36.3" dur="3.899">this episode is the central bankers US</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="3.81">government set the stage for the false</text>
  <text start="40.199" dur="4.5">flag event and what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="41.97" dur="6.089">well we know Congress they are on</text>
  <text start="44.699" dur="7.021">vacation President Obama decided that he</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="6.93">was going to conduct an airstrike inside</text>
  <text start="51.72" dur="5.85">Iraq to bring humanitarian aid to the</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="4.051">people because of the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="5.19">we have to back up for a second here the</text>
  <text start="59.04" dur="6.93">Islamic state has been created by the</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="4.95">United States Israel UK and other Arab</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="5.579">nations and private Western Central Bank</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="7.11">nations it was created for this purpose</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="5.701">to create chaos in this region and we</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="4.469">can see already the stage has been set</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="5.13">and what I mean by this is if you go</text>
  <text start="79.289" dur="6.301">back to a couple reports the Islamic</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="7.769">state specifically said if we are</text>
  <text start="85.59" dur="7.879">attacked we will hit the United States</text>
  <text start="90.149" dur="6.57">and its interests all over the world and</text>
  <text start="93.469" dur="4.96">we can see right now this has been</text>
  <text start="96.719" dur="4.44">planned from the beginning so we have</text>
  <text start="98.429" dur="3.961">Congress on vacation Obama decided to do</text>
  <text start="101.159" dur="2.791">something right now which is an</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.5">airstrike on Islamic state and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="5.669">continuing and we&amp;#39;re heading into this</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="4.619">fall of course the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="3.511">exiting these stimulus which is an</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="4.081">illusion they&amp;#39;re just going to be doing</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.099">it in a different way and we realize</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.979">they need to start a war they need some</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="4.231">type of an event and they&amp;#39;re setting the</text>
  <text start="120.569" dur="4.08">stage right now and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="4.409">bring this home here and we can see</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.941">right now it is building this is the</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="6.151">first staged attack now let&amp;#39;s see what</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="6.39">the Islamic state does so we can see and</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="6.87">we know already that the government has</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.48">shipped out bombs all over the world to</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="4.36">different embassies and I report</text>
  <text start="141.46" dur="5.13">this couple reports ago and they are</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="4.59">just now been delivered and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.53">sitting there waiting okay we understand</text>
  <text start="148.84" dur="5.61">that we also understand the borders are</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="6.89">wide open for all these so-called</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="6.15">terrorists which are agents of CIA</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="5.32">government and they have been placed</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="4.68">within the United States they are ready</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="4.5">to go they&amp;#39;re sleeping right now and</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="4.26">when they&amp;#39;re called upon terror will</text>
  <text start="167.83" dur="3.03">strike inside the United States because</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="4.1">we have to remember we have to go back</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="5.43">that there have been lone wolf groups</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="5.11">inside the United States they can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="5.22">track of them and guess what they know</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="4.44">how to make bombs and they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="3.81">new stealth bomb which cannot be</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="4.47">detected so something could have entered</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="4.56">the United States and no one knows about</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="4.86">it so we can see how they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="5.01">this up now this terror attack that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="5.87">going to eventually come because we know</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="5.76">we can see all the indicators now and</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="6.43">all they&amp;#39;re all coming together</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="6.93">basically and we can see that this most</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="5.58">likely will will be in a multi stage</text>
  <text start="207.58" dur="4.38">type of an event I mean we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="4.68">see the Islamic state but they want to</text>
  <text start="211.96" dur="6.38">bring in Russia somehow and we might see</text>
  <text start="215.08" dur="7.56">that Russia said they saw an opportunity</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="6.64">to wage a cyber attack against the power</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="5.13">infrastructure they saw an opportunity</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="5.97">to hit the financial institutions now</text>
  <text start="227.77" dur="5.64">you have to remember Russia really</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t have to do anything like this</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="3.57">whatsoever basically they can get</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="3.6">together with China and the other BRIC</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="5.43">nations and say you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="5.7">start dumping the Treasury bonds and it</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="5.46">would collapse the United States in a</text>
  <text start="244.75" dur="4.83">split second so they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.32">to do any of this stuff but they need to</text>
  <text start="249.58" dur="4.38">bring all this in and they need to make</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="4.02">they need to make sure that we</text>
  <text start="253.96" dur="5.04">understand that Russia was part of it</text>
  <text start="256.21" dur="5.01">China is going to be part of it and we</text>
  <text start="259" dur="4.14">need to get into the Middle East so</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re going to see many different stages</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="7.98">of this as this builds up and Obama</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="8.929">right now is laying the path out now for</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="7.609">the next event we can see him pushing</text>
  <text start="275.129" dur="5.671">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="278.729" dur="3.66">planning all along because we have to</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="4.049">understand the economy is falling apart</text>
  <text start="282.389" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s no way around it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.849" dur="4.59">doing many different things to keep the</text>
  <text start="287.309" dur="2.94">illusion alive but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.439" dur="2.31">going to work</text>
  <text start="290.249" dur="3.27">I think it&amp;#39;s eventually just going to</text>
  <text start="291.749" dur="4.71">collapse around them and they need this</text>
  <text start="293.519" dur="5.7">event to occur before the collapse they</text>
  <text start="296.459" dur="4.74">cannot wait because if the collapse</text>
  <text start="299.219" dur="3.69">occurs and then they have the event it</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="3.601">makes no sense at that point so they</text>
  <text start="302.909" dur="3.69">need something before the collapse</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="3.869">happens and they are definitely running</text>
  <text start="306.599" dur="3.54">out of time here now let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="5.821">economic collapse news now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="7.5">seeing here is the economic The</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="6.659">Economist the government the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="6.99">all talking about you know the US labor</text>
  <text start="321.149" dur="5.79">costs and right now the second quarter</text>
  <text start="324.629" dur="4.89">u.s. labor costs miss after a massive</text>
  <text start="326.939" dur="4.29">one-off spike revision in first quarter</text>
  <text start="329.519" dur="5.04">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now that</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="5.31">there is no wage growth and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="334.559" dur="4.89">right around the corner nothing is</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="5.97">growing at this point wages are not</text>
  <text start="339.449" dur="6.06">increasing everything is declining right</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="5.07">now actually they were expecting a 1%</text>
  <text start="345.509" dur="6.59">rise and what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="347.579" dur="7.531">is 0.6 rise so they completely missed</text>
  <text start="352.099" dur="5.41">right now now what else are we seeing</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="6.059">well a couple reports ago I told you</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="6.27">about how they manipulate GDP and they</text>
  <text start="361.169" dur="5.1">were using inventories to really keep</text>
  <text start="363.779" dur="3.93">the inventories to build up the GDP and</text>
  <text start="366.269" dur="3.36">eventually they were going to have to</text>
  <text start="367.709" dur="3.54">sell off those inventories and this is</text>
  <text start="369.629" dur="3.33">what happened in the first quarter but</text>
  <text start="371.249" dur="4.56">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is hotel</text>
  <text start="372.959" dur="6.06">inventories rose only 0.3 percent in</text>
  <text start="375.809" dur="6.51">June the same pace as in May missing by</text>
  <text start="379.019" dur="5.46">the most since February 2013 with GDP</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="4.5">now basically an exercise in inventory</text>
  <text start="384.479" dur="5.16">expansion and contraction the second</text>
  <text start="386.819" dur="6">quarter inventory estimate amount to 40%</text>
  <text start="389.639" dur="5.52">of GDP this miss offers a little hope</text>
  <text start="392.819" dur="4.77">for the initial second quarter rebound</text>
  <text start="395.159" dur="5.28">to hold its exuberance in addition</text>
  <text start="397.589" dur="5.43">wholesale sales also missed up only</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="5.22">about 0.2 percent against expectations</text>
  <text start="403.019" dur="5.07">of about 0.7 percent with growth slowing</text>
  <text start="405.659" dur="3.441">for the third month in a row the result</text>
  <text start="408.089" dur="4.381">is that the sick</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="7.36">275 billion rise in nominal GDP in the</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="6.33">past year a whopping 52% or over half is</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="4.47">due to nothing else but inventory</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="5.25">hoarding and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="5.07">is that this is going to come to an end</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="5.01">probably the third quarter we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="426" dur="5.48">to see a disaster number in GDP it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="5.49">going to completely collapse on itself</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="5.41">now the Fed did a study and it shows</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="5.52">that 40 percent of the households show</text>
  <text start="436.89" dur="4.65">signs of financial stress 4 out of 10</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="3.45">American households were straining</text>
  <text start="441.54" dur="4.32">financially 5 years after the Great</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="4.71">Recession many struggling with you know</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="4.29">Thai credit education debt retirement</text>
  <text start="448.23" dur="3.6">issues and you have to remember all this</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.56">came about is because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="5.1">lost their jobs they lost their homes 38</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="4.08">percent lost their wealth and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="4.44">been trying to recover since that time</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="4.62">period and 42 percent reported that they</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="5.01">had delayed a major purchase or expense</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="4.59">directly due to the recession 18 percent</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="5.1">put off what they considered to be a</text>
  <text start="468" dur="6.54">major life decision as a result of the</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="4.35">recession back in 2008 61 percent</text>
  <text start="474.54" dur="3.21">reported that they expected their</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="5.1">incomes to stay the same in the next 12</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="5.63">months the most common reasons cited by</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="5.79">renters for renting rather than owning</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="5.32">was they couldn&amp;#39;t come up with the down</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="4.38">payment about 45 percent of the people</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="4.92">said they just don&amp;#39;t make enough right</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="4.8">now and they cannot save the money to</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="6.29">come up with a down payment 29% said</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="7.05">listen my credit is shot I cannot get a</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="4.42">mortgage so we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="502.95" dur="4.32">American people they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.73">tapped out 57 percent reporting using</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="4.59">some or all of their savings in the</text>
  <text start="510.06" dur="3.93">Great Recession and right now a lot of</text>
  <text start="511.86" dur="5.82">these people have no savings and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="6.39">a lot of people and again as time goes</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="5.01">on and people are being laid off in</text>
  <text start="520.38" dur="4.23">these corporations they&amp;#39;re going to dip</text>
  <text start="522.69" dur="4.44">into their savings so the savings rate</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="4.17">is going to continually go down then</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;ll go to their credit cards they</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="3.84">will max those out and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="4.5">continually look for jobs and things</text>
  <text start="532.62" dur="5.49">just will not work out for many many of</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="6.15">the people that are out there and right</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="5.61">now 48% of the people saying if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="5.4">some type of hypothetical emergency</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="4.5">costing about four hundred dollars they</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="5.31">would be able to cover that without</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="5.31">selling anything but 52 percent would</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="5.82">have to sell something to cover that</text>
  <text start="553.53" dur="7.05">$400 expense so that tells you almost</text>
  <text start="557.73" dur="5.87">half of the American people are really</text>
  <text start="560.58" dur="6.27">in bad shape and we have to go back to</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.05">2008 I mean think about B foreclosures</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="4.02">and all the people that have their</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="4.53">credit ruined because of the</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="3.66">foreclosures and not being able to pay</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="3.33">their credit cards because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="5.07">find a job and all those people who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="6.24">accepted another job but are receiving</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="5.13">less now or how to find a part-time job</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="3.66">because there were no full-time jobs out</text>
  <text start="584.73" dur="4.14">there and of course those people who</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="5.37">just couldn&amp;#39;t find a job again now we</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="4.86">understand that most of the people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="5.37">buy housing here in the United States</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="6.45">and this is why the Fed has been using</text>
  <text start="597.15" dur="5.97">free money delivering it to hedge fund</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="5.46">and investment companies to pump up the</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="4.68">market by buying houses in cash either</text>
  <text start="605.64" dur="5.04">holding it or renting it if they can</text>
  <text start="607.8" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re also foreign investors coming in</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="4.95">buying houses in cash and this is why we</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="5.25">see all the major mortgage corporate</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="3.72">companies laying off thousands of</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="3.57">thousands of people a lot of mortgage</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="3.57">companies are closing at this point</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="3.66">because they realize the American people</text>
  <text start="622.92" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re not taking out mortgages and</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="3.87">this is why we see mortgages and</text>
  <text start="626.52" dur="3.81">refinancing continually declining every</text>
  <text start="628.95" dur="4.11">single week and we&amp;#39;re coming out of the</text>
  <text start="630.33" dur="4.98">hot season right now heading into full</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="5.25">and winter where things really start to</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="5.37">slow down dry up and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="638.31" dur="3.93">a nightmare now the Fed US government</text>
  <text start="640.68" dur="3.54">realized that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="3.75">major major problem they see problems in</text>

  <text start="645.99" dur="5.49">worried and they&amp;#39;re coming up with all</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="5.64">these different ways of trying to pump</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="4.53">up the housing market and one of the</text>
  <text start="654" dur="5.01">ways they&amp;#39;re going to do to do it is</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="9.33">they&amp;#39;re going to change the definition</text>
  <text start="659.01" dur="8.79">of the FICO score and of course they use</text>
  <text start="665.34" dur="4.02">this to base mortgages on so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.8" dur="3.09">going to help the people out you know</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="3.45">all those people that have really really</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="3.78">bad credit that I have no money well</text>
  <text start="672.81" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going to make it even easier for</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="3.27">those people to get housing</text>
  <text start="676.2" dur="3.57">and they&amp;#39;re hoping that those people</text>
  <text start="677.94" dur="4.41">come into the market right now a</text>
  <text start="679.77" dur="5.43">shocking 77 million Americans currently</text>
  <text start="682.35" dur="4.68">face debt collectors 77 million</text>
  <text start="685.2" dur="4.62">Americans effectively have zero access</text>

  <text start="689.82" dur="5.9">they no longer are eligible whatsoever</text>
  <text start="693" dur="5.7">so what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;re going to change the definition</text>
  <text start="698.7" dur="5.37">of FICO and do some credit score</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="4.99">recalculations</text>
  <text start="704.07" dur="5.73">on consumers failing to pay a bill if</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="4.02">the bill has been paid or settled with a</text>
  <text start="709.8" dur="4.47">collection agency so what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="711.96" dur="4.56">to do is say you know what we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="4.56">count that in the score and will make</text>
  <text start="716.52" dur="4.38">your score a little bit higher they will</text>
  <text start="718.83" dur="4.41">also give less weight to unpaid medical</text>
  <text start="720.9" dur="4.77">bills that are with a collection agency</text>
  <text start="723.24" dur="5.01">in doing so it will make it easier for</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="5.37">tens of millions of Americans to get</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="4.5">loans as of July about sixty four point</text>

  <text start="747.75" dur="6.27">now they are continually manipulating</text>
  <text start="751.74" dur="4.77">the system because they realize if they</text>

  <text start="780.87" dur="5.04">come before the collapse and they</text>

  <text start="799.71" dur="4.56">wait a minute here we need to really</text>
  <text start="802.26" dur="4.98">protect ourselves so Russia and China</text>
  <text start="804.27" dur="4.89">central banks have agreed to a draft</text>

  <text start="985.23" dur="4.95">our islands we&amp;#39;re placing them there and</text>
  <text start="987.48" dur="5.01">all of this is about provoking and we</text>
  <text start="990.18" dur="5.279">can see right now that Vietnam is making</text>

  <text start="1002" dur="6.06">now and again that is one of the flash</text>

  <text start="1024.65" dur="5.51">right now is completely out of control</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="5.35">now it looks like these so-called</text>
  <text start="1030.16" dur="4.75">sanctions on Russia are really</text>
  <text start="1032.63" dur="5.13">backfiring on Europe and the United</text>
  <text start="1034.91" dur="4.74">States and Russian importers started</text>
  <text start="1037.76" dur="4.59">canceling orders from the EU suppliers</text>
  <text start="1039.65" dur="6.96">this morning they are turning trucks</text>
  <text start="1042.35" dur="6.87">away despite President Obama telling us</text>
  <text start="1046.61" dur="5.85">that Russia is increasingly being</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="4.53">isolated and you know Russia will not be</text>
  <text start="1052.46" dur="2.79">able to survive they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1053.75" dur="3.72">starving their people because of these</text>
  <text start="1055.25" dur="5.25">sanctions and because what they decided</text>
  <text start="1057.47" dur="5.64">to do where they&amp;#39;re not accepting food</text>
  <text start="1060.5" dur="4.86">from the US and the EU and many other</text>
  <text start="1063.11" dur="6.69">countries you know and what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1065.36" dur="7.44">seeing is that no Russia has really</text>
  <text start="1069.8" dur="4.98">moved from importing food from United</text>
  <text start="1072.8" dur="3.54">States and Europe and moved over to the</text>
  <text start="1074.78" dur="4.59">BRIC nations I mean</text>
  <text start="1076.34" dur="4.89">can replace me imports from the US EU</text>

  <text start="1098.57" dur="5.67">can be imported from Argentina Chile</text>
  <text start="1100.52" dur="8.97">China and Serbia so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1104.24" dur="7.5">all this talk about the the how Russia</text>
  <text start="1109.49" dur="4.59">is isolating themselves that this is</text>
  <text start="1111.74" dur="4.289">going to really have a bad effect on</text>
  <text start="1114.08" dur="4.74">them and how it&amp;#39;s gonna their people are</text>
  <text start="1116.029" dur="4.411">going to be starving well again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1118.82" dur="3.089">always the opposite whatever the</text>
  <text start="1120.44" dur="4.2">government officials are saying it is</text>
  <text start="1121.909" dur="4.231">always the opposite and we can see</text>
  <text start="1124.64" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that yes this is</text>
  <text start="1126.14" dur="4.56">hurting Russia but what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1127.909" dur="4.801">seeing it&amp;#39;s hurting the EU it&amp;#39;s hurting</text>
  <text start="1130.7" dur="5.339">the United States think about how much</text>
  <text start="1132.71" dur="5.16">we export and the EU exports out now all</text>
  <text start="1136.039" dur="4.051">of a sudden they just lost that business</text>
  <text start="1137.87" dur="4.08">so these businesses will start hurting</text>
  <text start="1140.09" dur="4.02">once these businesses start hurting what</text>
  <text start="1141.95" dur="3.99">happens oh we don&amp;#39;t need them as many</text>
  <text start="1144.11" dur="4.169">people so they start laying off people</text>
  <text start="1145.94" dur="5.76">now there&amp;#39;s more people out of work this</text>
  <text start="1148.279" dur="9.061">will only hurt the European Union and</text>
  <text start="1151.7" dur="9.599">the United States now Russia is looking</text>
  <text start="1157.34" dur="6.15">to pretty much get all their aerospace</text>
  <text start="1161.299" dur="4.471">components from China now right now they</text>
  <text start="1163.49" dur="4.53">do not get their aerospace components</text>
  <text start="1165.77" dur="4.68">from China but what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="1168.02" dur="4.86">again they&amp;#39;re pretty much separating</text>
  <text start="1170.45" dur="4.859">themselves from the Western Bank</text>
  <text start="1172.88" dur="4.32">countries they realize war is coming</text>
  <text start="1175.309" dur="4.261">they can&amp;#39;t be dependent on anything</text>
  <text start="1177.2" dur="4.62">outside they need to be dependent on</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="2.729">themselves and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1181.82" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1182.299" dur="4.11">Russian aerospace and military</text>
  <text start="1184.52" dur="4.23">industrial enterprises will purchase</text>

  <text start="1208.97" dur="3.539">the United States</text>
  <text start="1209.809" dur="6.48">so it looks like they are moving forward</text>
  <text start="1212.509" dur="6.09">and saying okay we have these sanctions</text>
  <text start="1216.289" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ll just turn in a different direction</text>
  <text start="1218.599" dur="4.981">and of course these countries where</text>
  <text start="1220.969" dur="5.31">Russia is purchasing from they will see</text>
  <text start="1223.58" dur="5.189">a rise in their economy and guess what</text>
  <text start="1226.279" dur="4.76">to purchase all these goods they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1228.769" dur="5.311">going to use the US dollar</text>

  <text start="1270.559" dur="3.87">saying oh yeah we&amp;#39;re going to be placing</text>
  <text start="1272.179" dur="5.67">sanctions on Russia we&amp;#39;re going to put</text>
  <text start="1274.429" dur="6.24">about 172 people on the list and about</text>
  <text start="1277.849" dur="6.03">65 companies which I really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1280.669" dur="5.34">it rat really matters but by placing all</text>
  <text start="1283.879" dur="4.71">these sanctions and doing what Yatsenyuk</text>
  <text start="1286.009" dur="5.49">wants to do Ukraine is going to lose</text>
  <text start="1288.589" dur="5.611">about 7 billion dollars in the first</text>
  <text start="1291.499" dur="5.85">year due to the Russian sanctions that</text>
  <text start="1294.2" dur="5.49">he just placed on Russia again these</text>
  <text start="1297.349" dur="4.65">people don&amp;#39;t care they just want to keep</text>

  <text start="1306.83" dur="4.829">up nope take the country get all the</text>
  <text start="1309.529" dur="5.61">resources you possibly can put them into</text>
  <text start="1311.659" dur="7.02">as much debt as possible and this is the</text>
  <text start="1315.139" dur="6.84">strategy now it looks like the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="1318.679" dur="6.6">with Israel and Gaza has come to an end</text>
  <text start="1321.979" dur="5.28">now what happened was they were having a</text>
  <text start="1325.279" dur="3.45">discussion not really a discussion it</text>
  <text start="1327.259" dur="3.27">was really an ultimatum Israel said</text>
  <text start="1328.729" dur="3.33">listen we&amp;#39;re going to go back to the way</text>
  <text start="1330.529" dur="3.48">it was the borders are going to stay</text>
  <text start="1332.059" dur="4.8">closed we&amp;#39;re gonna have tight sanctions</text>
  <text start="1334.009" dur="5.28">on you the tunnels are destroyed and you</text>
  <text start="1336.859" dur="4.23">need to give us all your weapons what</text>
  <text start="1339.289" dur="3.6">you don&amp;#39;t agree and Hamas said</text>
  <text start="1341.089" dur="2.371">absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not going back to</text>
  <text start="1342.889" dur="3.091">that</text>
  <text start="1343.46" dur="4.8">and they decided that the ceasefire is</text>
  <text start="1345.98" dur="4.23">over but it of course and no corporate</text>
  <text start="1348.26" dur="4.62">media and everywhere else it makes it</text>
  <text start="1350.21" dur="4.74">look like Hamas just started firing but</text>
  <text start="1352.88" dur="3.84">no that&amp;#39;s not how it was it you can</text>
  <text start="1354.95" dur="3.57">compare this to the Ukraine when</text>
  <text start="1356.72" dur="4.41">poroshenko says okay we have a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="1358.52" dur="5">and here&amp;#39;s the ceasefire lay down your</text>
  <text start="1361.13" dur="5.1">weapons put your hands up in the air</text>
  <text start="1363.52" dur="4.66">surrender we will then put you in jail</text>
  <text start="1366.23" dur="3.72">and we&amp;#39;ll take over the southeastern</text>
  <text start="1368.18" dur="5.07">section this is what Israel is basically</text>
  <text start="1369.95" dur="5.97">saying to the people in Gaza now Israel</text>
  <text start="1373.25" dur="5.19">is very nervous because they are being</text>
  <text start="1375.92" dur="6.45">brought up on war crimes by the</text>
  <text start="1378.44" dur="7.04">Palestinians and Netanyahu wants members</text>
  <text start="1382.37" dur="7.92">of US Congress on Wednesday to help him</text>
  <text start="1385.48" dur="6.94">with the International Criminal Court he</text>
  <text start="1390.29" dur="3.9">wants of course the United States there</text>
  <text start="1392.42" dur="5.37">to veto anything that&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1394.19" dur="6.36">and he want him to help them out so they</text>
  <text start="1397.79" dur="4.47">must be very very nervous because a lot</text>
  <text start="1400.55" dur="3.87">of the world opinion is looking at the</text>
  <text start="1402.26" dur="4.32">situation and saying you know what you</text>
  <text start="1404.42" dur="4.17">went in there you killed the</text>
  <text start="1406.58" dur="3.93">infrastructure we never saw any weapons</text>
  <text start="1408.59" dur="3.66">whatsoever it on this sounds like the</text>
  <text start="1410.51" dur="3">United States during the first Iraq</text>
  <text start="1412.25" dur="3.3">invasion where they said there was</text>
  <text start="1413.51" dur="4.44">weapons of mass destruction and there</text>
  <text start="1415.55" dur="4.32">was nothing there well we saw pictures</text>
  <text start="1417.95" dur="4.8">of all the buildings they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1419.87" dur="4.8">showed any weapons there whatsoever that</text>
  <text start="1422.75" dur="3.15">and this is why they had a built that</text>
  <text start="1424.67" dur="2.94">this is why they had to destroy the</text>
  <text start="1425.9" dur="3.75">infrastructure they were killing</text>
  <text start="1427.61" dur="4.71">children for absolutely no reason and I</text>
  <text start="1429.65" dur="4.82">heard a lot of the corporate media out</text>
  <text start="1432.32" dur="3.96">there saying well if these children are</text>
  <text start="1434.47" dur="3.67">related to those parents who are</text>
  <text start="1436.28" dur="3.92">terrorists then they have to be killed</text>
  <text start="1438.14" dur="6.3">well that is absolutely ridiculous for</text>
  <text start="1440.2" dur="6.04">example your children if you decide to</text>
  <text start="1444.44" dur="7.31">commit a crime do your children go to</text>
  <text start="1446.24" dur="8.55">jail no if your parents kill someone and</text>
  <text start="1451.75" dur="6.67">they&amp;#39;re on death row do you as a child</text>
  <text start="1454.79" dur="7.11">go on death row no their mentality is</text>
  <text start="1458.42" dur="6">completely off they killed innocent</text>
  <text start="1461.9" dur="5.76">people and the world is looking at this</text>
  <text start="1464.42" dur="5.91">and saying why did you do this and why</text>
  <text start="1467.66" dur="5.43">did you have to destroy everything in</text>
  <text start="1470.33" dur="4.98">Gaza what was the purpose and why were</text>
  <text start="1473.09" dur="4.17">you killing women and children</text>
  <text start="1475.31" dur="5.31">why were you aim</text>
  <text start="1477.26" dur="5.24">at ambulances hospitals and right now</text>
  <text start="1480.62" dur="5.07">there is absolutely no proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1482.5" dur="6.429">that there were weapons in any of these</text>
  <text start="1485.69" dur="5.01">buildings so right now the United</text>
  <text start="1488.929" dur="4.701">Nations has upgraded the status of</text>
  <text start="1490.7" dur="5.58">Palestine to almost the state level and</text>
  <text start="1493.63" dur="5.02">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that Palestine</text>
  <text start="1496.28" dur="5.34">would be able to apply for membership of</text>
  <text start="1498.65" dur="6.21">the International Court and also be able</text>
  <text start="1501.62" dur="4.89">to pursue human rights charges and war</text>
  <text start="1504.86" dur="3.15">crimes against Israel now of course</text>
  <text start="1506.51" dur="4.169">United States is going to step in and</text>
  <text start="1508.01" dur="5.7">veto and try to stop this as best they</text>
  <text start="1510.679" dur="5.461">possibly can because again Israel pays</text>
  <text start="1513.71" dur="5.969">all these government officials quite a</text>
  <text start="1516.14" dur="6.36">bit of money for their campaigns now a</text>
  <text start="1519.679" dur="5.401">couple days ago reported on how Marie</text>
  <text start="1522.5" dur="5.13">harf was and she&amp;#39;s the US State</text>
  <text start="1525.08" dur="4.11">Department deputy spokesperson was out</text>
  <text start="1527.63" dur="5.22">there reporting and she kind of slipped</text>
  <text start="1529.19" dur="6.6">up and said the Ebola attack and right</text>
  <text start="1532.85" dur="5.31">now her comments were that there was an</text>
  <text start="1535.79" dur="4.769">Ebola attack and there were comments</text>
  <text start="1538.16" dur="4.92">that were raised and concerns that a</text>
  <text start="1540.559" dur="4.851">weaponized form of the virus may have</text>
  <text start="1543.08" dur="5.88">been used by a rogue terrorist</text>
  <text start="1545.41" dur="6.1">organization in Africa so we can see</text>
  <text start="1548.96" dur="5.19">this is starting to build up now there</text>
  <text start="1551.51" dur="6.11">is also experts from Russia and UK</text>
  <text start="1554.15" dur="5.55">saying yes the Ebola virus can be</text>
  <text start="1557.62" dur="4.96">weaponized and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1559.7" dur="5.01">about this the bioweapon would have no</text>
  <text start="1562.58" dur="5.099">signature compared to like a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1564.71" dur="5.82">weapon or a dude in a dirty nuke because</text>
  <text start="1567.679" dur="5.461">you can track those isotopes down a bio</text>
  <text start="1570.53" dur="5.279">weapon is very different this could be</text>
  <text start="1573.14" dur="5.159">created in a small lab and it could be</text>
  <text start="1575.809" dur="6.301">used than enemy very very hard to track</text>
  <text start="1578.299" dur="6.75">and biological weapons are nothing like</text>
  <text start="1582.11" dur="5.55">nuclear bombs in order to make a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1585.049" dur="5.161">bomb one would require uranium a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1587.66" dur="4.56">bomb plant and so on but a biological</text>
  <text start="1590.21" dur="6.51">weapons are made in a small laboratory</text>
  <text start="1592.22" dur="6.75">which can be easily camouflaged and one</text>
  <text start="1596.72" dur="4.35">of the Russian scientists are saying</text>
  <text start="1598.97" dur="5.97">that I&amp;#39;m concerned about the prevalence</text>
  <text start="1601.07" dur="6.57">and pathogenicity of the situation which</text>
  <text start="1604.94" dur="4.77">is too much even for Ebola too many</text>
  <text start="1607.64" dur="3.119">people are dying I don&amp;#39;t rule out that</text>
  <text start="1609.71" dur="3.629">there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1610.759" dur="4.98">artificial here what is happening with</text>
  <text start="1613.339" dur="5.61">Ebola there could be also be something</text>
  <text start="1615.739" dur="5.9">man-made about it and let me just say we</text>
  <text start="1618.949" dur="5.58">understand first of all that there was</text>
  <text start="1621.639" dur="5.76">Tulane University and other US</text>
  <text start="1624.529" dur="6.12">government agencies down in Africa</text>
  <text start="1627.399" dur="6.73">experimenting with Ebola we see that CDC</text>
  <text start="1630.649" dur="5.82">has a patent on this and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1634.129" dur="6.63">if you&amp;#39;re creating a vaccine for a</text>
  <text start="1636.469" dur="6.84">certain strain of Ebola the vaccine has</text>
  <text start="1640.759" dur="6.36">to work with that strain so all of this</text>
  <text start="1643.309" dur="5.97">is starting to really come out now that</text>
  <text start="1647.119" dur="4.44">this could have been manufactured now we</text>
  <text start="1649.279" dur="5.37">kind of believe this from the past here</text>
  <text start="1651.559" dur="4.89">that yes it seems like something is</text>
  <text start="1654.649" dur="3.84">happening and they&amp;#39;re pushing this type</text>
  <text start="1656.449" dur="4.92">of agenda forward and of course we had</text>
  <text start="1658.489" dur="6.57">information that Boko Haram wanted to</text>
  <text start="1661.369" dur="6.39">create a dirty Ebola bomb and right now</text>
  <text start="1665.059" dur="4.59">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the United</text>
  <text start="1667.759" dur="3.9">States the president is saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1669.649" dur="4.71">not very concerned it can be controlled</text>
  <text start="1671.659" dur="5.07">and like I say always think the opposite</text>
  <text start="1674.359" dur="4.2">and the opposite is that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1676.729" dur="3.84">to spread this across the country and</text>
  <text start="1678.559" dur="4.381">this is why they they have the borders</text>
  <text start="1680.569" dur="4.621">open right now and they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="1682.94" dur="3.629">checking that many people because a lot</text>
  <text start="1685.19" dur="3.779">of people coming in who already have the</text>
  <text start="1686.569" dur="5.371">symptoms won&amp;#39;t even know it until much</text>
  <text start="1688.969" dur="4.86">later and by that time it will be too</text>
  <text start="1691.94" dur="6.589">late and I believe this is what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1693.829" dur="8.03">on right now now it looks like Obama has</text>
  <text start="1698.529" dur="6.67">pretty much ordered the military</text>
  <text start="1701.859" dur="5.081">airstrikes in Iraq to hit the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1705.199" dur="3.84">state now they&amp;#39;re not trying to destroy</text>
  <text start="1706.94" dur="4.049">the Islamic state they just want to hit</text>
  <text start="1709.039" dur="4.62">him a couple times to make it look good</text>
  <text start="1710.989" dur="5.01">so when the Islamic state creates the</text>
  <text start="1713.659" dur="4.71">false flag event we know who the enemy</text>
  <text start="1715.999" dur="5.49">is and where we need to go and this is</text>
  <text start="1718.369" dur="5.31">the first stage of this and right now it</text>
  <text start="1721.489" dur="5.07">seems like the second round of bombings</text>
  <text start="1723.679" dur="5.94">have occurred on a target northwest of</text>
  <text start="1726.559" dur="5.87">Erbil in Iraq and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1729.619" dur="6.72">this is really starting to move forward</text>
  <text start="1732.429" dur="6.04">now of course France is behind this and</text>
  <text start="1736.339" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re saying yes we&amp;#39;re all for it</text>
  <text start="1738.469" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s go after Iraq and we will do our</text>
  <text start="1741.319" dur="3.151">part well of course they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="1743.539" dur="3.601">and they were</text>
  <text start="1744.47" dur="4.949">the first ones out there last year when</text>
  <text start="1747.14" dur="4.86">we have the false flag chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1749.419" dur="4.201">attack in Syria they were the first ones</text>
  <text start="1752" dur="4.169">out there because their economy is</text>
  <text start="1753.62" dur="3.96">collapsing all these nations in the</text>
  <text start="1756.169" dur="4.291">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="1757.58" dur="5.55">are ready for this to happen because</text>
  <text start="1760.46" dur="5.31">their countries are collapsing and</text>
  <text start="1763.13" dur="6.39">there&amp;#39;s no way to stop it right now the</text>
  <text start="1765.77" dur="6.48">FFA the FAA bans all US flights over</text>
  <text start="1769.52" dur="5.93">potentially hazardous iraq airspace and</text>
  <text start="1772.25" dur="6.21">this is going to be in effect until</text>
  <text start="1775.45" dur="5.56">december 31st of 2014</text>
  <text start="1778.46" dur="6.48">how interesting how why would they pick</text>
  <text start="1781.01" dur="9.81">that date because what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="1784.94" dur="8.07">is the the stage has been set the</text>
  <text start="1790.82" dur="4.89">Islamic state now it&amp;#39;s all over the news</text>
  <text start="1793.01" dur="6.12">that the Islamic state is looking to get</text>
  <text start="1795.71" dur="6.48">back at the United States and of course</text>
  <text start="1799.13" dur="5.25">a congressman Adam Kissinger is out</text>
  <text start="1802.19" dur="4.41">there saying that this is ridiculous</text>

  <text start="1809.48" dur="4.199">few bombs but this is not what they want</text>

  <text start="1877.55" dur="4.35">you know innocent people who are just</text>
  <text start="1879.68" dur="5.49">playing on the beach we&amp;#39;re sitting in a</text>
  <text start="1881.9" dur="5.22">school and they&amp;#39;re being killed but here</text>
  <text start="1885.17" dur="3.48">in Iraq where the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1887.12" dur="3.78">because this is their mission this is</text>
  <text start="1888.65" dur="3.81">their agenda this is why all the focus</text>
  <text start="1890.9" dur="5.07">is placed here now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1892.46" dur="7.92">interesting is that while the airstrikes</text>
  <text start="1895.97" dur="8.49">are happening this ceasefire was pretty</text>
  <text start="1900.38" dur="7.08">much done is it a coincidence that had</text>
  <text start="1904.46" dur="6.21">happened at the same exact time no this</text>
  <text start="1907.46" dur="4.95">was planned all of this has been planned</text>
  <text start="1910.67" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t you realize every time something</text>
  <text start="1912.41" dur="7.56">like this happens it is a specific plan</text>
  <text start="1915.65" dur="7.02">it is not coincidence now of course the</text>
  <text start="1919.97" dur="6.78">bombing inside Iraq is running against</text>
  <text start="1922.67" dur="6.42">the United States the American people</text>
  <text start="1926.75" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s very unpopular people are like we</text>
  <text start="1929.09" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t need to go back to Iraq we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1931.01" dur="4.5">need to be bombing inside Iraq we really</text>
  <text start="1933.59" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t need to be there and right now</text>
  <text start="1935.51" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s very unpopular among Americans they</text>
  <text start="1938.78" dur="7.35">want the war in Iraq to be finished not</text>
  <text start="1941.57" dur="8.04">started again now Isis demands American</text>
  <text start="1946.13" dur="7.32">blood and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="1949.61" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re calling an all-out attack on US</text>
  <text start="1953.45" dur="5.1">interests worldwide now I said this in</text>
  <text start="1955.82" dur="8.52">the beginning of the report if we go</text>
  <text start="1958.55" dur="7.14">back when I reported on that explosives</text>
  <text start="1964.34" dur="4.08">were being delivered to all the</text>
  <text start="1965.69" dur="5.4">different embassies within the world the</text>
  <text start="1968.42" dur="4.82">Islamic Islamic state said if we are</text>
  <text start="1971.09" dur="5.13">attacked we will take this out on</text>
  <text start="1973.24" dur="5.02">American interests and then we will move</text>
  <text start="1976.22" dur="4.2">to the people inside the United States</text>
  <text start="1978.26" dur="4.47">so we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="1980.42" dur="5.13">completely a setup I mean if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1982.73" dur="6.06">playing it out perfectly they&amp;#39;re all and</text>
  <text start="1985.55" dur="5.82">Isis the Islamic state is also saying</text>
  <text start="1988.79" dur="5.52">that they will raise the flag of Allah</text>
  <text start="1991.37" dur="5.28">in the White House that they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1994.31" dur="4.17">after the White House now we had</text>
  <text start="1996.65" dur="3.93">information before and this is about</text>
  <text start="1998.48" dur="4.5">North Korea who is going to hit the</text>
  <text start="2000.58" dur="4.74">White House with a nuclear bomb and now</text>
  <text start="2002.98" dur="3.99">we have the Islamic state saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2005.32" dur="3.75">coming for the White House now we can</text>
  <text start="2006.97" dur="4.32">see right now that all of this has been</text>
  <text start="2009.07" dur="5.28">planned</text>
  <text start="2011.29" dur="5.7">this has been part of the overall plan</text>
  <text start="2014.35" dur="5.16">to cover up this economic collapse now</text>
  <text start="2016.99" dur="4.17">this is going like might occur in many</text>
  <text start="2019.51" dur="4.11">many different stages like I said before</text>
  <text start="2021.16" dur="4.17">and we really need to be prepared I mean</text>
  <text start="2023.62" dur="3.72">let&amp;#39;s step back and take a look at</text>
  <text start="2025.33" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s been happening here now we have</text>
  <text start="2027.34" dur="7.98">the the Islamic state in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="2030.58" dur="8.07">causing complete chaos we have the US</text>
  <text start="2035.32" dur="5.34">forces in Africa where China is and many</text>
  <text start="2038.65" dur="4.8">different war skirmishes going on there</text>
  <text start="2040.66" dur="6.24">we have Ukraine completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="2043.45" dur="5.719">we have Libya right now taking back its</text>
  <text start="2046.9" dur="4.62">country Lebanon doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="2049.169" dur="4.091">Yemen doing the same thing so the</text>
  <text start="2051.52" dur="4.08">central bankers are completely losing</text>
  <text start="2053.26" dur="4.05">control in the Middle East and we have</text>
  <text start="2055.6" dur="5.94">other flash points going on around the</text>
  <text start="2057.31" dur="7.56">world we also have our borders wide open</text>
  <text start="2061.54" dur="5.67">with illegals coming in so-called lone</text>
  <text start="2064.87" dur="4.86">wolf groups who can make bombs we have</text>
  <text start="2067.21" dur="6.39">drug dealers coming in criminals coming</text>
  <text start="2069.73" dur="5.4">in and again people from Africa or</text>
  <text start="2073.6" dur="3.96">anyone that&amp;#39;s infected with Ebola</text>
  <text start="2075.13" dur="4.62">chemical can come across the border and</text>
  <text start="2077.56" dur="4.98">no one will be the wiser they get a</text>
  <text start="2079.75" dur="4.98">court date you know in 2020 they set</text>
  <text start="2082.54" dur="4.53">them up in a huge area where other</text>
  <text start="2084.73" dur="5.04">illegals are they all get affected then</text>
  <text start="2087.07" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re released into 23 cities across</text>
  <text start="2089.77" dur="3.51">the United States which completely</text>
  <text start="2091.15" dur="4.56">matches up with all the quarantine</text>
  <text start="2093.28" dur="4.95">centers which I reported on before so</text>
  <text start="2095.71" dur="5.82">you can see how all of this is fitting</text>
  <text start="2098.23" dur="7.62">together right now and now we have Obama</text>
  <text start="2101.53" dur="6.9">using airstrikes in Iraq doing exactly</text>
  <text start="2105.85" dur="4.32">what they were going to do to create an</text>
  <text start="2108.43" dur="5.73">event where the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="2110.17" dur="6.27">already said they will retaliate one way</text>
  <text start="2114.16" dur="4.92">or another so we can see how all this is</text>
  <text start="2116.44" dur="4.89">coming coming down the road here and</text>
  <text start="2119.08" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to that</text>
  <text start="2121.33" dur="6.39">full date where the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="2123.91" dur="5.28">out of the stimulus deal here and of</text>
  <text start="2127.72" dur="3.54">course they&amp;#39;re just maneuvering funds so</text>
  <text start="2129.19" dur="4.02">many different areas and we can see</text>
  <text start="2131.26" dur="3.3">right now that the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="2133.21" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re doing everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="2134.56" dur="4.71">can to manipulate and to keep this thing</text>
  <text start="2137.05" dur="4.23">going but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="2139.27" dur="5.37">the numbers they&amp;#39;re illusionary numbers</text>
  <text start="2141.28" dur="5.13">are moving and separating itself</text>
  <text start="2144.64" dur="3.75">the real economy and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2146.41" dur="3.81">more layoffs coming we know real estate</text>
  <text start="2148.39" dur="3.93">is heading into the fall winter and they</text>
  <text start="2150.22" dur="5.3">know this 2 and this will be collapsing</text>
  <text start="2152.32" dur="6.81">so everyone really needs to start</text>
  <text start="2155.52" dur="6.19">prepping right now I mean really ramping</text>
  <text start="2159.13" dur="4.95">it up because I really do believe from</text>
  <text start="2161.71" dur="5.04">all these indicators right now that we</text>
  <text start="2164.08" dur="5.37">are heading down a path where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2166.75" dur="3.81">going to be hitting a very very big</text>
  <text start="2169.45" dur="2.88">event and you have to remember all our</text>
  <text start="2170.56" dur="5.04">government officials have been telling</text>
  <text start="2172.33" dur="5.37">us that with the Islamic state the next</text>
  <text start="2175.6" dur="4.65">event is going to be a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="2177.7" dur="5.07">9/11 and we already know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2180.25" dur="4.79">implicating Russia in with a digital</text>
  <text start="2182.77" dur="4.8">bomb in the financial institution and a</text>
  <text start="2185.04" dur="5.08">secret malware in the power</text>
  <text start="2187.57" dur="4.62">infrastructure so we can see all this</text>
  <text start="2190.12" dur="4.35">coming down the line and everyone needs</text>
  <text start="2192.19" dur="4.47">to really start getting prepared because</text>
  <text start="2194.47" dur="4.59">you don&amp;#39;t want to be left out especially</text>
  <text start="2196.66" dur="5.04">if there is some type of martial law</text>
  <text start="2199.06" dur="4.41">because of Ebola that&amp;#39;d be step one once</text>
  <text start="2201.7" dur="4.98">that happens and also the United States</text>
  <text start="2203.47" dur="5.87">is attacked by I mean from with inside</text>
  <text start="2206.68" dur="4.98">with inside the United States and</text>
  <text start="2209.34" dur="4.66">letting everyone know it was the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2211.66" dur="4.53">state or Russia but we could see</text>
  <text start="2214" dur="5.16">different bio weapons going off</text>
  <text start="2216.19" dur="4.86">different dirty nukes going off the</text>
  <text start="2219.16" dur="4.11">power grids coming down so you need to</text>
  <text start="2221.05" dur="4.95">make sure that you have the food the</text>
  <text start="2223.27" dur="5.37">water the supplies because if a bullet</text>
  <text start="2226" dur="4.71">is out there you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="2228.64" dur="4.59">rushing to the supermarkets if the power</text>
  <text start="2230.71" dur="6.14">does go out you want to make sure that</text>
