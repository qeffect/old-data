  <text start="255.82" dur="7.41">iPhone and sales are slowing everywhere</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="6.001">and people right now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="263.23" dur="5.99">spending they&amp;#39;re not spending their</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="8.03">money and we see right now more</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="7.21">information has come out that spending</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="5.74">only moved up by point one percent they</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="6.78">were expecting point two percent but it</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="6.42">was point one percent spending on</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="5.31">durable goods well that completely</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.01">tumbled and it is absolutely often</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s washers dryers the big-ticket</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="7.14">items because people are looking at</text>
  <text start="294.16" dur="3.93">their situation they&amp;#39;re hearing layoffs</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="5.309">in there</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="6.69">companies they&amp;#39;re nervous and there are</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="3.56">people that are being laid off and guess</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="3.9">what they&amp;#39;re saying okay you know what</text>
  <text start="306.449" dur="4.661">we&amp;#39;re not doing these big purchases</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="5.37">right now and it&amp;#39;s showing up in the</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="5.36">market and we see that retail is</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.52">continually contracting at this point</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="5.68">chicago PMI well that has doubled</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="6.15">doubled we had a dead cat bounce and</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="7.35">guess what well that is over it is</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="6.81">declined from 53.6 to 50.4 they were</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="6.24">hoping to get a 52.6 but it just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="7.02">happen and it looks like the large</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="8.52">orders and international demand it is</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="8.4">just not there and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="7.74">we see that things had this dead cat</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="6.779">bounce and now we&amp;#39;re trending downward</text>
  <text start="352" dur="6.449">now the Baltic Dry Index we know during</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="7.231">this time period it is seasonal and it</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="6.061">is climbed to over 700 points but this</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="4.829">is the second day in a row that it has</text>
  <text start="364.51" dur="6.09">come down it&amp;#39;s down seven points it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="6.271">down to 703 and most likely this is</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="4.23">going to continually slide as we go</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="2.94">throughout the summer because I think</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="2.85">what has happened at this point is</text>
  <text start="376" dur="3.96">whatever they were going to produce is</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="5.31">produced at this point no new orders are</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="5.25">coming in and we don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="4.59">material and as more and more layoffs</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.5">come in guess what people aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="3.769">out shopping they&amp;#39;re not buying retail</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="4.01">they&amp;#39;re not buying the big ticket items</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="5.5">factories will not produce and we see</text>
  <text start="393.72" dur="5.23">manufacturing it is in the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.849" dur="5.241">continually declining they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="7.08">to order the raw material and this has a</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="6.28">chain reaction going all the way back</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="7.65">and we see that we&amp;#39;re going down this</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="8.609">path once again now GDP came in for the</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="6.18">first quarter at point five percent the</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="5.551">second quarter they&amp;#39;re predicting right</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="5.1">now at one point eight now they said it</text>
  <text start="422.53" dur="4.8">was going to be three percent then 2.5%</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="3.54">then two-point-three percent now here we</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="3.99">are at one point eight percent now if</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="3.54">you take out the manipulation because</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="2.37">you have to remember</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="3.21">they went back to nineteen twenty-nine</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="4.23">they added in research and development</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="4.56">and other things they recalculated GDP</text>
  <text start="437.92" dur="3.54">all the way up to the present day to get</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="4.46">these positive incredible numbers they</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="5.4">include Obamacare that include</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="5.35">inventories they push numbers into</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="4.97">inventories and we see at this point all</text>
  <text start="449.62" dur="4.83">of this manipulation at this time is</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="3.97">coming to an end and i don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="3.26">they&amp;#39;re going to stop manipulating i</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="5.04">mean that manipulation of the</text>
  <text start="457.71" dur="6.22">statistical numbers it&amp;#39;s losing its</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="6.06">luster they can&amp;#39;t manipulate these</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="6.81">numbers up high enough because the real</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="6.93">economic data continually pulls it down</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="5.79">much much further so i wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="473.83" dur="4.23">surprised if all of a sudden they start</text>
  <text start="476.53" dur="3.24">changing the way they completely</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="3.42">calculate everything to get these</text>
  <text start="479.77" dur="4.14">numbers back up because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="5.07">seeing right now is that everything is a</text>
  <text start="483.91" dur="5.52">complete disaster and we are heading</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.53">into that range right now where things</text>
  <text start="489.43" dur="3.39">are going to continually slide the</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="3.54">president is going to come out and try</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="4.38">to convince everyone that things are</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="5.64">getting better as time goes on and this</text>
  <text start="497.2" dur="6">is what happens during a period of the</text>
  <text start="500.26" dur="5.97">economy falling apart think about 2008</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.16">now the economy was declining very</text>
  <text start="506.23" dur="4.68">rapidly moving into the summer going</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="4.58">into the fall and we had the Fed out</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="4.05">there we had the US government out there</text>
  <text start="512.94" dur="3.01">convincing the people at that point in</text>
  <text start="514.96" dur="2.519">time that everything is contained</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="4.529">everything is fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="6.871">the economy will be improving Lawrence</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="5.011">yen was out there and he was and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.35" dur="2.7">from the national association of</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="3.38">realtors telling everyone that real</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="4.62">estate is going to be bouncing back</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="4.99">during the winter months of 2008 so</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t worry about that he sees signs</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="3.81">that real estate is picking up and they</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="4.32">tried to convince us that the economy</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="4.83">was doing well and what happened we</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="4.23">completely crashed so you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="4.41">see the central bank you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="5.01">Obama you&amp;#39;re going to see all these</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="5.34">people come out more often now to</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="4.32">convince you that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="5.49">well and we we&amp;#39;ve already seen it start</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="6.96">and this tells us something now we also</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="5.94">see an indicator that gold has moved up</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="4.98">quite a bit I mean it almost hit 1,300</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="5.61">or so it&amp;#39;s coming very very close</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="5.73">and we see it took a very big jump today</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="5.55">and this is one of these signals signs</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="4.65">that tells us that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="574.84" dur="3.72">falling apart and I mentioned this in</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="5.12">previous reports and this is something</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="6.48">that we need to watch this is a whisper</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="6.85">letting you know that things are going</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="6.42">to accelerate down the line now are they</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="6.21">going to suppress gold most likely</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="5.88">sunday monday morning all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ll see gold push down now how much</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="3.99">they push it down we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="4.23">see now if they only can get it to come</text>
  <text start="601.33" dur="4.56">down you know five ten fifteen dollars</text>
  <text start="603.4" dur="5.19">we know they&amp;#39;re having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="5.76">and the next leg up is going to be even</text>
  <text start="608.59" dur="5.31">more and this is something we need to</text>
  <text start="611.65" dur="4.86">watch and watch very carefully because</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="4.35">this is a whisper it&amp;#39;s letting us know</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="5.25">that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="6.54">and this is telling you get prepared I</text>

  <text start="635.85" dur="4.27">everyone&amp;#39;s spidey senses should be</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="4.41">tingling at this point realizing</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="4.38">something is going on because the last</text>
  <text start="642.52" dur="6.51">time this happened the housing market</text>

  <text start="649.03" dur="6.15">Canada they have fallen behind russia as</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="4.44">the biggest wheat exporter and because</text>
  <text start="655.18" dur="4.8">of all the GMO foods and things like</text>
