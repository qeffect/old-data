  <text start="128.27" dur="6.39">CNN MSNBC Washington Post New York Times</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="5.58">these are fake headlines they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="4.56">this on purpose to try to control the</text>
  <text start="136.55" dur="5.1">narrative because right now there is no</text>

  <text start="146.269" dur="3.481">of forgot about this there are three</text>
  <text start="148.19" dur="4.68">things they need with the articles of</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="5.58">impeachment testimony from again they</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="4.29">need Trump&amp;#39;s taxes and the grand jury</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="5.01">information from Weisman that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="4.98">the reasons why Pelosi right now is</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="4.2">delaying the articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="5.67">and the other reason is because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="6.33">trying to change the arena change the</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="4.83">landscape in the Senate and this is why</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re holding back this is why they</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="5.46">left for Christmas and they didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.43">anything and we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="4.05">about all of this a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="5.49">this report but first let&amp;#39;s start off</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="6.54">with the fake news headlines here now</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="5.849">CNN on December 22nd this is their</text>
  <text start="188.69" dur="5.16">headline effort to freeze Ukraine aid</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="5.671">began 90 minutes after call between</text>
  <text start="193.85" dur="4.8">Trump and szalinski now the news network</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="4.8">claims that this is what the newly</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="5.97">released emails revealed and it appears</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="5.1">entirely likely that CNN is assuming the</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="5.399">bulk of its readers will go no further</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="5.489">than the headline yes most of them will</text>
  <text start="210.019" dur="5.791">not go past the headline and they will</text>
  <text start="212.269" dur="8.731">believe the headline but when you read</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="7.56">down through the article guess what the</text>
  <text start="221" dur="5.07">article is not exactly what the headline</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="5.79">says and remember the Office of</text>
  <text start="226.07" dur="5.85">Management and Budget remember what they</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="4.95">said well this is what they said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="4.83">reckless to tie the hold of funds to the</text>
  <text start="234.11" dur="5.52">phone call as has been established and</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="6.06">publicly reported the hold was announced</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="6.389">in an interagency meeting on July 18th</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="3.84">that statement which happens to be true</text>
  <text start="246.019" dur="3.181">inaccurate</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s a accurate reflection of the</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="5.73">established fact entirely contradicts</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="5.31">the story&amp;#39;s headline in fact what did</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="6.179">the media do they picked out one line</text>
  <text start="257.66" dur="8.37">from the email and chose to interpret it</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="7.771">in a certain way and when you really</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="4.47">read the entire thing the email support</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="3.69">the Trump administration&amp;#39;s account of</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.13">why Aid was being held up in the first</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="4.65">place the president was skeptical about</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="3.93">sending a to foreign countries without</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="5.55">knowing how the funds would be used</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="5.4">additionally he was loath to have the</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="4.019">u.s. shoulder the burden of aiding</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="5.04">Ukraine if the Europeans were not</text>
  <text start="286.789" dur="7.081">sufficiently pitching in now why did</text>
  <text start="290" dur="5.67">they run the headline December 22nd when</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="3.93">the articles of impeachment have</text>
  <text start="295.67" dur="4.11">been delivered to the Senate why did</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.26">they come up with this headline and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.78" dur="4.65">not just on CNN it&amp;#39;s on mine it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="4.41">MSNBC New York Times Washington Post the</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="3.9">headlines are a little bit different but</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re trying to spin it in a certain</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="7.08">way and once again this is going to fail</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="8.82">because when you dive into what was</text>
  <text start="317.93" dur="6.3">really said the truth comes out and why</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="4.44">are they doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="3.84">hoping they will be able and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="3.6">about the deep State the Dems they will</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="5.55">be able to get something from the Grand</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="4.95">Jury information they&amp;#39;re hoping to get</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="3.54">something from Trump&amp;#39;s taxes that are</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="3.48">all in the Supreme Court and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="5.1">hoping to get some type of testimony</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="4.92">from Doug McGann now are they gonna get</text>
  <text start="342.26" dur="3.69">the taxes are they gonna get the DRAM</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="4.83">grand jury information no I think</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re basing all of this on Doug</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="2.96">McGann and he might have something that</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="6.21">they need</text>
  <text start="351.73" dur="7.78">now remember Nadler has been seeking</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="3.78">this because they need it to go along</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="3.03">with their art of the articles of</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="4.95">impeachment because without it there is</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="6.33">no crime there&amp;#39;s nothing there the two</text>
  <text start="365.9" dur="4.74">articles are meaningless this is why</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="5.13">McConnell&amp;#39;s out there saying listen you</text>
  <text start="370.64" dur="4.74">bring it to the Senate this whole thing</text>
  <text start="374" dur="3.6">is going to collapse right in front of</text>
  <text start="375.38" dur="4.71">your face this is why they&amp;#39;re nervous</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="7.11">about the Supreme Court looking at this</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="6.36">and remember today was the day that we</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="5.37">were gonna get some type of information</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="4.46">and lo and behold that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="3.78">happened</text>
  <text start="390.91" dur="6.13">Nadler remember he needs this material</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="6.72">to move forward and as we suspected</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="6.06">House Counsel Doug letter has responded</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="5.07">to the DC appeals court arguing the</text>
  <text start="403.1" dur="5.61">forced testimony of White House Counsel</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="5.43">Don McGann is needed for evidence in the</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="6.77">impeachment trial I think before I said</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="7.65">Doug it&amp;#39;s Dom again so they need the</text>
  <text start="415.48" dur="6.49">White House counsel&amp;#39;s testimony and</text>
  <text start="418.73" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re pushing for this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.97" dur="5.28">holding off waiting to see if they can</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="4.34">get this if they can&amp;#39;t get this what</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="5.92">else are they doing</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="7.98">trying to flip certain individuals in</text>
  <text start="433.17" dur="5.61">the Senate how cute confirms this which</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="6.23">we&amp;#39;ll be discussing a little bit later</text>
  <text start="438.78" dur="7.69">but first very interestingly bill Barr</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="7.12">he indict s-- eight individuals</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="6">including Muller&amp;#39;s top witness for</text>
  <text start="450.16" dur="4.97">funding millions in foreign donations to</text>
  <text start="452.47" dur="5.58">Schiff Hillary Clinton and Democrats</text>
  <text start="455.13" dur="4.81">remember Nader he was one of Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.6">top witnesses and he&amp;#39;s a top Democrat</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="5.82">donor and he&amp;#39;s convicted of child</text>

  <text start="469.93" dur="6.24">Clinton and several Democratic senators</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="6.25">now the list of dem organizations taking</text>

  <text start="512.44" dur="4.26">out the following there&amp;#39;s no word in the</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="3.66">indictment that Clinton knew that Nader</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="4.89">was acting on behalf of his Highness but</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="4.74">he was and Clinton and her team gave</text>
  <text start="521.59" dur="5.36">Nader an insane amount of access</text>
  <text start="523.42" dur="7.14">reminder Nader is a convicted pedophile</text>

  <text start="551.32" dur="4.32">strongly suggests it</text>
  <text start="553.03" dur="5.52">it was a purpose of the conspiracy for</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="5.49">Nader and khawaja to use their access to</text>

  <text start="2291.97" dur="4.98">will stop at Obama or anyone like that I</text>
  <text start="2295.33" dur="4.68">think it goes way beyond that and I</text>
  <text start="2296.95" dur="5.79">think this is why Hugh is mentioning gs</text>
  <text start="2300.01" dur="7.22">I think this is being done on purpose to</text>
  <text start="2302.74" dur="9.36">let us know that there are players above</text>
  <text start="2307.23" dur="7.09">the president above who we think is the</text>

  <text start="2317.56" dur="4.44">this goes all the way up to the central</text>

  <text start="2322" dur="6.54">to everything trickles down from there</text>
  <text start="2324.91" dur="7.13">and I believe this whole entire message</text>
  <text start="2328.54" dur="6.48">is that we are now in the process of</text>
  <text start="2332.04" dur="7.24">removing everything that they put in</text>
  <text start="2335.02" dur="7.29">place and the only way to do that is by</text>
  <text start="2339.28" dur="4.86">the Great Awakening wakening the masses</text>
  <text start="2342.31" dur="4.74">up and it has to be done and this</text>
  <text start="2344.14" dur="5.25">reminds me of when my children were</text>
  <text start="2347.05" dur="5.37">younger and we watched the bug&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="2349.39" dur="7.05">and there were what a eat grasshoppers</text>
  <text start="2352.42" dur="6.39">and there were thousands of ants but the</text>
  <text start="2356.44" dur="4.83">thousands of ants they were brainwashed</text>
  <text start="2358.81" dur="4.71">by these grasshoppers eight of them and</text>
  <text start="2361.27" dur="6.06">they did whatever they wanted them to do</text>
  <text start="2363.52" dur="8.48">because they lived in fear and then one</text>
  <text start="2367.33" dur="8.25">day there was a Great Awakening one ant</text>
  <text start="2372" dur="4.18">woke up and decided we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="2375.58" dur="3">do this anymore</text>
  <text start="2376.18" dur="6.78">this one ant convinced all the other</text>
  <text start="2378.58" dur="7.35">ends to say no more and all of the ants</text>
  <text start="2382.96" dur="6.78">stood up to the ate grasshoppers</text>
  <text start="2385.93" dur="9.11">I believe this is exactly what we are</text>
  <text start="2389.74" dur="9.21">doing now there&amp;#39;s a few that are now</text>
  <text start="2395.04" dur="7.51">understanding knowing what needs to be</text>
  <text start="2398.95" dur="6.87">done the Great Awakening is about</text>
  <text start="2402.55" dur="7.96">educating the rest of the public once</text>
  <text start="2405.82" dur="7">the public is 80 to 90 percent awake</text>
  <text start="2410.51" dur="5.31">the deep state those non-elected</text>
  <text start="2412.82" dur="4.89">individuals they&amp;#39;re in trouble because</text>
  <text start="2415.82" dur="4.86">then you have to deal with the</text>
  <text start="2417.71" dur="6.69">population when the population is not on</text>
  <text start="2420.68" dur="6.06">your side that&amp;#39;s when they lose think</text>

  <text start="2428.99" dur="5.34">just go in for the arrest because the</text>
  <text start="2430.64" dur="5.78">population wouldn&amp;#39;t be with them because</text>
  <text start="2434.33" dur="6.92">the population was still brainwashed</text>

  <text start="2470.06" dur="4.65">and things like that it&amp;#39;s all being done</text>

  <text start="2482.54" dur="5.31">up and this is why it&amp;#39;s taking so long</text>
  <text start="2484.85" dur="5.79">because you have to wake people up to</text>

  <text start="2490.64" dur="6.27">growing and the deep state is panicking</text>
