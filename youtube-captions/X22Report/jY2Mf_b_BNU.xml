  <text start="116.999" dur="5.61">help of George Soros they were able to</text>
  <text start="119.789" dur="6.061">overthrow the elected government and put</text>
  <text start="122.609" dur="7.081">in a puppet government well she is out</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="7.14">there once again and she is stressing</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="6.51">that the Russian Federation and its</text>
  <text start="132.99" dur="5.4">proxies should not expect the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="5.04">Parliament to amend the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="5.01">constitution before the implementation</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="5.219">of security provisions of the Minsk</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="5.52">agreement now the mints to cease fire</text>
  <text start="146.459" dur="5.25">agreement is very clear they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="7.1">to follow these steps and part of the</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="7.081">steps was changing the Constitution and</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="4.99">she went on to say neither Moscow nor</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="5.61">self-appointed dombasle or ities should</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="5.19">expect the Ukrainian rada to take up</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="4.86">ki outstanding political provisions of</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="7.08">Minsk including elections constitutional</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="5.91">amendments before russia and its proxies</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="5.7">meet their basic security obligations</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="7.23">under the Minsk agreement and as of</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="7.11">right now they have but what Ukraine</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="6.8">wants is they want peacekeepers in the</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="6.539">dawn bass area now this was not part of</text>
  <text start="189.2" dur="6.759">the agreement they have the OSCE there</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="6.241">they&amp;#39;re monitoring the situation and we</text>
  <text start="195.959" dur="6.271">can see Ukraine has been stalling all</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="6.69">along this is why we see Obama out there</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="4.92">calling on Russia to make sure they</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="4.47">adhere to the Mint&amp;#39;s to cease fire</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="6.539">agreement this is why Kerry now is going</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="7.019">to Russia and Russia wants to understand</text>
  <text start="213.689" dur="4.561">why they&amp;#39;re not fulfilling the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="3.481">deal now it&amp;#39;s very strange why they</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="5.489">don&amp;#39;t have Ukraine going there because</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="6.599">Ukraine is the country but it looks like</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="5.78">the United States is the puppet master</text>
  <text start="227.129" dur="6.991">in Ukraine and this is why they called</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="7.18">United States and asking them why this</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.22">hasn&amp;#39;t been done now Victoria Nuland as</text>
  <text start="236.699" dur="6.21">we know she handled the whole coup</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="5.399">d&amp;#39;etat the uprising in ukraine to put in</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="4.08">the puppet government and we can see at</text>
  <text start="244.739" dur="5.46">this point if she&amp;#39;s back in the picture</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="6.03">this means things are really going to</text>
  <text start="250.199" dur="4.29">heat up now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="4.02">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="6.481">they&amp;#39;re moving military assets all over</text>
  <text start="257.039" dur="7.081">the place preparing for war now the US</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="5.85">Army they announced plans to stockpile</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="6.18">munitions and military supplies in</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="4.86">Vietnam Cambodia and several other</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="7.14">undisclosed nations including the</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="12.989">Philippines because the US is preparing</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="8.909">for aggression from China and Russia US</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="7.791">official state that the munitions that</text>
  <text start="286.349" dur="6.111">they&amp;#39;re placing all around here is to</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="5.44">respond to the regional threats by</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="5.87">Russia North Korea</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="6.23">and China now we know that china is</text>
  <text start="301.67" dur="5.26">pushing for sanctions on North Korea</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="4.27">Russia is yelling at North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.93" dur="3.72">trying to separate themselves but the</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="4.85">United States wants them involved</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="6.27">because the players are all the same and</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="6.43">we see right now that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="9.38">worried about China expanding their</text>
  <text start="320.04" dur="6.26">influence in the area translation</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="7.96">spreading their economic influence</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="7.08">throughout the area by passing the</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="5.7">dollar making deals with other countries</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="6.6">and we can see at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="6.12">very nervous about this and they know</text>
  <text start="343.98" dur="7.52">the system is crumbling their orders are</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="7.8">to start a war provoke a war at any cost</text>
  <text start="351.5" dur="5.89">because as the system comes tumbling</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="5.49">down they need to blame someone they</text>
  <text start="357.39" dur="4.97">need to take all eyes off of them and</text>
  <text start="359.85" dur="6.45">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="6.76">we see us Germany France they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="5.97">critical of Israel of their land grab</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="4.59">and the West Bank France is extremely</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="4.89">concerned of the latest seizure of</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="5.31">territory they&amp;#39;re saying that Israel has</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="4.44">announced they&amp;#39;re seizing a large chunk</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.97">of Palestinian land in the occupied West</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="4.68">Bank the UN Secretary is warning Israel</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="4.32">that this is a violation of</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="5.73">international law and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="389.31" dur="4.71">surprised if another offensive or</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="3.78">something occurs in this region once</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="3.78">again and of course they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="5.07">in and taking the people&amp;#39;s land and</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="7.82">we&amp;#39;ve seen this many times throughout</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="7.89">history where the nation with the power</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="8.26">suppresses the smaller people in the</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="6.93">area and they exterminate them and this</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="4.98">is continually going on throughout the</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="5.46">world nothing has really changed now we</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="6.3">know a watchdog group is looking into</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="5.46">war crimes in Yemen they are looking at</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="4.02">Saudi Arabia where they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="426.6" dur="4.2">weapons and they&amp;#39;ve already said to the</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="3.13">US listen you should stop supplying</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="5">Saudi Arabia with these cluster</text>
  <text start="432.31" dur="6.099">because they&amp;#39;re in violation Saudi</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="6.57">Arabia is killing many citizens about</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="6.451">six thousand civilians and we see</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="5.49">already Dutch lawmakers they voted to</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="6.2">ban weapons that they&amp;#39;re sending to</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="6.899">Saudi Arabia we see the United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="8.8">not so much the United States not so</text>
  <text start="454.759" dur="6.81">much and we see the United Nations they</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="8.609">are saying that the saudi-led troops</text>
  <text start="461.569" dur="13.051">they&amp;#39;ve killed civilians children women</text>
  <text start="468.469" dur="9.711">in this war on purpose and we see at</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="6.719">this point let&amp;#39;s see what England does</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="5.68">let&amp;#39;s see what France does let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="481.339" dur="5.311">what the u.s. does but we know they have</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="5.609">an agenda we know they need to get back</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="4.049">into Yemen install the puppet regime we</text>
  <text start="489.469" dur="5.641">know they need to do this in Libya</text>
  <text start="490.699" dur="6.421">Lebanon Iraq and they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="495.11" dur="4.529">into Syria then eventually Iran because</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="5.039">they need to keep this petro dollar</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="5.52">system alive think about what they have</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="7.38">to do to keep their system alive they</text>
  <text start="505.159" dur="10.32">have to kill the people in these</text>
  <text start="509.539" dur="8.04">countries so the dollar stays alive so</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="5.1">the system can be propped up for a</text>
  <text start="517.579" dur="8.87">little while longer so entire families</text>
  <text start="520.579" dur="5.87">are being wiped out for paper and ink</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="5.34">this is not the government that I want</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="5.16">this is not the government I support</text>
  <text start="532" dur="7.48">this is not a government for the people</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="6.989">any people this is just downright</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="3.599">horrific and when people look back in</text>
  <text start="541.339" dur="3.421">history they&amp;#39;re going to look at this</text>
  <text start="543.079" dur="6.151">and they&amp;#39;re going to say these are all</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="7.439">war crimes and most likely there will be</text>
  <text start="549.23" dur="6.33">charges brought against most of these</text>
  <text start="552.199" dur="6.51">people listen during World War two the</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="4.83">people in Germany this is the way it was</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="3.901">this is yes everything&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="5.699">everything&amp;#39;s perfect we&amp;#39;re conquering</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="4.949">the world and then when they lost</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="4.47">all the other nations looked at them and</text>
  <text start="567.559" dur="5.491">said these are war crimes these people</text>
  <text start="570.559" dur="5.28">need to be prosecuted the same things</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="4.05">going to happen again but most likely</text>
  <text start="575.839" dur="4.021">it&amp;#39;s going to be here in the United</text>
  <text start="577.1" dur="4.38">States now we realize at this point that</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="3.839">the United States government the</text>
  <text start="581.48" dur="3.57">coalition forces they are pushing as</text>
  <text start="583.699" dur="4.981">hard as they possibly can to get that</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="6.18">unity government into Libya and they</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="5.699">want them to go into Tripoli and they</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="6.12">want them to remove the government in</text>
  <text start="594.379" dur="4.861">Tripoli so the european union may have</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="6.299">agreed to impose sanctions on three</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="7.8">libyan politicians for opposing the UN</text>

  <text start="614.509" dur="5.221">government in Tobruk is saying that well</text>
  <text start="616.91" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;re not members in the EU and we do</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="5.609">not follow it I refuse to EU threats</text>
  <text start="622.49" dur="5.55">against all Libyans and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="625.339" dur="7.651">that it&amp;#39;s meaningless to us these</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="8.849">sanctions and he blamed England who is</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="6.48">working on a plan to divide Libya and we</text>
  <text start="636.889" dur="6.93">see that yes this is all part of their</text>
  <text start="639.47" dur="6.9">plan they want that government which is</text>
  <text start="643.819" dur="4.921">elected by the gut by the people out of</text>
  <text start="646.37" dur="6.659">power they want their puppet government</text>
  <text start="648.74" dur="8.219">in power so they can bring in the</text>
  <text start="653.029" dur="6.18">coalition forces to regain control of</text>
  <text start="656.959" dur="5.641">the entire country and go after those</text>
  <text start="659.209" dur="5.641">people who oppose them it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="7.2">thing that&amp;#39;s happening in Yemen that</text>
  <text start="664.85" dur="8.76">will be happening in Lebanon now we see</text>

  <text start="680.99" dur="5.039">has also been closed and things are</text>
  <text start="683.36" dur="4.26">really heating up in Turkey it looks</text>
  <text start="686.029" dur="4.56">like uh dawuan is going full</text>
  <text start="687.62" dur="5.63">dictatorship on everyone in there</text>
  <text start="690.589" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re going after journalists teachers</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="6.19">anyone that disagrees with the</text>
  <text start="696.559" dur="6.061">government or reports on the government</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="6.48">in what he is doing this is what they go</text>
  <text start="702.62" dur="8.54">after they shut down social media they</text>
  <text start="705.92" dur="8.22">shut down news sites and this is full-on</text>
  <text start="711.16" dur="7.48">dictatorship this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="714.14" dur="7.68">now it looks like Congress put John</text>
  <text start="718.64" dur="6.87">Kerry the state department and they back</text>
  <text start="721.82" dur="4.98">them into a corner and I like when the</text>
  <text start="725.51" dur="3.12">corporate media comes out and says</text>
  <text start="726.8" dur="3.87">Secretary of State John Kerry has</text>
  <text start="728.63" dur="4.26">unexpectedly determined that yes the</text>
  <text start="730.67" dur="4.44">Islamic state is committing genocide</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="4.65">against Christians and other minority</text>
  <text start="735.11" dur="5.73">groups in Iraq and Syria well they knew</text>
  <text start="737.54" dur="6.9">this they were asking them for quite a</text>
  <text start="740.84" dur="5.97">while to say that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="744.44" dur="4.2">committing genocide but they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="746.81" dur="6.63">to mention this because they were using</text>
  <text start="748.64" dur="8.1">them to get Assad out and we see that</text>
  <text start="753.44" dur="5.88">Congress put pressure on Kerry even</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="5.55">though they&amp;#39;re saying they didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="759.32" dur="5.07">did and what was the State Department</text>
  <text start="762.29" dur="4.7">going to do say no we don&amp;#39;t see this</text>
  <text start="764.39" dur="6.12">they had to say yes at this point</text>
  <text start="766.99" dur="9.67">because they had ample time to analyze</text>
  <text start="770.51" dur="7.59">all of this so now we see that the State</text>
  <text start="776.66" dur="6.17">Department is backed in the corner</text>
  <text start="778.1" dur="8.79">Russia now has the State Department</text>
  <text start="782.83" dur="6.88">talking to Assad trying to come up with</text>
  <text start="786.89" dur="6.33">an agreement now NATO they have brought</text>
  <text start="789.71" dur="5.73">more ships into the Aegean Sea two more</text>
  <text start="793.22" dur="5.03">warships have joined NATO in the Aegean</text>
  <text start="795.44" dur="6.6">Sea the Dutch multi-purpose frigate and</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="6.7">the French Corvette they&amp;#39;ve joined the</text>
  <text start="802.04" dur="5.01">British and fibia ship and four other</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="4.53">warships assigned to the German led</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="5.58">standing NATO marine maritime group two</text>
  <text start="809.48" dur="5.64">now this is a total of seven warships</text>
  <text start="812.63" dur="5.22">and the Aegean Sea at this point which</text>
  <text start="815.12" dur="6.36">is a hop skip and a jump away from the</text>
  <text start="817.85" dur="6.239">entire Mediterranean area so if</text>
  <text start="821.48" dur="5.13">something goes down they are ready to</text>
  <text start="824.089" dur="5.341">move now of course using the cover story</text>
  <text start="826.61" dur="4.38">that it&amp;#39;s for the refugees and this is</text>
  <text start="829.43" dur="5.389">why they&amp;#39;re there no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="830.99" dur="7.62">pre-positioned they&amp;#39;re red</text>
  <text start="834.819" dur="9.101">we see that during the peace talks the</text>
  <text start="838.61" dur="8.099">opposition groups they have one agenda</text>
  <text start="843.92" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s not about humanitarian aid it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.709" dur="5.851">about the transition of Assad now</text>
  <text start="849.8" dur="5.909">remember the transition of Assad will be</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="4.8">made by the people they already said 18</text>
  <text start="855.709" dur="4.291">months from now there will be elections</text>
  <text start="857.36" dur="4.289">to see if Assad stays or goes now this</text>
  <text start="860" dur="4.709">might change but this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="861.649" dur="6.99">done so far but we can see from Geneva 1</text>
  <text start="864.709" dur="7.141">Geneva 2 now Geneva 3 they are doing the</text>
  <text start="868.639" dur="8.01">same thing the entire agenda is how do</text>
  <text start="871.85" dur="6.419">we get Assad out of there now Syria</text>
  <text start="876.649" dur="3.901">completely rejects the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="878.269" dur="5.101">declaration of federal region in the</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="6.149">north and it looks like the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="883.37" dur="5.909">region they&amp;#39;ve taken a vote and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="886.699" dur="6.211">saying yes we are ready to be autonomous</text>
  <text start="889.279" dur="6.691">and of course I don&amp;#39;t know if there were</text>
  <text start="892.91" dur="4.44">any international monitors monitoring</text>
  <text start="895.97" dur="2.7">this vote because we&amp;#39;re getting word</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="4.83">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of Kurds out there</text>
  <text start="898.67" dur="5.13">saying no we don&amp;#39;t want this and we can</text>
  <text start="902.18" dur="4.829">see the Kurds weren&amp;#39;t invited to the</text>
  <text start="903.8" dur="5.639">talks on purpose now Russia is coming</text>
  <text start="907.009" dur="4.861">out saying they are not agreeing with</text>
  <text start="909.439" dur="3.9">the federalization the u.s. is actually</text>
  <text start="911.87" dur="3.81">coming out and saying they don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="913.339" dur="5.94">but if it&amp;#39;s brought up in the peace</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="5.07">process then it might be okay at that</text>
  <text start="919.279" dur="3.93">point so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="920.75" dur="5.009">this very very carefully because we</text>
  <text start="923.209" dur="4.92">realize that the u.s. is cozying up to</text>
  <text start="925.759" dur="5.76">the Kurdish people they&amp;#39;re building two</text>
  <text start="928.129" dur="8.07">runways there and we know their main</text>
  <text start="931.519" dur="6.75">objective is to partition Syria into</text>
  <text start="936.199" dur="4.26">different areas and not just Syria but</text>
  <text start="938.269" dur="7.081">the entire Middle East they want to see</text>
  <text start="940.459" dur="6.69">iCard Sunni type of structure and this</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="3.209">way there they&amp;#39;ll be able to control all</text>
  <text start="947.149" dur="3.18">the different regions and this is what</text>
  <text start="948.559" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish at this</text>
  <text start="950.329" dur="3.93">point so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="952.279" dur="4.23">that situation very very carefully and</text>
  <text start="954.259" dur="5.101">see where this moves and where it ends</text>
  <text start="956.509" dur="5.871">up because if these talks these peace</text>
  <text start="959.36" dur="7.12">talks do not work out we know the u.s.</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="8.509">the coalition forces Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="966.48" dur="6.93">plans are already in motion and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="970.889" dur="6.181">seen Geneva 1 Geneva 2 they have not</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="6.479">worked out at all and the same agenda is</text>
  <text start="977.07" dur="6.69">on the table so I&amp;#39;m not very positive</text>
  <text start="979.889" dur="6.991">about this but we&amp;#39;ll wait and see we see</text>
  <text start="983.76" dur="7.11">the US military they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="986.88" dur="9.139">okay if we get into war with China</text>
  <text start="990.87" dur="8.19">Russia Iran or North Korea the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="996.019" dur="7.391">not ready for this US Army Chief of</text>
  <text start="999.06" dur="6.149">Staff General Mark Miley he is speaking</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="5.4">to the House Armed Service Committee and</text>
  <text start="1005.209" dur="6.421">he&amp;#39;s saying that that we cannot take on</text>
  <text start="1008.81" dur="5.91">these countries at this point we are not</text>
  <text start="1011.63" dur="5.55">at the levels that can execute</text>
  <text start="1014.72" dur="4.26">satisfactorily in terms of time cost in</text>
  <text start="1017.18" dur="4.469">terms of casualties or cost in terms of</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="6.839">military objectives against these</text>
  <text start="1021.649" dur="9.78">countries it just won&amp;#39;t work we will</text>
  <text start="1025.819" dur="9.061">lose and I agree with them the US has</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="7.76">been in war for a very long time</text>
  <text start="1034.88" dur="7.5">throughout the Middle East in Africa</text>
  <text start="1039.189" dur="9.281">troops have been spread all around this</text>
  <text start="1042.38" dur="7.83">globe and the troops are tired and we</text>
  <text start="1048.47" dur="7.32">can see at this point we&amp;#39;re facing</text>
  <text start="1050.21" dur="8.67">massive shortages we are down 500</text>
  <text start="1055.79" dur="6.6">fighter pilots pilots and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="9.41">the gap it is expected to widen to more</text>
  <text start="1062.39" dur="10.2">than 800 as we go into 2018 2019-20 20</text>
  <text start="1068.29" dur="6.07">the soldiers are completely exhausted we</text>
  <text start="1072.59" dur="6.69">see everything that we have right now</text>
  <text start="1074.36" dur="8.4">has been drawn down and we see the</text>
  <text start="1079.28" dur="6.57">American people they&amp;#39;re exhausted we do</text>
  <text start="1082.76" dur="6.6">not want war that&amp;#39;s the furthest thing</text>
  <text start="1085.85" dur="6.56">from our mind going into war we rather</text>
  <text start="1089.36" dur="7.5">have all our troops back here at home</text>
  <text start="1092.41" dur="8.07">with their families living a life here</text>
  <text start="1096.86" dur="6.09">in America not abroad</text>
  <text start="1100.48" dur="6.27">but we see the US government central</text>
  <text start="1102.95" dur="7.35">bankers they have a different objective</text>
  <text start="1106.75" dur="7.96">their objective is to conquer the world</text>
  <text start="1110.3" dur="7.95">their objective is to cover up the</text>
  <text start="1114.71" dur="8.52">system they built and created the system</text>
  <text start="1118.25" dur="8.31">that cannot last a system that is</text>
  <text start="1123.23" dur="6.57">collapsing a system that is dying right</text>
  <text start="1126.56" dur="7.86">now and they know it and every single</text>
  <text start="1129.8" dur="7.77">time these Fiat systems die essential</text>
  <text start="1134.42" dur="6.06">bankers the government&amp;#39;s that report to</text>
  <text start="1137.57" dur="7.59">the central bankers always do the same</text>
  <text start="1140.48" dur="7.68">thing they start war they move your eyes</text>
  <text start="1145.16" dur="7.02">to a different location so they are not</text>
  <text start="1148.16" dur="7.31">to blame and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1152.18" dur="8.76">at this point this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="1155.47" dur="9.37">when we watch a dying Empire this is</text>
  <text start="1160.94" dur="8.91">what we see when we see a dying Empire</text>
  <text start="1164.84" dur="8.58">as we move along we see everything start</text>
  <text start="1169.85" dur="8.75">to break down we see the troops being</text>
  <text start="1173.42" dur="8.52">spread out further and further where</text>
  <text start="1178.6" dur="7.71">they can&amp;#39;t be pushed anymore where they</text>
  <text start="1181.94" dur="8.25">rely on other countries to help out</text>
  <text start="1186.31" dur="7.63">where they try to start wars but the</text>
  <text start="1190.19" dur="6.57">u.s. can&amp;#39;t win any wars anymore think</text>
  <text start="1193.94" dur="7.32">about it what was the last time the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1196.76" dur="8.25">really went up against an adversary that</text>
  <text start="1201.26" dur="5.22">would be a major problem we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="1205.01" dur="6.93">it in a very very actually probably</text>
  <text start="1206.48" dur="7.8">world war two ever since then we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1211.94" dur="5.55">seen any we haven&amp;#39;t been fighting any</text>
  <text start="1214.28" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve been going into countries where</text>
  <text start="1217.49" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re able to walk in overrun them and</text>
  <text start="1219.59" dur="8.78">replace the government&amp;#39;s and at this</text>
  <text start="1223.19" dur="9.869">point with our troops exhausted our</text>
  <text start="1228.37" dur="9.389">military assets all drawn down will</text>
  <text start="1233.059" dur="7.32">we can&amp;#39;t create fighter jets or</text>
  <text start="1237.759" dur="5.5">destroyers or anything that actually</text>
  <text start="1240.379" dur="6.75">works in combat we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="1243.259" dur="5.601">on our hands let these Psychopaths these</text>
  <text start="1247.129" dur="4.821">central bankers the US government</text>
  <text start="1248.86" dur="8.049">they&amp;#39;re just continually pushing for war</text>
  <text start="1251.95" dur="8.229">they believe in their heads that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1256.909" dur="4.801">gonna come out victoriously they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1260.179" dur="3.511">care how many people die I remember they</text>

  <text start="1282.73" dur="9.179">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll have any problem</text>
  <text start="1286.21" dur="9.939">firing off nuclear weapons because at</text>
  <text start="1291.909" dur="6.431">this point they realize they have the</text>
