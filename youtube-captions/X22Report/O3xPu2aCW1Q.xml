  <text start="185.98" dur="8.069">they already know what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>

  <text start="194.049" dur="5.131">continue on this track with borrowing</text>
  <text start="196.599" dur="7.53">and actually forget about continuing</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="7.83">since 2008 we&amp;#39;ve been accelerating the</text>
  <text start="204.129" dur="4.44">borrowing process we&amp;#39;re not slowing it</text>
  <text start="207.01" dur="3.539">down we&amp;#39;re not doing anything we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.569" dur="3.571">continually borrowing at a pace they</text>
  <text start="210.549" dur="5.731">cannot be sustained now the government</text>

  <text start="216.28" dur="6.39">already understand they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.549" dur="9.421">going to happen they&amp;#39;ve run many many</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="10.289">reports on this this is why when Trump</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="5.129">came into office he knew along with the</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="4.021">Patriots and those people that are</text>
  <text start="234.099" dur="6.51">working with him that there was no way</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="6.569">out of this I think before he went in</text>
  <text start="240.609" dur="6.27">when he was talking about bubbles how</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="6.33">the economy&amp;#39;s fake talking about this is</text>
  <text start="246.879" dur="7.17">ridiculous what is going on here Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.879" dur="6.841">running a fake economy at that time</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="3.84">before he had the knowledge I think he</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="4.049">thought he was going to come into office</text>
  <text start="257.889" dur="6.03">and say you know something this economy</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="4.981">is fake it&amp;#39;s an illusion but I think</text>
  <text start="263.919" dur="5.031">when he went in there and he realized</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s no way out of this the system</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="7.33">cannot be turned around the system</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="7.8">cannot be repaired at that point I think</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="5.28">they all decided we have two choices one</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s try to repair it let&amp;#39;s try to</text>
  <text start="281.56" dur="6.63">bring back manufacturing let&amp;#39;s try to</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="7.259">tame the debt and see if we can make</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="5.039">this economy work now they knew right</text>
  <text start="291.639" dur="5.311">there and then that wasn&amp;#39;t going to work</text>
  <text start="293.229" dur="6.451">they knew the central bank system is not</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="4.05">designed to do that because the central</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="4.109">bank is loaning the government money</text>
  <text start="301" dur="4.62">with interest attached and you can never</text>
  <text start="303.789" dur="3.391">stop this it just it just will never</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="3.78">ever stop think of a household</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="5.16">who&amp;#39;s continually taking on debt and</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="4.53">they only making $50,000 a year either</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="3.84">one person working or both people</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="5.759">working but they&amp;#39;re always just making</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="5.789">$50,000 a year say they get a 1%</text>
  <text start="319.689" dur="4.83">but their expenses are continually</text>
  <text start="321.969" dur="5.58">moving up up up the interest on their</text>
  <text start="324.519" dur="6.06">debt is moving up up up and they</text>
  <text start="327.549" dur="4.71">continually take out more debt after a</text>
  <text start="330.579" dur="5.01">certain period of time it cannot be</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="5.82">sustained the same thing with what is</text>
  <text start="335.589" dur="5.34">happening here in America the central</text>
  <text start="338.079" dur="5.36">bank system has set us on a path where</text>
  <text start="340.929" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s no way out the only way out is</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.6">to collapse a system now the central</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="4.56">bankers never going to collapse the</text>
  <text start="348.039" dur="5.071">system because they knew they they would</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="4.02">have this story and they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="3.779">war they can blame it on an event they</text>
  <text start="354.999" dur="3.9">can blame it on many other things this</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="4.14">way they&amp;#39;re not blamed in the end now</text>
  <text start="358.899" dur="4.28">the central bank they have no one to</text>
  <text start="361.029" dur="5">blame this on the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="363.179" dur="6.61">said okay let&amp;#39;s take option two option</text>
  <text start="366.029" dur="6.34">two is we get rid of the central bank we</text>
  <text start="369.789" dur="5.31">collapse the system and we restart the</text>
  <text start="372.369" dur="5.7">system as a people system now if you</text>
  <text start="375.099" dur="5.61">listen to cue and you listen to what has</text>
  <text start="378.069" dur="5.16">been going on here you understand</text>
  <text start="380.709" dur="6.12">the power is going to be returning to we</text>
  <text start="383.229" dur="5.58">the people now that just doesn&amp;#39;t mean oh</text>
  <text start="386.829" dur="3.9">the power is going to come back to the</text>
  <text start="388.809" dur="3.241">people we&amp;#39;re now we have the freedom of</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="3.18">speech now we have the freedom of press</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.229">now we have the freedom you know of all</text>
  <text start="393.909" dur="4.86">these different things that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="396.279" dur="3.87">only part of it the other part of the</text>
  <text start="398.769" dur="3.77">freedom and the power that is being</text>
  <text start="400.149" dur="6.961">brought back to We the People is to</text>
  <text start="402.539" dur="7.24">manage our own economy to create our own</text>
  <text start="407.11" dur="6">currency outside of the central bank</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="7.081">system when you restore the power to the</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="7.019">people it&amp;#39;s not just the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="6.779">it&amp;#39;s also the financial aspect of it</text>
  <text start="420.129" dur="6.12">because if you have a central bank who</text>
  <text start="423.639" dur="5.161">is creating the currency and then</text>
  <text start="426.249" dur="5.73">putting interest on top of that they</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="6.869">control you no matter what we need to</text>
  <text start="431.979" dur="6.35">take control completely back we the</text>
  <text start="435.669" dur="6.95">people will take control of the entire</text>
  <text start="438.329" dur="7.12">system so they opted for option two and</text>
  <text start="442.619" dur="5.681">this is why Trump went ahead and hung</text>
  <text start="445.449" dur="4.86">Andrew Jackson on the wall of the White</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="3.239">House because he campaigned on getting</text>
  <text start="450.309" dur="2.931">rid of the central bank and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.539" dur="4.791">exactly what he did</text>
  <text start="453.24" dur="5.7">here we are right now we are heading</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="5.459">down that path where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="458.94" dur="7.349">remove the central bank this is why</text>
  <text start="461.789" dur="7.621">Trump has been contradicting Powell now</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="6.241">he put Powell into power because he knew</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.5">Powell would raise the rates raise the</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="5.009">rates what happens when you raise the</text>
  <text start="473.91" dur="7.129">rates in an in an economy that&amp;#39;s created</text>
  <text start="477.539" dur="5.97">as one gigantic illusion it implodes</text>
  <text start="481.039" dur="3.91">because it&amp;#39;s not a real economy you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="483.509" dur="2.491">controlling the interest rate you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="2.881">controlling the market you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486" dur="4.889">controlling the statistical numbers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.83" dur="4.829">not a free market so what happens when</text>
  <text start="490.889" dur="6.511">you do this the whole thing just comes</text>
  <text start="492.659" dur="7.081">tumbling down so right now this is what</text>
  <text start="497.4" dur="3.63">has happening now people are saying well</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="3.03">why doesn&amp;#39;t he just get rid of the</text>
  <text start="501.03" dur="3.569">Federal Reserve right now well there</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="3.239">would be a backlash right now because</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="2.461">most of the people don&amp;#39;t even understand</text>
  <text start="506.009" dur="3.84">what the Federal Reserve is the</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="5.609">mainstream media they&amp;#39;re still pushing</text>
  <text start="509.849" dur="5.31">their agenda and they&amp;#39;re on the side of</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="3.961">the Federal Reserve now if Trump went</text>
  <text start="515.159" dur="3.06">ahead and just said we&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="3.51">the Federal Reserve there&amp;#39;d be a</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="5.551">backlash backlash like you&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="7.23">before so what is the plan the plan is</text>
  <text start="523.77" dur="4.35">to demonize and this is not really that</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="4.86">hard to do</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="9.74">demonize and show what the central bank</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="9.08">has actually done once he does this and</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="8.11">once they push an audit bill through</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="9.399">then at that point Trump can make his</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="8.429">move how easy is it to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="550.709" dur="6.151">Federal Reserve well Congress or the</text>
  <text start="554.399" dur="5.791">President may revise their Federal</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="6.539">Reserve Act of 1913 stripping it of its</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="6.72">power in fact the Fed&amp;#39;s monetary policy</text>
  <text start="563.399" dur="5.971">cannot deviate too much from the Cong</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="4.59">from Congress and the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="3.99">political agenda if the US</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="4.649">administration truly wishes to make</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.31">America great again all the president</text>
  <text start="576.149" dur="6.531">needs to do while auditing the Fed is</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="8.28">show how the Federal Reserve deviated</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="7.12">from what their agenda was</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="4.77">now think about what they&amp;#39;ve done up to</text>
  <text start="589.8" dur="4.56">this point do you think it was part of</text>
  <text start="591.72" dur="4.47">their agenda to loan out money to other</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="6.18">countries other banks other central</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="7.11">banks to covertly send money other</text>
  <text start="600.54" dur="9.239">places to pay off people</text>
  <text start="603.3" dur="9.029">no this would make it easy for the</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="6.3">president to say look what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="612.329" dur="7.56">here they went completely against what</text>
  <text start="616.079" dur="6.51">the Federal Reserve Act says and this is</text>
  <text start="619.889" dur="5.76">why Trump has been building this</text>
  <text start="622.589" dur="7.231">narrative against the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="7.201">because in the end what he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s going to take down the Federal</text>
  <text start="632.85" dur="5.549">Reserve and as time goes on and the</text>
  <text start="635.76" dur="6.6">economy deteriorates he&amp;#39;s going to push</text>
  <text start="638.399" dur="6.06">his agenda even harder and continue on</text>
  <text start="642.36" dur="5.219">with the Fed and criticizing the Fed and</text>
  <text start="644.459" dur="6.031">pointing out how specifically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.579" dur="5.181">destroying the economy this has been</text>
  <text start="650.49" dur="4.11">planned for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="4.93">eventually what he&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="8.099">going to push for a free market in money</text>
  <text start="657.69" dur="8.579">on a federal level he&amp;#39;s gonna take over</text>
  <text start="662.699" dur="6.801">the Fed and the government then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="666.269" dur="5.451">create the currency without interest</text>
  <text start="669.5" dur="5.5">they will not need the central bank</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="9.04">whatsoever and this is the plan out</text>
  <text start="675" dur="8.01">remember when this is done on a level of</text>
  <text start="680.76" dur="6.18">just the United States this is going to</text>
  <text start="683.01" dur="7.41">have a domino effect around the world</text>
  <text start="686.94" dur="5.55">because then other countries are go is</text>
  <text start="690.42" dur="4.68">going they&amp;#39;re going to see this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.49" dur="6.089">going to react and many of the countries</text>
  <text start="695.1" dur="5.82">are going to follow suit just like we</text>
  <text start="698.579" dur="4.111">see countries now following suit and</text>
  <text start="700.92" dur="3.69">saying you know something maybe we</text>
  <text start="702.69" dur="3.93">should have bilateral trade deals you</text>
  <text start="704.61" dur="3.12">know something the the people in other</text>
  <text start="706.62" dur="2.76">countries are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="4.349">maybe we don&amp;#39;t need these leaders maybe</text>
  <text start="709.38" dur="4.29">we need somebody else in power and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="712.079" dur="2.641">seeing this backlash this is why we see</text>
  <text start="713.67" dur="2.88">many of the leaders in all these</text>
  <text start="714.72" dur="4.109">different countries this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.55" dur="4.41">getting very very nervous this is why</text>
  <text start="718.829" dur="3.901">they don&amp;#39;t want the power to return</text>
  <text start="720.96" dur="5.13">to the people because once the power</text>
