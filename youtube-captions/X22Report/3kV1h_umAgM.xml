  <text start="75.85" dur="5.309">indicators and we are seeing more and</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="4.77">more indicators that this economy is</text>
  <text start="81.159" dur="4.411">deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="83.02" dur="5.18">yesterday I mentioned the tax receipts</text>
  <text start="85.57" dur="5.67">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at GDP retail</text>
  <text start="88.2" dur="5.14">housing and when we put all this</text>
  <text start="91.24" dur="4.08">together we can see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="3.87">not as strong as the US government</text>
  <text start="95.32" dur="5.19">central bankers want us to believe now</text>
  <text start="97.21" dur="6.36">George Soros very interestingly he is</text>
  <text start="100.51" dur="8.27">selling stocks and buying gold and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.57" dur="8.07">making a major big bearish investments</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="5.26">now if things are stable and everything</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="6.36">is okay the question is why would he be</text>
  <text start="114.04" dur="6.12">doing this at this point now we realize</text>
  <text start="118" dur="4.29">from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="120.16" dur="3.75">at that this economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="122.29" dur="3.9">things are deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="123.91" dur="5.069">quickly we know there&amp;#39;s concerns about</text>
  <text start="126.19" dur="6.15">the brexit we know the vote is coming up</text>
  <text start="128.979" dur="6.061">on june twenty third and even if the</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="6">vote goes through do you really think</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re gonna let the people decide what</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="4.44">the country should do i doubt it i</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="2.7">believe what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re going to shut the whole thing</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="4.53">down they&amp;#39;re going to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="5.849">elections and if the people do vote to</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="5.82">exit the euro guess what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="151.569" dur="4.59">happen the government is going to say</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="5.54">well for your best in your best interest</text>
  <text start="156.159" dur="7.771">we are going to stay in the eurozone and</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.24">just too bad on you and we see this is</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="2.82">what</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="5.43">happen in Greece people went out they</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="4.98">voted for tsipras they thought sybaris</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="4.62">was going to do what they wanted him to</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="5.81">do which was stand up to the bankers and</text>
  <text start="174.16" dur="6.87">the government in the end folded and</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="6.13">again the people voted they thought they</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="6.12">were going to voice their opinion and</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="6.87">the government they voted for again once</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="5.16">again disappointed now most likely this</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="3.87">is going to happen now is George Soros</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="3.72">is he looking into the future or does he</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="3.48">know the future already because a lot of</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="5.55">these central bankers already know what</text>
  <text start="197.89" dur="8.19">is about to happen here and are they</text>
  <text start="201.58" dur="8.04">looking at the situation saying okay we</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="5.37">are ready to bring the system down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="6.44">going to bring it down let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="8.7">getting prepared and this could be a</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="5.74">indicator that the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="3.99">crash here they&amp;#39;re going to bring it</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="4.35">down crash it because we&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="224.14" dur="3.72">lot of individuals out there saying that</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="4.83">something in the second half of this</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="6.36">year is going to happen now we see a lot</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="7.34">of things building up we see things all</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="6.45">around the globe out in the Pacific in</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="5.47">Eastern Europe in the Middle East in</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="6.11">Africa and it&amp;#39;s all coming to a head</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="8.07">right now and very interestingly a</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="8.59">French MP he wants sanctions against</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="6.659">ukraine for not fulfilling the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="5.7">ceasefire agreement now how far is this</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="4.591">going to get most likely absolutely</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="4.53">nowhere but we can see there&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="5.13">already looking at this thing okay the</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="4.47">truth is Ukraine is not fulfilling the</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="4.86">Minsk agreement the United States is</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="5.55">provoking China provoking Russia</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="5.61">provoking North Korea provoking Syria</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="6.24">the United States is out there pushing</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="5.49">war around the world and a lot of</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="3.66">individuals in government are starting</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="2.55">to realize this in Europe because you</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="6.03">have to remember Europe is on the front</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="7.97">lines when more breaks out Europe is on</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="6.04">the front lines now in Afghanistan we</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="5.51">understand that</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="6.15">the troops were never going to leave</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="5.58">Afghanistan the only reason Obama came</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="4.38">out saying that is going to be</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="4.89">withdrawal is because Karzai the</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="4.95">President at the time would not sign the</text>
  <text start="310.7" dur="3.9">bilateral security agreement which would</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="4.89">give the soldiers immunity inside</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="5.28">Afghanistan once Karzai left office and</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.81">Kerry went into Afghanistan to fix the</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="4.35">elections they got the person they</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="4.89">wanted and as soon as that person was</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="5.13">elected they signed the bilateral</text>
  <text start="326.66" dur="6.39">security agreement and now we hear that</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="5.76">Obama approved airstrikes in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="5.22">and this is coming from a senior US</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="6.3">defense official and the new plan may</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="5.25">affect the timeline of the rest of the</text>
  <text start="341.42" dur="4.65">troops being withdrawn from Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="4.38">and remember Afghanistan they have a</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="4.41">pipeline running through Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of copper lithium</text>
  <text start="350.48" dur="5.16">they had the poppy fields where they use</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="4.5">it to pay for covert missions they sell</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="4.11">it as opium around the world they</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="3.9">protected the US soldiers protected and</text>
  <text start="359.75" dur="4.44">we have to remember Russia and China are</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="4.65">in Afghanistan helping the</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="3.69">infrastructure in that area and the</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="4.59">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="6.3">they are never giving up this strategic</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="5.43">location and a country that is rich in</text>
  <text start="374.18" dur="7.26">natural resources they&amp;#39;re not leaving</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="7.47">now very interestingly China realizes</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="4.35">and Russia realizes that the United</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="3.63">States is can is going to continually</text>
  <text start="385.79" dur="5.94">provoke war they&amp;#39;re not going to stop</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="6.66">and we see back in January the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="4.23">liberation army air force they were</text>
  <text start="394.22" dur="3.81">preparing to develop a new fleet of</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="4.47">stealth father spiders and heavy</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="6.03">transport aircraft and the heavy</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="5.1">transport aircraft why 20 transport was</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="3.75">going to be built in order to give</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="4.19">Beijing a fast and reliable platform to</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="4.14">deliver arms anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="6.16">because these planes were able to fly</text>
  <text start="411.95" dur="6.75">something like 3,000 plus miles now</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="5.94">originally they wanted 400 but because</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="6.54">of the experiences with the United</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="5.01">States and what is going on with United</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="5.88">States provoking war around the world</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="6.27">they have ordered 1,000 of these</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="4.76">transport planes which will allow them</text>
  <text start="433.1" dur="6.45">to transport heavy weapons troops</text>
  <text start="435.88" dur="5.83">anywhere in the world and you can see</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="5.28">these countries are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="4.89">what is coming why do you think United</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.29">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="446.6" dur="6.21">been moving military assets slowly but</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="7.079">surely into each part of the world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="6.359">in preparation now we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.199" dur="5.311">getting closer and closer to this summer</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="3.72">event now it seems like everything is on</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="3.6">track while the indicators are still</text>
  <text start="462.889" dur="3.721">pointing to it we just got another</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.26">indicator that something is about to</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="5.85">happen the Department of State warns US</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="5.519">citizens against all travel to Libya</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="6.32">right now and recommends that US</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="6.181">citizens currently in Libya leave now</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="4.359">they&amp;#39;re saying the security situation in</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="6.12">Libya remains unpredictable and unstable</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="7.021">and the Islamic state is running crazy</text>
  <text start="487.19" dur="6.87">around the entire country and those</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="6.689">people that are in the country make</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="6.78">contingency plans to get out of the</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="5.761">country as soon as possible and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="4.38">forget to maintain security awareness at</text>
  <text start="502.61" dur="4.619">all times so this is another indicator</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="6.18">showing us that they are planning for</text>
  <text start="507.229" dur="5.49">something in the summer and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="2.43">starting to see and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="3.541">put all the pieces together and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="5.699">starting to realize that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="7.23">this plan forward now Russia they are</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="6.361">driving into raka right now they are</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="4.65">moving very quickly they&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="4.29">oil facilities they&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="4.68">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re pushing them back</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="5.909">and we know the United States was on the</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="4.8">other end they were driving into raka</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="4.351">saying that they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="6.03">Islamic state but very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="5.85">u.s. is retreating in rocket as the</text>
  <text start="543.65" dur="4.89">Syrian army and Russia are moving in</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="5.73">very quickly now they&amp;#39;ve taken their</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="5.669">forces and they reposition them into man</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="4.62">beach and saying okay we really want to</text>
  <text start="554.209" dur="5.311">conquer man beach because this will help</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="5.28">us into removing Assad this is a</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="4.8">strategic location and we need this city</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="3.03">so it looks like wherever the Syrian</text>
  <text start="564.32" dur="5.28">Army and the rush</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="8.73">forces are they are no match and the</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="7.53">u.s. cannot battle in the same area and</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="4.89">they know this and what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="2.97">to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to take the</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="5.61">Islamic state we place them with the</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="6.27">moderate rebels and say okay we now have</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="3.99">this area but it seems like the Syrian</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="4.71">armed forces in Russia they are moving</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="4.83">very very quickly now now in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="591.08" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re starting to find out and this is</text>
  <text start="593" dur="6.24">coming from the monitoring groups that</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="5.25">30 civilians have died in Aleppo turkey</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="5.28">blame this on Russia and we&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="601.64" dur="5.16">out that this was really the us-led</text>
  <text start="604.52" dur="5.01">coalition where they bombed this area</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="4.65">and they hit 30 civilians at this point</text>
  <text start="609.53" dur="6.12">and we can see this happens and it</text>
  <text start="611.45" dur="6.45">occurs very often now coming from the UN</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="4.71">envoy we see that the Syria peace talks</text>
  <text start="617.9" dur="6.39">for now they are not going ahead with</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="7.86">them and we realized there was a date</text>
  <text start="624.29" dur="7.89">and that date the deadline was August</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="7.41">first to have some type of transitional</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="6.42">government and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="6.99">the transitional government does not</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="7.26">include Assad stepping down now remember</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="7.29">August first of this year what do we</text>
  <text start="645.86" dur="6.9">have right now well we have two aircraft</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="6.27">carriers now in the Mediterranean with</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="6.18">their Strike groups we realize there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="5.49">travel warnings as a warning and Libya</text>
  <text start="658.94" dur="5.34">now and I&amp;#39;m going to guess there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="661.67" dur="5.04">to be many more warnings coming out from</text>
  <text start="664.28" dur="3.96">all the surrounding areas where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.71" dur="4.32">going to tell Americans to stay out of</text>
  <text start="668.24" dur="5.7">the area completely we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="671.03" dur="6.38">2013 we saw it back in 2014 and we saw</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="7.23">it back in 2015 and here we are in 2016</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="7.18">so it looks like at this point the</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="6.36">United States is gradually going to plan</text>
  <text start="684.59" dur="4.56">B we see the United States and all the</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="3.57">NATO member states they&amp;#39;re attracting</text>
  <text start="689.15" dur="4.35">more and more forces into the area we</text>
  <text start="691.1" dur="4.89">know Ashton Carter did the whole thing</text>
  <text start="693.5" dur="4.759">went around we know the refugees was to</text>

  <text start="708.339" dur="7.17">in Syria they want to outnumber them</text>
  <text start="711.759" dur="5.94">with troops and assets and the only way</text>
  <text start="715.509" dur="4.94">they can do this at this point is to</text>

  <text start="752.379" dur="5.221">autonomous regions which they will then</text>
  <text start="754.959" dur="4.68">not report to Damascus and we already</text>
  <text start="757.6" dur="4.399">know there&amp;#39;s a secret agreement with</text>
  <text start="759.639" dur="4.2">Turkey to set up these type of zones</text>
  <text start="761.999" dur="4.93">even though the United States is</text>
  <text start="763.839" dur="5.67">continually denying this and we see</text>
  <text start="766.929" dur="5.43">Belgium Denmark Norway Sweden Finland</text>
  <text start="769.509" dur="5.64">all their air forces they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="772.359" dur="5.611">assisting in this fight along with the</text>
  <text start="775.149" dur="6.72">UK along with France and we already know</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="6.329">UK the United States France and believe</text>
  <text start="781.869" dur="5.16">me many other countries they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="784.299" dur="4.38">in the country why do you think they</text>
  <text start="787.029" dur="4.23">built the two bases in Syria in the</text>
  <text start="788.679" dur="3.9">northern region because this was to</text>
  <text start="791.259" dur="2.79">bring in the troops to bring in the</text>
  <text start="792.579" dur="6.09">military assets and they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="794.049" dur="7.14">this time to do this and at this point</text>
  <text start="798.669" dur="4.47">the indicators are still pointing in</text>
  <text start="801.189" dur="3.661">this way we know we have this August</text>
  <text start="803.139" dur="5.25">first date and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="804.85" dur="6.089">need to watch now the FBI they are</text>
  <text start="808.389" dur="4.29">ramping up their sting operations</text>
  <text start="810.939" dur="3.36">against the Islamic state now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.679" dur="4.11">very interesting is the FBI came out and</text>
  <text start="814.299" dur="4.77">said that you know the amount of people</text>
  <text start="816.789" dur="4.14">looking at the Islamic state sites and</text>
  <text start="819.069" dur="5.46">the amount of people that are going over</text>
  <text start="820.929" dur="5.19">to fight has been decreasing well as we</text>
  <text start="824.529" dur="2.941">know they&amp;#39;ve been decreasing because the</text>
  <text start="826.119" dur="5.321">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="6.61">are not funding to get these</text>
  <text start="831.44" dur="5.04">fighters these paid mercenaries over to</text>
  <text start="834.08" dur="4.08">the fight because Russia is destroying</text>
  <text start="836.48" dur="3.63">them and anywhere the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="3.87">is just bad news so then we have al</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="4.08">Qaeda and al-nusrah where everything is</text>
  <text start="842.03" dur="5.91">morphing into and this is why the FBI is</text>
  <text start="844.19" dur="6.69">not seeing any of this now most of its</text>
  <text start="847.94" dur="4.59">made up and anyone that&amp;#39;s going over to</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="3.84">the Islamic state that is coming from</text>
  <text start="852.53" dur="5.19">the agencies which they are paying them</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="6.09">to be paid mercenaries in the fight but</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="5.85">the FBI they&amp;#39;re ramping up their Islamic</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.68">state recruiting sting operations now a</text>
  <text start="863.57" dur="4.11">lot of legal experts criticized that</text>
  <text start="865.49" dur="5.9">this is completely entrapment which it</text>
  <text start="867.68" dur="6.6">is and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.39" dur="4.75">convincing citizens to do things they</text>
  <text start="874.28" dur="4.98">normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="876.14" dur="5.52">the citizens are the mentally ill now</text>
  <text start="879.26" dur="4.29">the FBI admits that there&amp;#39;s hundreds of</text>
  <text start="881.66" dur="4.83">sting operations going on going right</text>
  <text start="883.55" dur="4.41">now despite the reports that are</text>
  <text start="886.49" dur="4.26">continually coming out that two-thirds</text>
  <text start="887.96" dur="6.09">of the FBI terror prosecutions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="890.75" dur="6.54">based on FB i fabricated plots think</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="5.52">about this the recent arrest resulted</text>
  <text start="897.29" dur="4.47">after the FBI ship fake guns to people</text>
  <text start="899.57" dur="4.2">who had no prior ties to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="901.76" dur="4.29">state and then arrested them for</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="5.22">plotting terror actions the FBI also</text>
  <text start="906.05" dur="4.77">made plane tickets to Syria easily</text>
  <text start="908.99" dur="4.35">available and then arrested recipient of</text>
  <text start="910.82" dur="5.94">those tickets at the airport most</text>
  <text start="913.34" dur="5.19">recently an FBI agent gave a panhandler</text>
  <text start="916.76" dur="4.7">some money and a knife and told him to</text>
  <text start="918.53" dur="6.29">stab people for the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="921.46" dur="6.52">the most appalling example of the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.82" dur="6.61">radicalization is the arrest of a</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="5.94">mentally ill 25 year old Emmanuel lunch</text>
  <text start="931.43" dur="5.4">men of rochester new york who was</text>
  <text start="933.92" dur="6.12">steered toward attacking an area bar on</text>
  <text start="936.83" dur="5.67">New Year&amp;#39;s Eve for the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="940.04" dur="5.1">lunch minh first reached out to the FBI</text>
  <text start="942.5" dur="5.37">agent about his desire to travel the</text>
  <text start="945.14" dur="7.26">world but then the agent started to talk</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="6.87">about the islamic state about proving</text>
  <text start="952.4" dur="4.47">himself and if you prove yourself you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="5.4">be able to travel and all you have to do</text>
  <text start="956.87" dur="6.54">is carry out a domestic attack and the</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="4.83">FBI went ahead coax this person into</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="5.369">doing it and</text>
  <text start="964.97" dur="7.14">you know was going ahead with the entire</text>
  <text start="968.779" dur="5.79">plan now his parents saying that he</text>
  <text start="972.11" dur="5.459">never talked about this he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="974.569" dur="6.21">the mental capacity to do this and it</text>
  <text start="977.569" dur="6.651">looks like from the Department of</text>
  <text start="980.779" dur="6.99">Justice filing and the family assessment</text>
  <text start="984.22" dur="6.099">the young man he lacked the means to buy</text>
  <text start="987.769" dur="6.021">the supplies or the mental wherewithal</text>
  <text start="990.319" dur="6.601">to carry out the attack on his own and</text>
  <text start="993.79" dur="7.089">this is what the United States is doing</text>
  <text start="996.92" dur="6.599">now it&amp;#39;s using its own citizens going to</text>
  <text start="1000.879" dur="5.64">the people that need funds those people</text>
  <text start="1003.519" dur="6.26">that are mentally ill and convincing</text>
  <text start="1006.519" dur="8.36">them into becoming the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1009.779" dur="7.691">that&amp;#39;s pure entrapment this is not a</text>

  <text start="1020.29" dur="6.119">land of the United States this is the</text>

  <text start="1026.409" dur="5.721">to coerce people into doing things which</text>
  <text start="1029.919" dur="4.561">they actually don&amp;#39;t even really do and</text>
  <text start="1032.13" dur="4.09">they trap them into this to show the</text>
