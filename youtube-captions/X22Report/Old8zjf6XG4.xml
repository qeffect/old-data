  <text start="1292.57" dur="6.66">again the mainstream media was out there</text>
  <text start="1296.68" dur="4.74">saying that most likely he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1299.23" dur="4.89">resign and he&amp;#39;s going to blame it on</text>
  <text start="1301.42" dur="5.61">poor health now they&amp;#39;re just making</text>
  <text start="1304.12" dur="5.72">things up they&amp;#39;re not even dealing with</text>
  <text start="1307.03" dur="6.9">facts anymore they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="1309.84" dur="7.17">conspiracy theorists so when we start to</text>
  <text start="1313.93" dur="8.07">look at this now the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1317.01" dur="7.18">they are pushing conspiracies why why</text>
  <text start="1322" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t they have the information anymore</text>
  <text start="1324.19" dur="5.94">why don&amp;#39;t they have the upper hand</text>
  <text start="1326.17" dur="7.41">anymore because the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="1330.13" dur="5.76">control and you can see this you can see</text>
  <text start="1333.58" dur="3.96">how the intelligence organizations that</text>
  <text start="1335.89" dur="4.26">used to feed the mainstream media all</text>
  <text start="1337.54" dur="5.19">the information they don&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="1340.15" dur="6.84">anymore and the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="1342.73" dur="6.96">wrong almost every single time they</text>
  <text start="1346.99" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t get the story straight even from</text>
  <text start="1349.69" dur="4.14">their anonymous sources because the</text>
  <text start="1351.64" dur="3.99">anonymous sources don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1353.83" dur="3.14">information and a lot of times they just</text>
  <text start="1355.63" dur="5.25">make it up</text>
  <text start="1356.97" dur="6.31">and they&amp;#39;re falling flat and the people</text>
  <text start="1360.88" dur="5.52">are starting to notice this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1363.28" dur="6.62">getting worse for them now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="1366.4" dur="7.08">about Jeffrey Epstein the two guards</text>
  <text start="1369.9" dur="7.5">that were handling the protection of</text>
  <text start="1373.48" dur="6.66">Jeffrey Epstein that didn&amp;#39;t stick around</text>
  <text start="1377.4" dur="5.38">they are going to be charged with</text>
  <text start="1380.14" dur="5.25">falsifying prison records after turning</text>
  <text start="1382.78" dur="4.23">down a plea deal last week the two</text>
  <text start="1385.39" dur="3.419">prison guards who were working overtime</text>
  <text start="1387.01" dur="4.95">broke protocols and failed to check on</text>
  <text start="1388.809" dur="5.101">Epstein every 30 minutes even though he</text>
  <text start="1391.96" dur="3.959">was previously placed on suicide once</text>
  <text start="1393.91" dur="3.09">then removed from monitoring shortly</text>
  <text start="1395.919" dur="3.031">before his death</text>
  <text start="1397" dur="3.66">the guards reportedly falsified the</text>
  <text start="1398.95" dur="3.5">prison logs to make it look like they</text>
  <text start="1400.66" dur="4.49">were carrying out their duties and</text>
  <text start="1402.45" dur="5.59">checking on Epstein every half-hour the</text>
  <text start="1405.15" dur="8.05">question is were they working with</text>
  <text start="1408.04" dur="7.769">others that&amp;#39;s what we need to know and I</text>
  <text start="1413.2" dur="4.88">do believe they pleaded not guilty to</text>
  <text start="1415.809" dur="5.521">this now are they gonna turn over</text>
  <text start="1418.08" dur="4.9">important information we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="1421.33" dur="6.87">how this all plays out but very</text>
  <text start="1422.98" dur="7.59">interestingly Maria former who was in</text>
  <text start="1428.2" dur="5.96">New York when she met Epstein and</text>
  <text start="1430.57" dur="6.87">Maxwell they all met at an art show and</text>
  <text start="1434.16" dur="7.71">it looks like Jeffrey Epstein and</text>
  <text start="1437.44" dur="7.17">Maxwell brought her into their world and</text>
  <text start="1441.87" dur="5.47">she says she was sexually assaulted</text>
  <text start="1444.61" dur="4.41">while staying at Wexler&amp;#39;s estate when</text>
  <text start="1447.34" dur="3.9">she tried to escape the next day a</text>
  <text start="1449.02" dur="5.82">member of Wexner staff confronted her</text>
  <text start="1451.24" dur="5.85">his exact words were you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1454.84" dur="5.25">anywhere you&amp;#39;re never leaving you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1457.09" dur="6.12">never leaving she called her father and</text>
  <text start="1460.09" dur="7.55">he helped her flee and it turns out that</text>
  <text start="1463.21" dur="7.5">Ghislaine Maxwell cold farmer and</text>
  <text start="1467.64" dur="6.909">threatened her she said there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="1470.71" dur="6.57">ways to die now that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1474.549" dur="5.491">how these individuals threatened people</text>
  <text start="1477.28" dur="6.98">and they made sure that these</text>
  <text start="1480.04" dur="5.97">individuals never got out of their</text>
  <text start="1484.26" dur="4.39">system</text>
  <text start="1486.01" dur="5.13">and as we can see many of these</text>
  <text start="1488.65" dur="6.06">individuals have and this is why they</text>
  <text start="1491.14" dur="6.24">turned on Jeffrey Epstein and all of</text>
  <text start="1494.71" dur="5.25">this is being investigated right now the</text>
  <text start="1497.38" dur="5.49">investigations have not stopped they are</text>
  <text start="1499.96" dur="7.4">continuing and something else very</text>
  <text start="1502.87" dur="8.36">interesting just out of nowhere happened</text>
  <text start="1507.36" dur="7.9">Sweden decided to drop the investigation</text>
  <text start="1511.23" dur="6.91">of Julian Assange they were looking into</text>
  <text start="1515.26" dur="5.49">the rape accusations they were</text>
  <text start="1518.14" dur="7.59">investigating they reported they had</text>
  <text start="1520.75" dur="9.15">some news and they decided to drop at</text>
  <text start="1525.73" dur="9.51">all why well let&amp;#39;s go back to post 33 41</text>
  <text start="1529.9" dur="10.68">and it says under protection that is</text>
  <text start="1535.24" dur="8.189">real key to DNC source hack 187 Julian</text>
  <text start="1540.58" dur="5.88">Assange is under protection he&amp;#39;s the key</text>

  <text start="1561.79" dur="6.57">going to be used when he is needed and</text>
  <text start="1564.97" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s going to let everyone know how all</text>
  <text start="1568.36" dur="5.42">of this went down</text>
  <text start="1569.74" dur="8.939">and this is why Q says key to the DNC</text>

  <text start="1578.679" dur="5.431">the hack of the DNC he&amp;#39;s going to set</text>
  <text start="1581.98" dur="5.819">the record straight and guess what he</text>

  <text start="1587.799" dur="5.461">pardoned an army first lieutenant Clint</text>

  <text start="1598.27" dur="5.1">night and reunited with his family</text>
  <text start="1600.79" dur="5.61">now the mainstream media and many others</text>
  <text start="1603.37" dur="4.65">are freaking out and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="1606.4" dur="4.74">know this is absolutely ridiculous that</text>
  <text start="1608.02" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s allowing these individuals to be</text>

  <text start="1615.97" dur="3.9">prison for this</text>
  <text start="1617.62" dur="5.67">well we need to look at some facts here</text>
  <text start="1619.87" dur="8.46">in Julian&amp;#39;s rum tweeted out the pardons</text>
  <text start="1623.29" dur="7.2">by presidents Clinton 459 pardons did he</text>
  <text start="1628.33" dur="6.06">go to prison mom he wasn&amp;#39;t peached</text>

  <text start="1641.46" dur="5.73">they want to put him in prison does that</text>
  <text start="1645.79" dur="6.21">make any sense</text>

  <text start="1739.68" dur="7.24">issue they dominate and it goes on and</text>
  <text start="1744.4" dur="5.49">on and on so basically what this is</text>
  <text start="1746.92" dur="4.2">saying is that this whole thing in</text>
  <text start="1749.89" dur="5.76">Ukraine</text>

  <text start="1772.18" dur="7.23">they activated those individuals phones</text>
  <text start="1774.97" dur="7.47">and got this recording and then down</text>
  <text start="1779.41" dur="5.76">below it says FISA goes both ways Q has</text>
  <text start="1782.44" dur="5.82">mentioned this before that they use FISA</text>
  <text start="1785.17" dur="6.56">now to spy on those people that are</text>
  <text start="1788.26" dur="7.17">treasonous that committed crimes and</text>
  <text start="1791.73" dur="7.33">they can spy on other individuals in</text>
  <text start="1795.43" dur="6.69">other countries q says information</text>
  <text start="1799.06" dur="5.4">warfare q now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1802.12" dur="6.03">about this is that the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1804.46" dur="6.51">Foundation revenue dropped to a 16 year</text>
  <text start="1808.15" dur="5.4">low in 2018 and reported a third</text>
  <text start="1810.97" dur="6.09">straight year of losses a trend that</text>
  <text start="1813.55" dur="6.11">began in 2016 so the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="1817.06" dur="6.09">reported a 30 point 7 million in</text>
  <text start="1819.66" dur="6.94">revenues in its recently released 2018</text>
  <text start="1823.15" dur="6.03">Form 990 tax return the lowest figure</text>
  <text start="1826.6" dur="5.46">posted by the charity since 2002 when it</text>
  <text start="1829.18" dur="5.76">raised twenty five point six million now</text>
  <text start="1832.06" dur="6.03">when you&amp;#39;re looking at this and you go</text>
  <text start="1834.94" dur="5.88">back to 2007 2008 2009 when she was</text>
  <text start="1838.09" dur="5.49">running against Obama the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1840.82" dur="6.81">Foundation revenues well they were</text>
  <text start="1843.58" dur="7.68">between 200 and 250 million when she</text>
  <text start="1847.63" dur="6.6">lost they dropped down to around 140</text>
  <text start="1851.26" dur="5.55">million and they kept dropping then she</text>
  <text start="1854.23" dur="5.09">decided she was going to run for the</text>
  <text start="1856.81" dur="5.61">2016 election and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1859.32" dur="7.78">the revenue started to pick up again and</text>
  <text start="1862.42" dur="8.7">it jumped in 2013 to 150 million in 2014</text>
  <text start="1867.1" dur="5.88">it was like 175 million and then when it</text>
  <text start="1871.12" dur="5.28">people started to realize that she</text>
  <text start="1872.98" dur="6.54">wasn&amp;#39;t going to win all of a sudden it</text>
  <text start="1876.4" dur="4.38">started to fall off and after 2016 it</text>
  <text start="1879.52" dur="4.89">dropped</text>
  <text start="1880.78" dur="7.32">to below 20-something million or thirty</text>
  <text start="1884.41" dur="5.34">million dollars so that right there is</text>
  <text start="1888.1" dur="4.47">very interesting and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1889.75" dur="5.49">the probe into the Clinton Foundation is</text>
  <text start="1892.57" dur="7.8">still going on and US attorney John</text>
