  <text start="126.84" dur="3.93">of the shutdown and then when they give</text>

  <text start="135.33" dur="5.79">going all the time No Deal market goes</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.28">down hope of a deal market goes up</text>

  <text start="150.15" dur="5.759">well their earnings are coming in way</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.56">below expectations and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="155.909" dur="4.621">retail stores and a lot of the major</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.64">corporations are laying off people and</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;re trying to cut expenses and</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re not doing as well as everyone</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="6.75">thinks especially for you know for how</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="7.86">high they market is right now it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="8.22">even make sense and we can see there are</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="6.54">many reasons out there why the market</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="5.581">and everything is not going well and you</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="5.85">know there are a lot of retail stores</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="5.85">right now explaining that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="5.369">think this holiday season is going to be</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="5.159">a very fruitful season that the sales</text>
  <text start="195.629" dur="7.23">are going to be much lower than expected</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="9.381">and many retailers across America a</text>
  <text start="202.859" dur="7.56">saying this and in my previous reports I</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="5.619">continually harp on the fact that retail</text>
  <text start="210.419" dur="5.25">sales are declining we saw the</text>
  <text start="212.549" dur="6.09">back-to-school sales laptop sales were</text>
  <text start="215.669" dur="5.4">down school supplies were down people</text>
  <text start="218.639" dur="5.341">buying clothing for school were down and</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="5.04">all the stores were reporting this and</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="5.849">they expected the back-to-school sales</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="6.181">to be really hopping and good and things</text>
  <text start="229.829" dur="5.071">working out but what we see is there</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="6.69">they weren&amp;#39;t doing well and people</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="6.929">weren&amp;#39;t out there purchasing supplies</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="5.039">for school and why was that well we have</text>
  <text start="241.829" dur="5.99">to look back of what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="6.75">we understand that unemployment is at</text>
  <text start="247.819" dur="5.17">7.3 percent or 7.4 whatever made up</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="4.86">number they have but that&amp;#39;s not the real</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="4.53">picture of unemployment because they</text>
  <text start="255.629" dur="3.961">manipulated the calculation and i know i</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="4.171">repeat myself over and over about this</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="4.799">but for those people who are new just</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.74">started listening in 1994 they</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="4.231">completely changed the calculation for</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="3.81">unemployment they do now they do not</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="4.74">count the people who have dropped off</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.049">and they massage the numbers to make</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="2.82">them look better</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="4.02">and they really are and if we look at</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.109">the calculations right now the</text>
  <text start="278.309" dur="4.08">unemployment is around twenty three</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="4.201">twenty four percent and it pretty much</text>
  <text start="282.389" dur="4.471">matches up with other nations that are</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="6.299">having the same type of problem Greece</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="7.91">Cyprus Spain Portugal France you name it</text>
  <text start="290.789" dur="7.44">their unemployment is just as high and</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.859">you know we saw msgs from walmart we saw</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="6.09">a messages from macy&amp;#39;s we see messages</text>
  <text start="300.629" dur="7.47">from williams-sonoma sales corp that</text>
  <text start="304.319" dur="9.24">they&amp;#39;re all expecting sales to decline</text>
  <text start="308.099" dur="8.94">during this season and we are not being</text>
  <text start="313.559" dur="6.57">back in February in a USA Today article</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="6.891">they had many stores closing down and I</text>
  <text start="320.129" dur="8.07">see Barnes and Noble best buy gamestop</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="6.879">radioshack all getting rid of many many</text>
  <text start="328.199" dur="5.52">stores and people and after this</text>
  <text start="330.809" dur="5.4">Christmas season we&amp;#39;re going to see even</text>
  <text start="333.719" dur="5.641">more retail stores closed because guess</text>
  <text start="336.209" dur="5.971">what the economy is doing a lot worse</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="6.75">than what everyone is being led to</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="7.889">believe the Fed is the entire market now</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="6.419">we are living in an illusion the numbers</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="5.21">the GDP numbers the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="352.529" dur="6">the inflation numbers are all</text>
  <text start="355.279" dur="6.49">manufactured to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="358.529" dur="7.021">economy is doing much better than it</text>
  <text start="361.769" dur="7.561">really is and they were going to use the</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="6.03">event in Syria and hopefully what when</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="4.589">that happened they were going to blame</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.25">this on another country of why the</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="5.64">economy started to tank because remember</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.309">this whole summer they were building up</text>
  <text start="379.559" dur="4.29">the propaganda that the economy was</text>
  <text start="382.139" dur="4.08">getting better housing is getting better</text>
  <text start="383.849" dur="5.25">retail is getting better unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.219" dur="5.85">going down and they lost the event of</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="5.1">Syria so what they&amp;#39;re using now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.069" dur="4.38">using the shutdown and saying that the</text>
  <text start="394.199" dur="5.161">economy is starting to falter because</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="5.28">the shutdown as it goes on longer and</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="4.529">longer closer to the default date the</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="4.701">economy might not be able to get out of</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="7.011">what is happening right now and the</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="5.91">fed now is diverting the blame off of</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="4.74">itself and blaming the government</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="6.15">shutdown of why they didn&amp;#39;t paper and we</text>
  <text start="415.64" dur="4.35">know that&amp;#39;s all false and fake that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="4.02">not the reason why they didn&amp;#39;t taper</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="6.18">they are waiting for the next event and</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="6.87">they are going to drag this out until</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="5.01">they create the next event to blame on</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="4.29">another country because what happens is</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="5.13">the Fed does not want to be blamed for</text>
  <text start="433.67" dur="4.77">the collapse the government does not</text>
  <text start="436.31" dur="4.41">want to be blamed for the collapse right</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="4.47">now it&amp;#39;s on the Fed it&amp;#39;s moved to the</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="5.1">government and the government needs it</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="6.54">needs to move it off of itself so it</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="5.55">will create an event to take everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="4.65">eyes off the government and put it on</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.71">another country and blame it on this is</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="4.14">why the economy is declining but in all</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="5.76">my reports that I&amp;#39;ve been doing I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="7.2">been showing housing retail unemployment</text>
  <text start="461.84" dur="8.49">it is all in a decline it is all an</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="7.47">illusion it is all fake and here are</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="4.2">some other reasons why things are not</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="4.14">going well and some of them I mentioned</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="4.29">before domestic vehicle sales just</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="5.43">experienced their largest miss relative</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="5.7">to expectations since January 2009 one</text>
  <text start="482.48" dur="3.81">of the largest furniture manufacturers</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="4.38">in America were recently forced into</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="6.87">bankruptcy according to The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="7.74">Journal the holiday season is projected</text>
  <text start="493.16" dur="6">to be worse than we&amp;#39;ve seen since 2009</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="4.05">the Baltic Dry Index recently</text>
  <text start="499.16" dur="4.44">experienced the largest four-day drop</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="4.74">that we&amp;#39;ve seen in 11 months Merck is</text>
  <text start="503.6" dur="4.02">laying off this is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="4.65">drug companies laying off around 8,500</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="6.54">people but then again we see many</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="6.15">companies there was another one tever i</text>
  <text start="514.16" dur="4.62">think it was it was an israeli drug</text>
  <text start="516.23" dur="4.53">company that makes the generic brands</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="4.44">they were laying off thousands of people</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="5.13">we also see Wells Fargo Citibank Bank of</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="4.11">America all laying off people in the</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="4.11">thousands laying off people in their</text>
  <text start="527.33" dur="5.49">mortgage their mortgage division and the</text>
  <text start="530" dur="5.91">reason why we&amp;#39;re seeing this is because</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="5.37">housing is in a decline state right now</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="2.1">people because of housing was booming</text>
  <text start="539.78" dur="1.53">you</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="3.03">wouldn&amp;#39;t get rid of the mortgage</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="3.54">division because you would bring on more</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="3.9">people because you have so many loans</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="5.28">going out but since you don&amp;#39;t and houses</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="4.5">in a decline and most of the housing</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s being purchased right now is in</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="4.38">cash because they&amp;#39;re being purchased by</text>
  <text start="554.269" dur="4.171">hedge funds and other investment firms</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="5.01">to drive the price up and now they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="561.11" dur="3.839">trying to sell the houses but you know</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="3.99">there are no real buyers right now</text>
  <text start="564.949" dur="5.731">because they&amp;#39;ve you know push the</text>
  <text start="567.23" dur="6.15">housing prices up again not to the point</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="4.469">where they were but up again and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.38" dur="4.29">making everyone believe that the housing</text>
  <text start="575.149" dur="3.81">is recovering when it really isn&amp;#39;t and</text>

  <text start="634.519" dur="5.55">in a row and why would the median income</text>
  <text start="636.889" dur="5.13">start to fall could that be because most</text>

  <text start="701.9" dur="6.15">happens when this entire system goes on</text>
  <text start="704.84" dur="6.78">if EBT went down think about the number</text>
  <text start="708.05" dur="8">of people that could not afford food at</text>
  <text start="711.62" dur="7.74">this time and what that would lead to</text>
  <text start="716.05" dur="5.29">now since we know the economy is not</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="5.07">doing well and we know we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>

  <text start="735.26" dur="6.12">this and the government is playing a</text>
  <text start="738.14" dur="5.22">yo-yo game of oh we&amp;#39;ve made a deal we</text>
  <text start="741.38" dur="3.9">haven&amp;#39;t made a deal oh we&amp;#39;ve close to a</text>

  <text start="745.28" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="746.63" dur="6.6">throughout the process and dr. Paul</text>
  <text start="751.07" dur="5.31">Craig Roberts said you know if we go</text>
  <text start="753.23" dur="5.37">past the October 17th date the president</text>
  <text start="756.38" dur="5.16">could enact the executive order</text>
  <text start="758.6" dur="5.49">declaring a national emergency where he</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="4.86">gets full control and does not have to</text>
  <text start="764.09" dur="5.76">deal with Congress can take control of</text>
  <text start="766.4" dur="5.58">an enact other executive orders like</text>
  <text start="769.85" dur="4.56">taking control of all communications</text>

  <text start="781.19" dur="5.34">raise the debt ceiling him self and</text>
  <text start="784.13" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of financial</text>
  <text start="786.53" dur="8.01">institutions out there saying that this</text>
  <text start="790.7" dur="5.58">could go past the 17th date now I am</text>
  <text start="794.54" dur="3.39">positive that they&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="796.28" dur="4.65">debt ceiling because they really have no</text>
  <text start="797.93" dur="6.06">choice at this point what I&amp;#39;m concerned</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="6.39">with is will they do it before the 17th</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="5.55">or after and if it&amp;#39;s after</text>
  <text start="807.32" dur="4.26">we are going to have to see what is</text>
  <text start="809.54" dur="4.92">going to happen here because that gives</text>
  <text start="811.58" dur="5.37">the president the opportunity to declare</text>
  <text start="814.46" dur="4.89">some type of natural national emergency</text>
  <text start="816.95" dur="6.12">because the government is completely</text>
  <text start="819.35" dur="5.99">shut down and in default and that of</text>
  <text start="823.07" dur="6.84">course is according to the government</text>
  <text start="825.34" dur="6.64">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that JP</text>
  <text start="829.91" dur="5.13">Morgan and I reported this a little</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="6.24">while back fidelity was dropping all</text>

  <text start="838.22" dur="6.9">we see JP Morgan is dropping its</text>

  <text start="1012.62" dur="4.35">rising up and fighting back and this is</text>
  <text start="1015.44" dur="4.53">why we&amp;#39;re having the drone attacks</text>

  <text start="1045.89" dur="7.77">now is China at the same time is making</text>
  <text start="1049.31" dur="9.03">deals all over the globe to use the yuan</text>

  <text start="1068.6" dur="4.38">back to the United States guess what</text>
  <text start="1070.61" dur="3.64">happens there are more dollars in</text>
  <text start="1072.98" dur="4.09">circulation</text>
  <text start="1074.25" dur="6.72">that means there will be inflation here</text>

  <text start="1096.57" dur="6.47">shrinking in size their price is staying</text>
  <text start="1099.6" dur="6.24">the same but they&amp;#39;re giving you less and</text>
  <text start="1103.04" dur="6.55">through this common core they are</text>
  <text start="1105.84" dur="6.78">teaching the students to accept the</text>
  <text start="1109.59" dur="7.74">climate change theory which we know is</text>
  <text start="1112.62" dur="6.9">not true they are convincing them that</text>
  <text start="1117.33" dur="4.59">they are responsible for what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1756.48" dur="4.89">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="1759.21" dur="4.89">because they understand that china is</text>
