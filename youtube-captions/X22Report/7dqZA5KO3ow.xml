  <text start="140.41" dur="5.46">going to happen we know the vote will be</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="6.63">rigged just like the vote in Scotland</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="6.21">and basically nothing will happen at</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="4.38">this point because they are in control</text>
  <text start="152.08" dur="5.28">right now the elites the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="5.07">central bankers they have the control</text>

  <text start="231.53" dur="6.209">area is different but this starts to</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="5.91">spread it&amp;#39;s like a cancer and its</text>
  <text start="237.739" dur="5.131">spreading across the country it starts</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.89">in one little area nobody notices then</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="4.35">it spreads to another area people take</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="3.06">notice we notice that houses are staying</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.2">on the market longer and longer and</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="4.949">right now the San Francisco market well</text>

  <text start="253.489" dur="7.651">fall apart there there are a ton of</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="8.37">houses in the pipeline which means</text>
  <text start="261.14" dur="9.42">permits are filed shovels are ready and</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="9.51">we see the tech sector falling apart so</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="6.18">this is not a good combination and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="4.89">starting to hear rumblings on a San</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="7.71">Francisco that the housing market there</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="8.07">is reached its full inflated pneus if</text>

  <text start="287.03" dur="8.31">ready to pop so what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="4.441">right now is venture capital is drying</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="4.11">up their wares</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="4.59">to see the heavy jobs the peak heavy</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="5.33">jobs that were created in the entire</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="6.66">area while that&amp;#39;s coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="6.79">they&amp;#39;re continually building we saw this</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="4.86">back in 2007-2008 what everything</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="3.93">started to fall apart and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="4.86">seeing it in many different areas if you</text>
  <text start="315.5" dur="4.08">look at the East you look at the South</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="3.96">you look at the Midwest you look at the</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="3.99">West we&amp;#39;re starting to see in many</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="3.69">different areas people have their homes</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="3.78">for sale they can&amp;#39;t sell them that</text>
  <text start="325.73" dur="4.74">coming down in price there on the market</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="4.83">longer and longer now of course this is</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="3.23">then going to spread to other areas just</text>
  <text start="332.18" dur="3.87">like we saw back in two thousand seven</text>
  <text start="333.7" dur="3.79">remember when California was hit people</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="5.42">were just walking out of their homes</text>

  <text start="345.31" dur="6.31">they couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with the amount of</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="6.66">sales but six to eight months later</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="5.76">guess what happened it spread to all</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="4.74">these different areas and those areas of</text>
  <text start="357.38" dur="4.98">course most of it was speculation came</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="6.27">to a screeching halt and the entire</text>

  <text start="465.64" dur="5.79">now is imploding and it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="469.42" dur="5.91">as time goes on we see the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="6.93">Index hovering around 332 it moved up a</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="5.15">measly three points so we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="4.95">hovering around the three hundreds or so</text>
  <text start="480.48" dur="7.12">not really moving anywhere we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="483.31" dur="7.49">seeing huge gains to 500 600 700 to</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="6.57">basically where the norm was in the last</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="6.88">couple of years even during the Great</text>
  <text start="494.17" dur="5.22">Recession it was better this should tell</text>
  <text start="497.68" dur="5.16">you something at this point and we know</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="6.15">there are more ships coming online which</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="5.64">is not going to help the situation but</text>
  <text start="505.54" dur="5.52">of course as time goes on the US</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="4.53">government the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="3.72">going to say this is the new normal the</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="4.68">Baltic Dry Index should be around 400</text>
  <text start="514.78" dur="5.79">points well this wasn&amp;#39;t the new normal</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.5">until now so this means we&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="520.57" dur="3.57">in a recovery because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="3.98">convince us that real estate the way it</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="4.95">works right now this is the new normal</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="4.3">manufacturing this is the new normal all</text>
  <text start="529.09" dur="3.96">those people that are out of work that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="4.44">the new normal so everything is the new</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="4.8">normal basically what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="4.65">this is what a collapse looks like now</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="7.38">the GAO the Government Accountability</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="9.51">Office says that the u.s. financials are</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="5.37">complete mess the Department of Defense</text>

  <text start="554.37" dur="4.57">coupled with the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="5.34">out-of-control debt and spending that</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="4.44">they can&amp;#39;t make heads or tail of this</text>
  <text start="561.45" dur="3.1">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="4.17">useless</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="7.289">this point and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="7.229">dangers lie ahead problems in the</text>
  <text start="571.839" dur="5.841">economy right now they say might lead to</text>
  <text start="574.779" dur="8.191">another economic downturn or a</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="8.589">large-scale disaster what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="6.96">right now is the US government central</text>
  <text start="586.269" dur="5.731">bankers trying to keep this system alive</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re using every accounting trick in</text>
  <text start="592" dur="5.91">the books actually if this was a</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="5.91">corporation and they were auditing the</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="4.71">corporation like the United States which</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.369">is a corporation most of the people in</text>
  <text start="602.62" dur="9.69">there right now would be going to jail</text>
  <text start="605.589" dur="8.19">for falsifying financial documents so we</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="6.24">would see most of these people behind</text>
  <text start="613.779" dur="8.071">bars at this point but again they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="618.55" dur="4.979">control they make their own rules</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="3.39">actually the US government central</text>
  <text start="623.529" dur="7.111">bankers have different rules than the</text>
  <text start="625.24" dur="10.469">people and we see right now that as time</text>
  <text start="630.64" dur="7.83">goes on the economy continually gets</text>
  <text start="635.709" dur="5.851">worse as we go throughout this year now</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="4.38">I know the market sewer to 300 plus</text>
  <text start="641.56" dur="3.33">points which is absolutely meaningless</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="5.1">because the market doesn&amp;#39;t really tell</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="6.3">us how the economy is doing because</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="5.46">right before the crash in 2008 the</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="4.769">market was doing perfectly fine it was</text>
  <text start="653.41" dur="6.81">at all time new highs and then all of a</text>
  <text start="655.959" dur="5.701">sudden it came crashing down and then it</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="3.15">bounced back up and they said everything</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="6.15">was fine and then it came crashing down</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="7.02">once again but the economy was in bad</text>
  <text start="667.81" dur="7.019">shape way before that and this is what</text>
  <text start="670.39" dur="9.35">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now Russia Russia has</text>
  <text start="674.829" dur="4.911">become the world&amp;#39;s largest buyer of gold</text>
  <text start="679.829" dur="10.69">so right now the Bank of Russia has</text>
  <text start="685.39" dur="9.21">purchased a lot of gold and basically</text>
  <text start="690.519" dur="7.711">they are preparing for the demise of the</text>
  <text start="694.6" dur="5.45">dollar China is preparing for the</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="9.09">eyes of the dollar we have to remember</text>
  <text start="700.05" dur="11.68">the yuan back gold pricing comes into</text>
  <text start="707.32" dur="7.86">effect in April now we&amp;#39;ll things</text>
  <text start="711.73" dur="6.21">immediately change in April most likely</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="6.51">not most likely it will take a couple of</text>
  <text start="717.94" dur="6.42">months but this is the start and most</text>
  <text start="721.69" dur="6.72">likely will see gold inch up and then</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="6">skyrocket up and this is why if you</text>
  <text start="728.41" dur="4.95">haven&amp;#39;t already I would get some</text>
  <text start="730.36" dur="4.32">precious metals I would get silver if</text>
  <text start="733.36" dur="4.11">you can&amp;#39;t afford gold if you can afford</text>
  <text start="734.68" dur="4.62">Goldfine get gold if you can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="737.47" dur="6.03">silver you can get junk silver you can</text>
  <text start="739.3" dur="6.54">get copper just something to have to</text>
  <text start="743.5" dur="6.72">have a little bit of insurance to ensure</text>
  <text start="745.84" dur="6.66">your wealth basically because you know</text>
  <text start="750.22" dur="5.13">once the dollar D values it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="752.5" dur="7.17">be worth basically whatever the paper is</text>
  <text start="755.35" dur="6.42">worth nothing and this is going to</text>
