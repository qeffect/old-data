  <text start="237.88" dur="5.1">readjust how they made their monthly</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="6.03">payments and spread those out even</text>
  <text start="242.98" dur="5.61">longer so they can just get by and once</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="4.08">this thing starts to spread and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="4.5">talking about the collapse everyone in</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.16">every single country is going to have</text>

  <text start="268.03" dur="5.66">prep because when this time period comes</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="5.33">you want to make sure that you have</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="4.08">and you can feed your family you want to</text>

  <text start="295.53" dur="5.55">consistently since 2010 marking the</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="6.21">longest period and a half a century real</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="5.79">wage growth has fallen to a minus 2.2</text>
  <text start="304.17" dur="4.89">percent since the first quarter of 2010</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="5.22">earnings have been pushed down due to</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="4.86">low productivity growth within the</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="5.64">economy and we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="6.36">every place people can&amp;#39;t get by things</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="4.26">are getting very expensive wages are not</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="4.2">going up they&amp;#39;re actually staying the</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="3.87">same or actually decreasing and this is</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="4.68">what everyone is saying especially those</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="5.61">people who are unemployed and had a full</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.08">time job making a nice salary now can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="3.36">find a job and they&amp;#39;re taking a</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="3.06">part-time job or they&amp;#39;ve taken a</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="3.21">full-time job because they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="4.02">anything else and they&amp;#39;re taking a</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="4.86">reduced salary so there it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="5.04">for these people to make it through and</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="4.86">this is why in the UK people are diving</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="4.65">into their savings to make ends meet and</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re getting payday loans to pay for</text>
  <text start="350.01" dur="7.83">their rent or mortgage now in Spain the</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="6.9">banks are seeing more bad loans and they</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="5.84">are surging and they have risen to</text>
  <text start="361.14" dur="5.97">another 20 percent or so in</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="5.62">non-performing loans and this is just</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="5.52">getting out of control right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="5.64">seeing the banks they are having a</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.5">shortfall they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="4.26">revenue coming in from these loans</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re reporting more and more bad</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="5.16">loans and this is happening in every</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="4.14">single area wherever there&amp;#39;s a private</text>
  <text start="384.36" dur="3.57">western central bank yes there are</text>
  <text start="386.04" dur="5.25">countries that are taking a little bit</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="6.33">longer like Germany but it always starts</text>
  <text start="391.29" dur="4.8">off with certain countries just like the</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="5.22">real estate market in the United States</text>
  <text start="396.09" dur="6.48">every place didn&amp;#39;t see the turmoil and</text>
  <text start="399.48" dur="5.58">back in 2008 because what I can remember</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="4.47">is when I was trying to sell my home up</text>
  <text start="405.06" dur="5.91">in New York</text>
  <text start="407.04" dur="5.82">real estate was dead but in Florida real</text>
  <text start="410.97" dur="3.87">estate was still booming it took about</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="4.47">six to eight months for it to catch up</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="4.98">the same thing is happening with the</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="5.43">collapse it started out in Greece it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="5.55">spread to Spain it&amp;#39;s spread to Italy</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="5.72">it&amp;#39;s spread to spread to Portugal than</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="5.73">to Cyprus UK&amp;#39;s feeling at Germany</text>
  <text start="428.48" dur="5.14">unemployment starting to go up we can</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="4.38">see how this is all affecting every</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="3.78">single country right now now in the</text>
  <text start="435.48" dur="4.07">United States of course we have the</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="4.8">illusion but people are definitely</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="5.47">starting to feel it more and more people</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="5.07">are becoming unemployed people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="5.07">find work mourn people more people are</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="5.79">going on food stamps and it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="5.97">for people to make ends meet and how do</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="6.54">we know this well listen the real</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="7.71">disposable income fell the most in the</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="6.93">last 40 years and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="5.19">real disposable personal income drops by</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="5.73">0.2 percent from a month earlier and</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="5.1">plummets by 2.7 percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="5.22">the biggest collapse since the semi</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="5.46">depression in 1974 there is something</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="3.87">wrong because if you think about it and</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="4.41">you think about all the propaganda</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="4.92">coming out of the government you would</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="4.26">think that things are going well why</text>
  <text start="486.27" dur="6.12">well the unemployment rate has come down</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="6.9">to 6.7% but people have less money there</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="5.64">are less sales in the stores there are</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="8.1">less sales in the real estate market why</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="8.97">are retail housing all declining why are</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="6.09">people going why are people why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="507" dur="3.63">they have enough disposable income to</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="4.86">pay for things</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="7.65">something is happening now again we know</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="6.8">during the holiday season the sales of</text>
  <text start="518.28" dur="6.15">every single store was pretty much</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="4.87">horrific we see stores closing as soon</text>
  <text start="524.43" dur="3.72">as the holiday season was over we saw</text>
  <text start="525.81" dur="4.17">Macy&amp;#39;s come out we saw JCPenney come out</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="4.17">and most of these stores said oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="3.63">closing stores laying off people Target</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="3.12">said the were laying off people</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="4.02">Arup Estelle was out there saying</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="4.06">they&amp;#39;re closing about 175 stores and</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="7.08">more and more why because people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="8.04">have the money but the question is how</text>
  <text start="546.58" dur="5.34">did the people pay for this Christmas</text>
  <text start="550" dur="4.92">season well it wasn&amp;#39;t from the</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="8.16">disposable income everyone went into</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="8.04">their savings to buy gifts right now the</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="6.83">American people went through forty six</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="8.57">billion in savings to fund the December</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="7.9">purchases and this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="7.12">finally the data means that according to</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="5.94">the b8b ei in December US consumers</text>
  <text start="578.65" dur="5.25">funded some 46 billion in spending</text>
  <text start="580.75" dur="5.85">through burning down their savings as of</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="7.77">December 31st 2013 total personal</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="8.07">savings left are down to 495 billion</text>
  <text start="591.67" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s how they paid for this Christmas</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="7.2">season because those people who are</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="7.35">unemployed underemployed had no money</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="4.62">except whatever was in the savings and</text>
  <text start="604.03" dur="4.86">they use whatever they had to pay for</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="5.19">this Christmas season and what we saw</text>
  <text start="608.89" dur="5.97">was they just bought a little bit and</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="6.75">this is why we saw sales decline now</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="5.73">coming into this year 2014 what do you</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="4.74">think is going to happen do you think</text>
  <text start="620.59" dur="6.36">sales are going to rise or do you think</text>
  <text start="623.17" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re going to quickly start to fall</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="4.5">well I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right now</text>
  <text start="628.39" dur="6.57">it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse and they</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="6.21">know this because Walmart is already out</text>
  <text start="634.96" dur="4.08">there saying well our sales are down and</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re going to blame this on the weather</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re gonna blame this on the food</text>
  <text start="640.84" dur="4.98">stamps and again they blame everything</text>
  <text start="644.02" dur="4.29">on the weather what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="645.82" dur="5.58">in the spring it&amp;#39;s too warm it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="5.01">sunny it&amp;#39;s ridiculous the reason why</text>
  <text start="651.4" dur="3.81">this is happening is because people</text>
  <text start="653.32" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t have the money and my next</text>
  <text start="655.21" dur="4.23">question is they&amp;#39;re blaming it on the</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="5.73">food stamps so you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me</text>
  <text start="659.44" dur="6.21">this entire store of Walmart all their</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.7">sales are just based on food and they</text>
  <text start="665.65" dur="6.21">lost that much just on food purchases</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="4.8">from the food stamp program it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="671.86" dur="5.64">make sense</text>
  <text start="673.6" dur="6.75">the reason why Walmart is not doing well</text>
  <text start="677.5" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s because people are not going out</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="4.71">and buying the products in the store</text>
  <text start="682.75" dur="6.24">because they do not have the disposable</text>
  <text start="685.06" dur="5.43">income it&amp;#39;s that simple now everyone was</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="3.06">like well the reason why the</text>
  <text start="690.49" dur="3.09">brick-and-mortar stores aren&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="3.56">well during the holiday seasons and now</text>
  <text start="693.58" dur="5.04">is because everyone&amp;#39;s buying online</text>
  <text start="695.61" dur="5.89">that&amp;#39;s what everyone is doing and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.62" dur="3.75">why the brick-and-mortar stores are</text>
  <text start="701.5" dur="5.52">doing poorly</text>
  <text start="702.37" dur="8.04">well Amazon is not doing well at all if</text>
  <text start="707.02" dur="6.03">this was true then everyone that Amazon</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="4.65">would be you know up sales would be up</text>
  <text start="713.05" dur="4.02">things would be great people would have</text>
  <text start="715.06" dur="4.02">money people are working everything</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="4.62">would be fantastic and guess what they</text>
  <text start="719.08" dur="7.89">can&amp;#39;t blame online sales on the weather</text>
  <text start="721.69" dur="7.95">but revenue for Amazon of twenty five</text>
  <text start="726.97" dur="5.58">point five nine billion it missed the</text>
  <text start="729.64" dur="6.06">expectations of twenty six billion so it</text>
  <text start="732.55" dur="6.93">was down net sales was around twenty two</text>
  <text start="735.7" dur="6.39">percent the lowest in the year below the</text>
  <text start="739.48" dur="5.61">26 percent in quarter three but if I</text>
  <text start="742.09" dur="6.6">remember correctly unemployment was</text>
  <text start="745.09" dur="6.36">higher in q3 than it was in q4 because</text>
  <text start="748.69" dur="5.13">remember in q4 unemployment came down to</text>
  <text start="751.45" dur="6.47">six point seven percent doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="753.82" dur="9.66">sense and if we look to last year in</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="8.95">2012 it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the sales are worse it</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="5.49">was twenty three percent a year ago and</text>
  <text start="766.87" dur="4.38">now it&amp;#39;s twenty two percent how can that</text>
  <text start="768.97" dur="4.29">possibly be but if you look at Amazon</text>
  <text start="771.25" dur="4.86">they employ about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="5.45">seventeen thousand people up from a</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="5.81">hundred nine from a quarter ago and</text>
  <text start="778.71" dur="6.37">sales are going the opposite direction</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="5.44">so what does that tell you they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="785.08" dur="4.14">to start laying off some people here</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to happen because as</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="5.67">time goes on sales are not going to get</text>
  <text start="792.58" dur="3.96">better people are going to have less and</text>
  <text start="794.89" dur="5.61">less money because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="5.7">the unemployment inflation GDP all these</text>
  <text start="800.5" dur="3.75">calculations that the government and the</text>
  <text start="802.24" dur="4.68">federal at you are completely</text>
  <text start="804.25" dur="4.649">manipulated and what are we seeing with</text>

  <text start="1449.649" dur="3.721">biological weapons to put on missiles</text>
  <text start="1451.69" dur="4.05">and they&amp;#39;re continually building this</text>
  <text start="1453.37" dur="4.65">case just like they did right before the</text>
  <text start="1455.74" dur="3.63">false flag event in August they kept</text>
  <text start="1458.02" dur="3.509">saying that he&amp;#39;s been using chemical</text>
  <text start="1459.37" dur="4.65">weapons and you saw him use chemical</text>
  <text start="1461.529" dur="3.931">weapons and of course we know it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1464.02" dur="5.129">from Assad it was from the rebels and</text>
  <text start="1465.46" dur="5.459">they did this um before August and then</text>
  <text start="1469.149" dur="3.721">leading up to August they did it again</text>
  <text start="1470.919" dur="3.63">and they said okay they passed the</text>
  <text start="1472.87" dur="3.07">redline and now we&amp;#39;re going in well</text>
  <text start="1474.549" dur="3.701">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="1475.94" dur="6.03">right now and US Secretary of State John</text>
  <text start="1478.25" dur="5.879">Kerry said on Friday that Syria had no</text>
  <text start="1481.97" dur="4.439">excuse for delays in ridding itself of</text>
  <text start="1484.129" dur="4.8">chemical weapons and urged it to move</text>
  <text start="1486.409" dur="5.071">very rapidly to allow them to be shipped</text>
  <text start="1488.929" dur="4.801">out of the country every indication we</text>
  <text start="1491.48" dur="5.399">have is that there is no legitimate</text>
  <text start="1493.73" dur="5.399">reason why that the removal is not</text>
  <text start="1496.879" dur="4.621">happening now Kerry told a news</text>
  <text start="1499.129" dur="4.5">conference we want the Syrian regime to</text>
  <text start="1501.5" dur="4.649">live up to its obligation and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1503.629" dur="4.38">critical that very rapidly all those</text>
  <text start="1506.149" dur="4.201">chemical weapons are removed from there</text>
  <text start="1508.009" dur="4.62">twelve or so sites to the one site in</text>
  <text start="1510.35" dur="5.279">the port to be prepared for shipment out</text>
  <text start="1512.629" dur="4.741">of Syria if President Assad failed to</text>
  <text start="1515.629" dur="3.991">meet the obligations Kerry said the</text>
  <text start="1517.37" dur="4.169">United States and its allies would meet</text>
  <text start="1519.62" dur="3.99">to consider which options we deem</text>
  <text start="1521.539" dur="5.791">necessary at the point to proceed</text>
  <text start="1523.61" dur="5.669">forward and they are right now basically</text>
  <text start="1527.33" dur="3.99">saying listen if you can&amp;#39;t get these out</text>
  <text start="1529.279" dur="3.691">and they are behind schedule</text>
  <text start="1531.32" dur="3.15">because what&amp;#39;s happening is the rebels</text>
  <text start="1532.97" dur="3.809">are blocking them they&amp;#39;re very hard to</text>
  <text start="1534.47" dur="3.63">get through the the streets with these</text>
  <text start="1536.779" dur="3.331">chemical weapons it&amp;#39;s very dangerous</text>
  <text start="1538.1" dur="4.189">they&amp;#39;re they they have all these weapons</text>
  <text start="1540.11" dur="4.98">and they have to be disposed of now</text>
  <text start="1542.289" dur="5.311">there was an official report that came</text>
  <text start="1545.09" dur="5.16">out saying that the militants</text>
  <text start="1547.6" dur="5.5">unsuccessfully targeted a chemical armed</text>
  <text start="1550.25" dur="6.059">shipment prior to its removal from Syria</text>
  <text start="1553.1" dur="5.97">this week you see what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="1556.309" dur="4.171">now during the removal of the second</text>
  <text start="1559.07" dur="3.39">consignment of chemical weapons on</text>
  <text start="1560.48" dur="5.12">January 27 2014</text>
  <text start="1562.46" dur="6.36">the convoy carrying them was attacked by</text>
  <text start="1565.6" dur="6.85">militants and the attack was defeated</text>
  <text start="1568.82" dur="5.219">this is their you they&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="1572.45" dur="5.099">militants the rebels the paid</text>
  <text start="1574.039" dur="5.551">mercenaries make sure the timeline of</text>
  <text start="1577.549" dur="5.49">this the removal of the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1579.59" dur="6.15">is slowed down and make sure that you</text>
  <text start="1583.039" dur="4.98">can capture some of these because we or</text>
  <text start="1585.74" dur="4.38">delay them as much as you possibly can</text>
  <text start="1588.019" dur="5.76">because we are building the case to</text>
  <text start="1590.12" dur="6.899">strike into Syria somehow some way and</text>
  <text start="1593.779" dur="7.081">they&amp;#39;ve been building this up and this</text>
  <text start="1597.019" dur="7.26">is their entire plan now we understand</text>
  <text start="1600.86" dur="5.759">that they&amp;#39;ve tried a false flag event</text>
  <text start="1604.279" dur="4.301">out in Syria the American people the</text>
  <text start="1606.619" dur="3.67">Congress no one bought it the war</text>
  <text start="1608.58" dur="3.569">old said and we don&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="1610.289" dur="3.27">where&amp;#39;s your proof they could never come</text>
  <text start="1612.149" dur="5.101">up with any type of proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1613.559" dur="6.661">that Assad actually used it and then of</text>
  <text start="1617.25" dur="4.83">course MIT came out and said listen this</text>
  <text start="1620.22" dur="3.929">missile where the government was</text>
  <text start="1622.08" dur="4.38">positioned that there&amp;#39;s no way they</text>
  <text start="1624.149" dur="5.071">fired this it didn&amp;#39;t have the range it</text>
  <text start="1626.46" dur="5.459">must have come from the rebels and we</text>
  <text start="1629.22" dur="4.86">can see that you know this is turning</text>
  <text start="1631.919" dur="6">out to be true this was a false flag</text>
  <text start="1634.08" dur="5.55">event now we understand they are</text>
  <text start="1637.919" dur="4.14">becoming desperate they are losing</text>
  <text start="1639.63" dur="6.63">ground in the Middle East they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1642.059" dur="6.301">nowhere with Syria and Iran is taking a</text>
  <text start="1646.26" dur="3.69">very long time to iron out these peace</text>
  <text start="1648.36" dur="5.58">talks I mean to infiltrate their banks</text>
  <text start="1649.95" dur="6">and they are losing a lot of time here</text>
  <text start="1653.94" dur="3.39">and they&amp;#39;re becoming desperate because</text>
  <text start="1655.95" dur="4.74">they know they need to get into these</text>
  <text start="1657.33" dur="6.03">countries to prop up the US dollar for a</text>
  <text start="1660.69" dur="4.199">little bit longer and they believe that</text>
  <text start="1663.36" dur="4.14">if they get into these countries</text>
  <text start="1664.889" dur="5.88">everything will be alright and we know</text>
  <text start="1667.5" dur="6.51">it will not because Russia and China</text>
  <text start="1670.769" dur="4.981">back both of these countries and this is</text>
  <text start="1674.01" dur="4.379">why they just haven&amp;#39;t stormed in and</text>
  <text start="1675.75" dur="6.539">taken over these countries so they need</text>
  <text start="1678.389" dur="5.821">to look for a reason to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="1682.289" dur="5.61">they just can&amp;#39;t go in there because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1684.21" dur="5.939">a sovereign nation so what are they</text>
  <text start="1687.899" dur="4.5">doing they had the peace talks because</text>
  <text start="1690.149" dur="4.321">again they&amp;#39;re showing you that we want</text>
  <text start="1692.399" dur="4.02">peace and they&amp;#39;re going to come out and</text>
  <text start="1694.47" dur="4.049">say that you know Assad government they</text>
  <text start="1696.419" dur="4.561">didn&amp;#39;t cooperate the peace talks ended</text>
  <text start="1698.519" dur="5.25">they couldn&amp;#39;t do anything we were there</text>
  <text start="1700.98" dur="5.37">we wanted peace and look and now of</text>
  <text start="1703.769" dur="4.41">course clapper the liar who lied to the</text>
  <text start="1706.35" dur="5.069">American people is telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="1708.179" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re creating biological weapons they</text>
  <text start="1711.419" dur="4.801">have information that they&amp;#39;re terrorists</text>
  <text start="1714.059" dur="4.261">inside of Syria that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1716.22" dur="4.799">attack the United States they are</text>
  <text start="1718.32" dur="5.969">completely building this up it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1721.019" dur="6.601">in front of us and we understand that</text>
  <text start="1724.289" dur="6.86">they&amp;#39;re the superbowls going on there is</text>
  <text start="1727.62" dur="7.08">speculation that something might occur</text>
  <text start="1731.149" dur="5.41">we&amp;#39;ve also seen cyber attacks with the</text>
  <text start="1734.7" dur="3.3">Syrian electronic army they keep using</text>
  <text start="1736.559" dur="4.561">them because they want everyone to know</text>

  <text start="1741.12" dur="6.15">can see how this is</text>
  <text start="1742.26" dur="11.22">playing right now now today we saw that</text>
  <text start="1747.27" dur="8.67">the in in the Super Bowl and the hotels</text>
  <text start="1753.48" dur="5.3">surrounding their there were envelopes</text>
  <text start="1755.94" dur="5.4">delivered with white powder and again</text>
  <text start="1758.78" dur="4.78">this white powder turned out to be</text>
  <text start="1761.34" dur="4.98">cornstarch or some type of baking soda</text>
  <text start="1763.56" dur="7.53">but the whole purpose of this was to</text>
  <text start="1766.32" dur="7.05">keep everyone in fear to make it seem</text>
  <text start="1771.09" dur="4.56">like there is terrorists out there even</text>
  <text start="1773.37" dur="5.1">though there wasn&amp;#39;t they want everyone</text>
