  <text start="53.329" dur="5.25">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.839" dur="5.22">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.579" dur="6.86">episode 1604 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="6.06">29th 2018 and the tot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.439" dur="4.811">central bankers begin to panic is the</text>
  <text start="68.119" dur="5.131">u.s. leaving the World Trade</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="5.7">Organization let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="5.13">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="5.61">about consumer confidence before and</text>
  <text start="78.38" dur="6.629">right now consumer confidence the hope</text>
  <text start="81.56" dur="6.18">part of it has slid to five-month lows</text>
  <text start="85.009" dur="4.831">and the reason for this is that people</text>
  <text start="87.74" dur="3.84">are seeing inflation right now and</text>
  <text start="89.84" dur="4.11">people are a little bit nervous and</text>
  <text start="91.58" dur="6.3">people are being laid off and people are</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="6.839">still with those low-paying jobs and we</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="6.299">know that wages are falling we know that</text>
  <text start="100.789" dur="6.42">the savings rate is falling and the real</text>
  <text start="104.179" dur="4.8">economy is breaking and falling apart</text>
  <text start="107.209" dur="4.531">right in front of our eyes I mean that</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="4.621">is a fact we&amp;#39;ve been following it we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="4.23">been looking at it we&amp;#39;ve been monitoring</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="5.609">it and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="115.97" dur="5.94">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that when</text>
  <text start="119.209" dur="5.401">they asked about the US economy with</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="4.5">trade you know would more trade or less</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="4.679">trade with other countries be better for</text>
  <text start="126.41" dur="5.46">the US economy and the people said yes</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="5.641">more trade with other countries would be</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="4.71">better and they really didn&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="4.25">about the tariffs and things like that</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="5.76">and what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="139.18" dur="7.41">remember most of our manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="7.259">been moved out of this country the</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.96">globalists the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="149.599" dur="3.78">pushing their agenda for a very long</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="3.6">time where they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="153.379" dur="4.681">everything out of this country it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="5.85">happen yesterday or last year or even</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="6.3">during Obama it happened a long time ago</text>
  <text start="161" dur="7.2">and it was a very slow methodical push</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="7.379">to push everything out of the US and to</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="6.53">prepare the world for a one world</text>
  <text start="171.739" dur="7.261">government one world type of currency</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="7.12">situation and we know right now that the</text>
  <text start="179" dur="4.77">move is to break up this global system</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="3.06">to break up the central banking system</text>
  <text start="183.77" dur="2.7">and</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="4.98">we can see it in many different areas</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="4.77">just like the agreement of NAFTA where</text>
  <text start="189.89" dur="3.39">Trump wanted to get rid of that but</text>
  <text start="191.24" dur="3.93">again it&amp;#39;s very difficult just to say oh</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="3.54">let&amp;#39;s get rid of it because Congress</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="3.63">would have to get involved with this so</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re renegotiating NAFTA now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.8" dur="4.65">been going on for quite a while</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="4.83">TPP was completely struck down and we</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="3.9">know that Trump would like to get rid of</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="5.67">the World Trade Organization which we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="207.35" dur="5.01">get into in just a minute but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="5.88">seeing is all these different things</text>
  <text start="212.36" dur="7.56">make up the globalist agenda and piece</text>
  <text start="216.74" dur="5.94">by piece by having bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="219.92" dur="5.13">and doing other things by getting rid of</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="4.95">these other trade deals it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="4.44">ripped apart and the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="5.82">globalists they&amp;#39;re panicking right now</text>
  <text start="229.49" dur="6.3">you hear the calls from the IMF the biz</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re all out there saying there might</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="4.35">be an economic shock Europe needs to</text>
  <text start="238.13" dur="4.89">come together put put together a rainy</text>
  <text start="240.14" dur="5.16">day funny fun the biz is out there</text>
  <text start="243.02" dur="3.72">saying listen there might be a couple of</text>
  <text start="245.3" dur="3.45">banks out here that might be</text>
  <text start="246.74" dur="4.44">manipulating their books the same thing</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="4.97">that Lehman did and they&amp;#39;re not as</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="4.95">strong as they are saying they are</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="5.139">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they are</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="5.16">separating themselves from the banking</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="5.221">system right now yes they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="261.29" dur="4.44">banking system but once again they want</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="5.13">to make it look like they&amp;#39;re above it</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="4.95">and keep their organization intact and</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t care what happens to little</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="3.45">banks here or there if they go under it</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="4.26">makes no difference to them as long as</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="5.34">their system the creation of currency is</text>
  <text start="276.89" dur="4.86">intact and the control of countries is</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="5.76">intact that&amp;#39;s what they care about</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="4.77">now in the United States we can see from</text>
  <text start="285.23" dur="2.97">many different indicators and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="3.99">looking at all different indicators</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="4.29">showing us that this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="3.45">is breaking down the numbers that are</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="3.66">being thrown out by the government</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated and what</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="5.61">I think is happening is that Trump with</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="5.19">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re using the central</text>
  <text start="301.76" dur="5.1">bank the globalist system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="5.13">pushing it to the extreme to bring down</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="3.6">the system this is why the corporate</text>
  <text start="309.26" dur="3.09">media and the rest are having a</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="4.32">difficult time you know saying that oh</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="4.14">this is no good because if they started</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="3.64">to say that oh these numbers are</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="5.89">manipulated these aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.42" dur="7.83">good numbers it would refer back to what</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="6.09">Obama did what Clinton did what Bush did</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="4.62">and it would go back in time so they</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.56">really can&amp;#39;t call these numbers out</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="5.49">because they haven&amp;#39;t really changed</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="4.5">anything and there&amp;#39;s a reason why Trump</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="3.48">and the Patriots have done this because</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re using their system and pushing</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="5.13">it to the edge without giving them a way</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="4.89">out and their way out before was going</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="4.5">to be with some type of an event and now</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="349.47" dur="5.07">difficult to call them out on this</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="6.09">because it&amp;#39;s their system but the</text>
  <text start="354.54" dur="4.2">everyday person is feeling this I mean</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="4.5">look Toys R Us just closed down they</text>
  <text start="358.74" dur="5.19">closed their last store and 33,000</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="4.89">people are gonna be out of work and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="5.31">not just that one realtor retailer it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.91">many many retailers around the country</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="6.66">and yes they had an online presence if</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="6.48">people don&amp;#39;t have high paying jobs if</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="5.04">people don&amp;#39;t have confidence if people</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="3.45">can&amp;#39;t make ends meet they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="4.38">go out and spend money in</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="4.56">brick-and-mortar or online they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="4.23">to be very very careful on what they</text>
  <text start="387.03" dur="4.92">spend on and showing up in all different</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="5.76">areas especially retail and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="391.95" dur="6.45">just you know goods like TVs electronics</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;re also seeing it in other areas like</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="5.58">the food industry they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="402" dur="4.86">difficult time they are slowing right</text>
  <text start="403.98" dur="5.61">now traffic is drying up we also see</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="6.77">that Americans since inflation has</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="8.16">ticked up their spending is growing</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="6.21">faster than their incomes and we know</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="4.73">that the savings rate right now is</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="6.88">continually declining it has been</text>
  <text start="422.48" dur="6.4">declining since 2013 because what</text>
  <text start="426.72" dur="3.51">happens here as inflation I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="428.88" dur="3.03">about price inflation when you go to the</text>
  <text start="430.23" dur="3.32">supermarket where you go and you try to</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="6.78">purchase goods that you need every day</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="7.87">fuels going up if these things go up it</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="5.73">takes more dollars to pay for something</text>
  <text start="441.42" dur="5.49">which means people are now laying out</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="6.93">more money than they&amp;#39;re bringing in and</text>
  <text start="446.91" dur="5.28">as this continues we call this inflation</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="2.79">and hype</text>
  <text start="452.19" dur="4.8">inflation which means the value of the</text>
  <text start="454.14" dur="4.38">dollar continually declines and it</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="2.94">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much people pay you</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they raise the minimum</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="5.31">wage to $25 an hour you will never be</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="4.86">able to make ends meet and this is what</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and wages</text>
  <text start="467.91" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ve been declining and they really</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="3.12">haven&amp;#39;t been going anywhere yes they say</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="3.75">they moved up a little bit but again</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="3.51">they move up they go back down and</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ve been bantering around and</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re not really and we&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="5.7">seeing the wages that we saw back in the</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="3.71">70s remember when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="5.91">standard and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="6.04">housing was repriced incomes were</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="4.68">repriced interest rates were very high</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="5.73">and everything had to be redone because</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="4.35">they were creating so much currency that</text>
  <text start="498.6" dur="4.11">the value of the currency was declining</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="4.7">and we saw inflation and they had high</text>
  <text start="502.71" dur="6.06">interest rates now we&amp;#39;re on the back end</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="7.06">interest rates very low income dropping</text>
  <text start="508.77" dur="5.399">savings dropping nobody&amp;#39;s keeping money</text>
  <text start="511.92" dur="4.71">in CDs or banks because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="4.171">interest right now and we see the</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="4.26">opposite happening and this is what</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="5.31">happens at the back end of the system</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="4.19">when it&amp;#39;s dying because when we come off</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="4.29">the goaltend they were coming off a</text>
  <text start="525.08" dur="5.56">standard which was checks and balances</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="4.38">with gold now throughout this whole</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="3.27">period of time they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="4.02">currency creating debt creating currency</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="4.62">creating debt and there are no more</text>
  <text start="536.34" dur="4.17">checks and balances so everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.53" dur="4.92">starting to break apart their system is</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="6.69">designed to break apart at a certain</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="6.6">point it never lasts and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="5.52">to see PCE inflation tick up on a</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="4.98">year-to-year basis it is moving up right</text>
  <text start="552.72" dur="6.81">now and it&amp;#39;s rising at the fastest rate</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="7.44">since March 2012 now the Fed has gone</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="5.34">out and they have done stress tests on</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="3.96">all different banks and some banks</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t do that well now we know the</text>
  <text start="566.43" dur="5.7">stress tests they&amp;#39;re a bunch of BS and</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="6.21">the only reason they created this test</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="4.86">was because back in 2008 people were</text>
  <text start="575.28" dur="4.35">losing confidence in banks because they</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="4.14">needed bailouts and they needed to</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="3.24">restore confidence so they said you know</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="2.97">something will create something called a</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="2.73">stress test to let you know how the</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="3.479">banks are doing</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="5.07">and we know this is fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="587.579" dur="5.611">but they pointed to the really bad banks</text>
  <text start="590.67" dur="5.339">where they&amp;#39;re in big trouble like</text>
  <text start="593.19" dur="5.339">Deutsche Bank and many other banks well</text>
  <text start="596.009" dur="3.69">they were they didn&amp;#39;t do too well and we</text>
  <text start="598.529" dur="2.911">can see that a lot of these banks</text>
  <text start="599.699" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re buying back their stocks paying</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="6.78">out dividends and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="605.579" dur="5.281">the biz has been telling us that some of</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="5.16">these banks have been manipulating their</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="5.159">books what they&amp;#39;re showing and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="4.47">really happening is not the same and</text>
  <text start="616.019" dur="4.07">this is what happened to leave it now we</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="5.69">didn&amp;#39;t know any of this until Lehman</text>
  <text start="620.089" dur="6.451">imploded and then we saw you know other</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="5.08">banking or other insurance companies or</text>
  <text start="626.54" dur="3.279">manufacturers then they all started</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="2.82">coming out of the woodwork saying they</text>
  <text start="629.819" dur="3.45">had too much debt they couldn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="3.66">payment they couldn&amp;#39;t do anything and</text>
  <text start="633.269" dur="4.021">when then we saw AIG as for a bailout</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="4.739">the automobile industry asked for a</text>
  <text start="637.29" dur="5.099">bailout we saw Bear Stearns and many</text>
  <text start="639.839" dur="5.61">many other banks Bank of America</text>
  <text start="642.389" dur="5.76">Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase they all</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="5.461">asked for something and we see once</text>
  <text start="648.149" dur="5.55">again that we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="650.91" dur="6.06">happening just that the biz is telling</text>
  <text start="653.699" dur="6.091">us this it means that it&amp;#39;s much bigger</text>
  <text start="656.97" dur="5.28">than what they&amp;#39;re saying now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="659.79" dur="5.13">interesting we talk about minutiae and</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="4.41">how he&amp;#39;s always out there and in the</text>
  <text start="664.92" dur="3.93">beginning he said that Trump was gonna</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="5.88">look at the TPP he might even sign the</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="6.75">TPP and the u.s. might join you know</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="5.31">with the other countries well Trump came</text>
  <text start="675.6" dur="3.81">out and said no we&amp;#39;re not doing that so</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="4.89">that turned out to be fake phony and</text>
  <text start="679.41" dur="5.22">false then manoosh in came out and he</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="3.69">started to talk about all different</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="4.41">other things where he&amp;#39;s tweeting for</text>
  <text start="686.43" dur="5.279">Donald Trump and once again that turned</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="7.14">out to be fake now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="691.709" dur="8.041">and is reported by Axios saying that the</text>
  <text start="696.18" dur="6.089">Trump administration is looking to leave</text>
  <text start="699.75" dur="5.61">the World Trade Organization now we know</text>
  <text start="702.269" dur="5.731">that Trump doesn&amp;#39;t like the WTO he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="5.31">making a lot of bilateral trades minutia</text>
  <text start="708" dur="6.449">on the other hand is out there saying</text>
  <text start="710.67" dur="6.06">that this is a fake story now this is</text>
  <text start="714.449" dur="4.83">very interesting because minutiae and</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="5.25">Trump they&amp;#39;re not on the same page</text>
  <text start="719.279" dur="5.31">actually manoosh in I think is trying to</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="5.039">convince Trump for the central bank and</text>
  <text start="724.589" dur="4.531">the bankers to move him in a certain</text>
  <text start="727.019" dur="4.76">direction and I think Trump fights back</text>
  <text start="729.12" dur="7.529">and I think trumman ushion right now is</text>
  <text start="731.779" dur="6.941">trying to stop what is really happening</text>
  <text start="736.649" dur="4.8">here and I think what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="738.72" dur="4.83">is eventually just like the TPP NAFTA I</text>
  <text start="741.449" dur="4.231">think Trump is gonna want to leave the</text>
  <text start="743.55" dur="4.38">WTO I don&amp;#39;t think he thinks it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="4.17">benefit I think he thinks there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="747.93" dur="4.79">reason for this and I think that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="5.31">no reason to have a centralized trading</text>
  <text start="752.72" dur="4.659">organization and of course this is set</text>
  <text start="755.16" dur="4.979">up by the central bank the globalist to</text>
  <text start="757.379" dur="4.56">control all the countries bring them</text>
  <text start="760.139" dur="4.56">down to a certain level so they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="761.939" dur="5.25">even and we see right now it&amp;#39;s better to</text>
  <text start="764.699" dur="5.911">be diversified in having bilateral</text>
  <text start="767.189" dur="5.76">trades with each country making a deal</text>
  <text start="770.61" dur="4.5">with each country so if this deal fills</text>
  <text start="772.949" dur="6.091">apart with let&amp;#39;s say France</text>
  <text start="775.11" dur="7.56">it doesn&amp;#39;t affect anyone else and I</text>
  <text start="779.04" dur="8">think right now minuchin is either being</text>
  <text start="782.67" dur="6.719">set up and Trump is watching him and</text>
  <text start="787.04" dur="4.419">maybe he&amp;#39;s going to get rid of him</text>
  <text start="789.389" dur="4.411">because he did this with McMasters he</text>
  <text start="791.459" dur="3.93">did this with many many other people so</text>
  <text start="793.8" dur="4.31">we see right now that the central</text>
  <text start="795.389" dur="5.161">bankers the globalists they are very</text>
  <text start="798.11" dur="4.75">worried because their system is being</text>
  <text start="800.55" dur="5.19">dismantled right in front of their eyes</text>
  <text start="802.86" dur="5.43">because what is happening all of this is</text>
  <text start="805.74" dur="6.329">being done to prepare for this major</text>
  <text start="808.29" dur="6.06">transition and this transition is going</text>
  <text start="812.069" dur="4.62">to happen one way or another because the</text>
  <text start="814.35" dur="5.089">only way out of this is to destroy the</text>
  <text start="816.689" dur="6.69">globalist central banking system and</text>
  <text start="819.439" dur="6.34">once that is done then you&amp;#39;re free to</text>
  <text start="823.379" dur="5.101">move this system in any direction you</text>
  <text start="825.779" dur="4.8">want and of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not going to want this to happen</text>
  <text start="830.579" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to want their system to be</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="5.82">moved to their new system so this is</text>
  <text start="834.839" dur="4.92">where we go back to the idea of who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.11" dur="3.269">going to control the narrative just like</text>
  <text start="839.759" dur="4.14">in the 70s who controlled the narrative</text>
  <text start="841.379" dur="4.231">back then it was the globalist the</text>
  <text start="843.899" dur="4.831">central bank where they said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.61" dur="5.669">gold speculators and we need to take the</text>
  <text start="848.73" dur="4.38">dollar off gold the gold standard and</text>
  <text start="851.279" dur="3.87">they made this whole story up</text>
  <text start="853.11" dur="3.39">to make us believe that this is why this</text>
  <text start="855.149" dur="4.291">is happening this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="856.5" dur="5.579">shortages in fuel and this is why we</text>
  <text start="859.44" dur="4.41">have inflation this is why we see high</text>
  <text start="862.079" dur="4.111">interest rates and they made up this</text>
  <text start="863.85" dur="3.54">whole entire story the back story was</text>
  <text start="866.19" dur="2.82">they didn&amp;#39;t tell us that we were moving</text>
  <text start="867.39" dur="3.689">off the gold standard onto their new</text>
  <text start="869.01" dur="4.68">system the petrodollar system where they</text>
  <text start="871.079" dur="5.341">can create currency without any checks</text>
  <text start="873.69" dur="4.74">and balances so once again whoever</text>
  <text start="876.42" dur="4.26">controls the narrative is going to</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="3.93">control the next move and we can see</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="3.99">Trump in the Patriots and the central</text>
  <text start="882.36" dur="5.55">bank and the globalists they are</text>
