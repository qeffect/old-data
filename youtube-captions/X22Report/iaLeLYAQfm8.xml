  <text start="140.26" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s not enough funds to bail out the</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="3.21">insurance companies this is why they</text>
  <text start="143.77" dur="6.93">were trying to bring in 70 billion more</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="7.59">dollars and we need to understand how we</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="5.869">will know when they come up with a good</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="6.959">health care plan it&amp;#39;s very simple and</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="6.161">this is how you&amp;#39;ll know it is the best</text>
  <text start="160.239" dur="5.461">thing since sliced bread you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="5.58">to read it you don&amp;#39;t need to look into</text>
  <text start="165.7" dur="5.61">it you don&amp;#39;t need to you know have some</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="7.14">type of an analysis all you need to know</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="6.75">is one thing when the Senate run the</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="5.61">house when the president the vice</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="6.92">president all the staffers what they all</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="7.069">take it and drop what they have it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="6.41">credible that how you will know that</text>
  <text start="188.129" dur="6.901">this is good for the people otherwise</text>

  <text start="195.03" dur="5.33">waste of time</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="7.651">so when they push something forward and</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="5.05">every single one of them drops what they</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="6.209">have because it&amp;#39;s better than what they</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="8.4">have then you know every single American</text>
  <text start="209.849" dur="7.561">is going to love it that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="5.64">you have to know it&amp;#39;s that simple now</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that there</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="4.619">was a new study out there this was</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="5.27">released by the Commonwealth Fund and it</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="6.571">found that the u.s. despite spending</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.769">more money per capita than any other</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="4.8">country on the planet</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="8.08">the United States has the worst health</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="6.919">care system in the developed world now</text>
  <text start="239.879" dur="5.401">the Commonwealth Fund focused on</text>
  <text start="242.359" dur="5.201">evaluating five main areas of the health</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="4.62">care system including care process</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="6">access administrative efficiency equity</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="6.089">health care outcomes and analyze 72</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="3.899">indicators within those fields of the</text>
  <text start="255.989" dur="7.411">eleven countries included in the study</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="9.21">the u.s. ranked dead last and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="5.34">spends the most I mean this is</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="4.591">unbelievable they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="8.22">us that we have an incredible health</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="7.74">care system and we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="6.57">health insurance is no good the health</text>
  <text start="279" dur="7.979">care system everything and it shows that</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="5.79">other countries are doing it better why</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t we look at the top countries and</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.23">see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="290.729" dur="5.31">I mean look look what we&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="7.049">we&amp;#39;re listening to insurance companies</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="9.69">and they&amp;#39;re dictating what the bill</text>
  <text start="300.599" dur="7.471">should be and when you do that it</text>
  <text start="305.729" dur="5.011">doesn&amp;#39;t benefit the people it benefits</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="6.719">who those who are getting paid off by it</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="6.03">and the insurance companies this is why</text>
  <text start="314.789" dur="3.861">we&amp;#39;re having a problem because if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.13">something that great everyone</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="3.989">would be getting it even those in</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="4.109">government and when Obamacare came out</text>
  <text start="322.639" dur="6.631">if we remember everyone was exempt from</text>
  <text start="325.009" dur="7.41">it why that just tells you the entire</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="6.63">story of health care of the health</text>
  <text start="332.419" dur="5.37">insurance of everything you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="335.9" dur="6.87">anything else to know if it&amp;#39;s good or</text>
  <text start="337.789" dur="7.981">bad that right there well that&amp;#39;s it now</text>
  <text start="342.77" dur="7.619">it looks like Susan Rice was supposed to</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="8.16">testify in front of the Senate and this</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="6.681">was about the unmasking of certain</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="8.25">individuals and it looks like rice</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="5.98">cancelled her testimony she decided not</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="3.63">to do it now</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="4.619">there are rumors that there this has to</text>
  <text start="365.81" dur="4.26">be rescheduled because the Senate panel</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="4.921">wasn&amp;#39;t ready and they need to set it at</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="4.95">a different time but again we will know</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="5.88">right off the bat if this is true or not</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6.989">but it comes right on the heels of Glenn</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="5.479">Simpson canceling his testimony and you</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="4.59">have to remember he is the co-founder</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="5.081">the he&amp;#39;s the one who co-founded the</text>
  <text start="386.599" dur="6.511">opposition research firm fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="7.169">which was responsible for the dossier on</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="4.679">Trump which was debunked and shown to be</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="3.75">completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="3.861">now Simpsons cancellation in front of</text>
  <text start="399.949" dur="4.5">the Senate Intel committee appearance</text>
  <text start="401.65" dur="5.62">followed the revelations that to fusion</text>
  <text start="404.449" dur="6.72">gps associates were intimately involved</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="5.869">in a June 26 sit down with Trump jr. the</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="4.861">Russian lawyer and six other people a</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="6.431">meeting which has the appearance of a</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="7.169">political setup meant to basically</text>
  <text start="419.57" dur="4.68">entrap or ensnare the Trump team but we</text>
  <text start="423.199" dur="2.301">need to look at something very</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="7.26">interesting</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="8.32">Trump juniors meeting equals not a</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="3.87">felony it wasn&amp;#39;t really a felony someone</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="4.11">had information he wanted to hear the</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="4.8">information to see what they had and</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="3.84">that was it had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="3.959">government or anything like that it was</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="3.959">just a lawyer who wanted to reveal</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="4.951">something which again nothing was</text>
  <text start="445.729" dur="6.701">revealed Susan Rice unmasking well</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="4.87">actually that&amp;#39;s a felony so</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="4.26">we need to understand what is going on</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="6.57">here and if we look at Susan Rice right</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="7.29">now we need to understand that she has</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="7.47">become a multi-millionaire and a lot of</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="7.32">these government officials they become</text>
  <text start="468" dur="6.27">multi millionaires while they were in</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="5.37">government now she was on a salary of a</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="6.56">hundred and seventy two thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="476.67" dur="9.53">and after she finished her time in</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="7.39">government her net worth is 50 million</text>
  <text start="486.2" dur="4.6">now you know why none of these</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="4.71">individuals want to leave because they</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="3.99">make a lot of money they come in they</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="5.19">have no money whatsoever and they become</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="4.74">very very wealthy in government and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="3.42">sure the founding fathers they</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="5.07">definitely did not want this this way</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="5.49">and once again where are they making</text>
  <text start="504.6" dur="3.69">these these millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="4.71">dollars well</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="7.77">central bank corporate interests foreign</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="8.63">entities and this is why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="7.34">working for the people so here we are</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="5.5">we&amp;#39;ll see if she actually testifies or</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="5.55">maybe she&amp;#39;s going to plead the fifth if</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="5.61">she subpoenaed and maybe she&amp;#39;ll ask for</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="4.21">Congress to get a grand jury which will</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="3.42">take years and years and years and push</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="5.43">it out but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="6.48">all plays out now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="538.59" dur="6.06">that there was this huge drop-off in the</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="4.89">number of illegal border crossers these</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="3.27">are not immigrants that are coming in</text>
  <text start="546.27" dur="2.97">through the proper channels these are</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="3.15">people are trying to jump over the</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="4.47">border and coming to the United States</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="4.59">now remember under Obama as soon as they</text>
  <text start="553.71" dur="4.71">jumped over they were shipped off into</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="4.74">these sanctuary cities now the National</text>
  <text start="558.42" dur="4.86">Border Patrol Council President Brandon</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="6.51">Judd said this is unbelievable that</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="6.23">everything has dropped almost in half</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="5.04">fifty three percent decrease in</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="6.49">apprehensions at the southwest border</text>
  <text start="571.95" dur="5.25">compared to last year and the only</text>
  <text start="576" dur="3.9">reason this is happening is because</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="6.14">they&amp;#39;re enforcing the law that&amp;#39;s all you</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="5.82">had to do because if you would take each</text>
  <text start="583.34" dur="2.96">individual and you put them on a bus and</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="4.24">you send them all</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="5.07">to the sanctuary city of course no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="4.14">going to be sent back because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="5.97">sending them the opposite way if you</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="4.98">follow the law and anyone that crosses</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="3.51">illegally remember there&amp;#39;s a difference</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="4.56">between an immigrant and an illegal</text>
  <text start="600.85" dur="5.43">immigrant and in the legal border</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="5.1">crossing and you send them back guess</text>
  <text start="606.28" dur="4.11">what you cut down on the number of</text>
  <text start="608.74" dur="6.24">illegals and during the country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="8.22">that simple now Trump is pushing the war</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="5.34">on pedophiles and it looks like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="5.18">a lot of different pieces of legislation</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="6.03">that are being passed HR 2660 for</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="4.54">enhancing detection of human trafficking</text>
  <text start="626.35" dur="3.69">Act this is going to direct the</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="3.57">Secretary of Labor to train certain</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="3.57">Department of Labor personnel on how to</text>

  <text start="635.59" dur="5.22">trafficking during the course of their</text>
  <text start="637.3" dur="6.57">primary roles and responsibilities we</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="5.37">see other laws like HR 2480 empowering</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="5.43">law enforcement to fight sex trafficking</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="5.19">demand act now this is going to amend</text>
  <text start="649.3" dur="5.13">the Omnibus Crime Control and safe</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="5.73">streets Act of 1968 to include an</text>

  <text start="659.83" dur="4.47">program and other purposes and we can</text>
  <text start="662.71" dur="5.31">see there&amp;#39;s many different things going</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="5.76">on here like the HR 2250 code lists</text>
  <text start="668.02" dur="4.77">trafficking victims prevention and</text>

  <text start="686.35" dur="5.34">this war on foreign fronts and we can</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="4.26">see there&amp;#39;s many different pieces of</text>
  <text start="691.69" dur="5.58">legislation that are being passed right</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="6.99">now to stop these human trafficking and</text>
  <text start="697.27" dur="5.79">to and to crack down on these pedo rings</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="4.83">so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="703.06" dur="5.73">and what direction this actually goes</text>
  <text start="705.55" dur="5.64">now we see that the US Joint Chiefs of</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="4.98">Staff General Paul Selva he was</text>
  <text start="711.19" dur="5.16">testifying in front of Congress and it</text>
  <text start="713.77" dur="5.1">looks like he&amp;#39;s out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="3.75">North Korea has no ability to accurately</text>
  <text start="718.87" dur="3.39">strike the United States</text>
  <text start="720.1" dur="4.11">and what they&amp;#39;re really saying because</text>
  <text start="722.26" dur="4.23">we known this from Russia we known this</text>
  <text start="724.21" dur="4.44">from South Korea their Intelligence</text>
  <text start="726.49" dur="4.92">Agency that North Korea never filed</text>
  <text start="728.65" dur="4.5">fired a ballistic missile and now the</text>
  <text start="731.41" dur="3.15">United States is out there saying yeah</text>

  <text start="734.56" dur="4.5">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="737.11" dur="4.17">saying they really don&amp;#39;t have the means</text>
  <text start="739.06" dur="3.48">of actually directing the missile and</text>
  <text start="741.28" dur="3.57">hitting the United States what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="742.54" dur="5.16">really saying is this wasn&amp;#39;t a ballistic</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="5.25">missile the corporate media lied it was</text>
  <text start="747.7" dur="4.68">completely fake and now they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="750.1" dur="5.04">us that yeah they really don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="752.38" dur="5.97">technology as of yet now remember this</text>
  <text start="755.14" dur="5.07">was being pushed out there to try to to</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="4.02">try to get us into war this was the</text>
  <text start="760.21" dur="4.11">whole point they wanted Trump they</text>
  <text start="762.37" dur="4.95">wanted the Congress they wanted the</text>
  <text start="764.32" dur="4.95">people to do something and again nothing</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="4.08">was done we see out in Turkey</text>
  <text start="769.27" dur="5.22">well Turkey has agreed to a two point</text>
  <text start="771.4" dur="6.27">five billion dollar deal to acquire the</text>
  <text start="774.49" dur="5.82">s400 missile system and it looks like on</text>
  <text start="777.67" dur="4.49">Turkey now is moving closer and closer</text>
  <text start="780.31" dur="4.86">to Russia they&amp;#39;re using Russian</text>
  <text start="782.16" dur="6.55">technology and we need to remember the</text>
  <text start="785.17" dur="5.46">s400 it is capable of intercepting all</text>
  <text start="788.71" dur="4.17">types of modern air weaponry including</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="5.25">the fifth-generation warplanes as well</text>
  <text start="792.88" dur="6">as ballistic and cruise missiles at a</text>
  <text start="795.88" dur="7.56">maximum range of around 250 miles or so</text>
  <text start="798.88" dur="7.59">and remember Turkey was going to use the</text>
  <text start="803.44" dur="6.12">Patriot missile system it was deployed</text>
  <text start="806.47" dur="6.63">temporarily in Turkey and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="809.56" dur="5.04">switching over and using Russian missile</text>
  <text start="813.1" dur="5.01">systems and I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="814.6" dur="5.82">happen eventually is that Russia will be</text>
  <text start="818.11" dur="4.98">able to use most likely maybe the</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="4.68">Incirlik airbase in Turkey as they get</text>
  <text start="823.09" dur="4.53">closer and closer as the pipeline is</text>
  <text start="825.1" dur="4.62">completed and we can see there are deals</text>
  <text start="827.62" dur="4.62">being worked out between Turkey and</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="4.95">Russia and the United States deep state</text>
  <text start="832.24" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re being left out in the cold now</text>
  <text start="834.67" dur="4.68">we see out in Syria</text>
  <text start="836.62" dur="5.25">well the Islamic state and the moderate</text>
  <text start="839.35" dur="5.28">rebels the other terrorist groups like</text>
  <text start="841.87" dur="4.65">al Qaeda al sham they are now being</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="3.33">surrounded we understand that Iraq and</text>
  <text start="846.52" dur="4.95">Syria they&amp;#39;ve taken over the border in</text>
  <text start="847.96" dur="5.72">the south we understand that in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="851.47" dur="5.029">now the</text>
  <text start="853.68" dur="5.79">army they&amp;#39;re military they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="856.499" dur="6">be working with Syria to take control of</text>
  <text start="859.47" dur="4.409">their borders and there are some Islamic</text>
  <text start="862.499" dur="3.301">state terrorists that are in the</text>
  <text start="863.879" dur="4.531">mountainous areas they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="865.8" dur="4.949">going after those individuals but</text>
  <text start="868.41" dur="4.649">Lebanon and Syria they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="870.749" dur="4.741">controlling the borders their turkey</text>
  <text start="873.059" dur="5.28">controls the borders up north we see</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="5.189">that Iraq is controlling the border down</text>
  <text start="878.339" dur="6.48">south and then we have Israel and Jordan</text>
  <text start="880.679" dur="7.741">that area which borders Syria and we can</text>
  <text start="884.819" dur="4.89">see right now that the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="888.42" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to move</text>
  <text start="889.709" dur="6.261">back and forth they&amp;#39;re really done for</text>
  <text start="892.23" dur="6.389">at this point now we see that the</text>
  <text start="895.97" dur="5.77">moderate rebels well they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="898.619" dur="7.681">to abide by the ceasefire they denounced</text>
  <text start="901.74" dur="5.879">the US backed us russia-backed ceasefire</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re not going along</text>
  <text start="907.619" dur="7.41">with it and once again we know that a</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="6.299">ceasefire only works if all sides agreed</text>
  <text start="915.029" dur="4.62">to it but I think at this point the</text>
  <text start="918.029" dur="4.41">moderate rebels and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="919.649" dur="4.35">terrorist groups they are dwindling in</text>
  <text start="922.439" dur="3.361">numbers and I think at this point it</text>
  <text start="923.999" dur="4.14">really doesn&amp;#39;t matter and we can see</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="4.8">that the u.s. the deep state they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="928.139" dur="4.32">really concerned with these groups</text>
  <text start="930.6" dur="4.679">anymore because they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="932.459" dur="6.031">agenda with the Kurds where Russia right</text>
  <text start="935.279" dur="6.12">now is using Turkey to keep this from</text>
  <text start="938.49" dur="5.279">happening in Syria so we can see both</text>
  <text start="941.399" dur="5.13">sides are planning certain things and</text>
  <text start="943.769" dur="5.281">once again we can see the deep state</text>
  <text start="946.529" dur="6.15">well they are definitely losing ground</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="5.399">and they are I think they&amp;#39;re almost done</text>
  <text start="952.679" dur="4.171">for at this point now Russia was out</text>
  <text start="954.449" dur="5.73">there and Sergey Lavrov he was</text>
  <text start="956.85" dur="5.429">responding to Benjamin Netanyahu where</text>
  <text start="960.179" dur="4.051">Israel is feeling that they&amp;#39;re left out</text>
  <text start="962.279" dur="6.81">of this ceasefire they don&amp;#39;t agree to it</text>
  <text start="964.23" dur="6.69">and Lavrov is saying listen the US and</text>
  <text start="969.089" dur="3.331">Russia both agree that Israel has no</text>
  <text start="970.92" dur="3.599">real argument to make against the</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="5.159">ceasefire and accompanying the</text>
  <text start="974.519" dur="4.8">de-escalation zone that is why it would</text>
  <text start="977.579" dur="3.48">be more reasonable for Tel Aviv not to</text>
  <text start="979.319" dur="3.841">come down on the already reached</text>
  <text start="981.059" dur="6.32">agreement between Russia and the US but</text>
  <text start="983.16" dur="6.289">instead find ways how to live with it</text>
  <text start="987.379" dur="4.26">rhe benefits from victory over the</text>
  <text start="989.449" dur="5.91">Islamic state which benefit all</text>
  <text start="991.639" dur="6.39">countries of the region and really what</text>
  <text start="995.359" dur="4.2">Lavrov is saying is tough this is</text>
  <text start="998.029" dur="3.93">happening there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do</text>
  <text start="999.559" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;re not a part of this we see the</text>
  <text start="1001.959" dur="5.19">deconfliction channel that has been</text>
  <text start="1005.019" dur="5.19">opened once again between Russia and the</text>
  <text start="1007.149" dur="5.13">US and they&amp;#39;re talking to each other to</text>
  <text start="1010.209" dur="4.59">make sure that you know they don&amp;#39;t hit</text>
  <text start="1012.279" dur="4.68">each other&amp;#39;s planes or hit the troops so</text>
  <text start="1014.799" dur="4.74">it looks like communication is back up</text>
  <text start="1016.959" dur="5.88">and running and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1019.539" dur="4.65">that the entire mission and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1022.839" dur="3.96">talking about the deep state I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1024.189" dur="5.01">talking to the rogue part of the</text>
  <text start="1026.799" dur="4.41">Pentagon the deep state that&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1029.199" dur="4.651">still reach their goal I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1031.209" dur="5.1">the US and the other parts where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1033.85" dur="4.949">working with Russia right now to make</text>
  <text start="1036.309" dur="4.86">sure that there are no problems in Syria</text>
  <text start="1038.799" dur="5.34">and if you look you can see all of a</text>
  <text start="1041.169" dur="5.79">sudden all these countries the US</text>
  <text start="1044.139" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re able to go after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1046.959" dur="4.59">state they&amp;#39;re able to defeat the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1048.639" dur="5.821">state and it&amp;#39;s really not that difficult</text>
  <text start="1051.549" dur="4.561">it was never difficult the only reason</text>
  <text start="1054.46" dur="4.469">it was difficult it was because Obama</text>
  <text start="1056.11" dur="4.89">was directing the military of where to</text>
  <text start="1058.929" dur="4.62">strike they were never hitting the</text>
  <text start="1061" dur="4.679">Islamic state they were making it easier</text>
  <text start="1063.549" dur="4.5">for the Islamic state to move forward</text>
  <text start="1065.679" dur="4.801">and to progress towards Damascus to get</text>
  <text start="1068.049" dur="4.83">rid of Assad and we see right now if you</text>
  <text start="1070.48" dur="4.949">actually go after the terrorists you can</text>
  <text start="1072.879" dur="6.18">defeat them and Russia has proved this</text>
  <text start="1075.429" dur="5.46">because as we&amp;#39;ve seen Russia went after</text>
  <text start="1079.059" dur="5.58">the terrorist groups and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1080.889" dur="7.53">their numbers started to drop their oil</text>
  <text start="1084.639" dur="6.41">convoys started to disappear and we see</text>
  <text start="1088.419" dur="6.571">that everything started to reverse</text>
  <text start="1091.049" dur="5.921">itself and once again we can see that</text>
  <text start="1094.99" dur="4.08">the u.s. the deep state</text>
  <text start="1096.97" dur="6.24">they were never doing what they were</text>
  <text start="1099.07" dur="6.17">telling the American people now does</text>
  <text start="1103.21" dur="5.599">that mean the deep state is done no</text>
  <text start="1105.24" dur="6.819">because we&amp;#39;re getting word from GCHQ and</text>
  <text start="1108.809" dur="7.301">they are saying that hackers have likely</text>
  <text start="1112.059" dur="6.6">compromised UK energy sector targets and</text>
  <text start="1116.11" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re saying yes we have information</text>
  <text start="1118.659" dur="5.021">that the N</text>
  <text start="1120.65" dur="5.88">sector is compromised now the warning</text>
  <text start="1123.68" dur="5.34">comes at the same time as an anonymously</text>
  <text start="1126.53" dur="4.32">sourced report the time stating that the</text>
  <text start="1129.02" dur="5.19">suspected Russian military hackers and</text>

  <text start="1139.04" dur="5.19">of hackers targeting nuclear and energy</text>

  <text start="1146.87" dur="3.72">warning about this</text>
  <text start="1147.86" dur="5.73">GCHQ is warning about this and this</text>
  <text start="1150.59" dur="4.2">tells me that all of these warnings</text>
  <text start="1153.59" dur="4.56">especially coming out of the corporate</text>
  <text start="1154.79" dur="6.65">media they&amp;#39;re trying to Telegraph what</text>
  <text start="1158.15" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re going to do and I&amp;#39;ll go back to</text>
  <text start="1161.44" dur="6.55">2003 where we had that power outage on</text>
  <text start="1164.63" dur="5.58">the East Coast I believe that was a test</text>
  <text start="1167.99" dur="4.95">to see if they&amp;#39;re able to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1170.21" dur="4.41">system and how easy it would be to bring</text>
  <text start="1172.94" dur="4.08">it down then bring it up and make it</text>
  <text start="1174.62" dur="4.89">look like some type of an attack some</text>
  <text start="1177.02" dur="5.01">type of cyber attack and once again if</text>
  <text start="1179.51" dur="4.38">they do do something like they resort to</text>
  <text start="1182.03" dur="4.74">something like this because they have</text>

  <text start="1188.3" dur="4.28">with their claws you know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1190.13" dur="4.53">going to use some type of an event and</text>
  <text start="1192.58" dur="3.73">we can see there&amp;#39;s more and more of</text>
