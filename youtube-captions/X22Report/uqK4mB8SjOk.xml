  <text start="272.52" dur="7.17">long time ago they had everything</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="7.471">planned because they knew as they always</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="6.24">do that their system will only last a</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="5.01">certain period of time and it would have</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="4.22">to be restarted now you just can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="4.47">out and tell the people listen</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="4.42">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been doing the</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="2.699">debt that we&amp;#39;ve been placing on all</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="3.779">these nation</text>

  <text start="304.919" dur="3.24">going to work</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="4.71">this was just to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="308.159" dur="5.97">but eventually our system was going to</text>
  <text start="310.619" dur="5.97">crash crash and burn because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="314.129" dur="5.13">way our systems is designed they were</text>
  <text start="316.589" dur="4.14">never gonna come out and say that they</text>
  <text start="319.259" dur="5.64">like to use a cover-up</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="6.03">they like to blame others and this is</text>
  <text start="324.899" dur="4.95">why they&amp;#39;ve been trying to use Trump now</text>
  <text start="326.759" dur="6.18">in the beginning when Trump first came</text>
  <text start="329.849" dur="5.18">into office they thought they were still</text>
  <text start="332.939" dur="4.801">in control and at that point they were</text>
  <text start="335.029" dur="4.961">they thought all right Trump is in</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="4.889">office he&amp;#39;s going to push his economic</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="4.739">policies and we&amp;#39;re not gonna have to</text>
  <text start="342.629" dur="4.74">worry about Europe Asia and the rest of</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="8.4">the world because all we have to do is</text>
  <text start="347.369" dur="9.54">raise the interest rates in 2018 2019 a</text>
  <text start="353.129" dur="6.93">lot more hit that tipping point and the</text>
  <text start="356.909" dur="6.06">entire economic system would come</text>
  <text start="360.059" dur="6.63">tumbling down and all we have to do is</text>
  <text start="362.969" dur="5.94">point the finger at Trump he was trying</text>
  <text start="366.689" dur="4.62">to push his economic policies they</text>
  <text start="368.909" dur="4.5">failed he got rid of the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="371.309" dur="3.48">deals he got rid of everything the</text>
  <text start="373.409" dur="4.76">central bank the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="6.41">doing for many years and because of this</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="7.48">the entire global economic system</text>
  <text start="381.199" dur="6.491">collapsed what did Trump do what acute</text>
  <text start="385.649" dur="6.151">tell us</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="7.29">about the Fed cute told us that they</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="5.97">knew of this plan q said this was going</text>
  <text start="394.98" dur="7.77">to be reversed you told us this in 2018</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="8.64">and in 2019 it was reversed now Trump is</text>
  <text start="402.75" dur="5.64">pushing the Fed to lower rates now since</text>
  <text start="406.41" dur="5.13">they didn&amp;#39;t have that story they had to</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="6.93">move on to the trade deals the trade the</text>
  <text start="411.54" dur="7.2">tariffs the trade wars and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="6.72">they are right now they&amp;#39;re trying to use</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="5.81">the trade wars to explain away why all</text>
  <text start="422.04" dur="6.45">of this is happening why Europe is</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="7.33">falling apart now if you go back to 1929</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="6.6">previous to 1929 Europe was falling</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="5.85">apart then too and then it finally hit</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="5.51">the United States this is what it looks</text>
  <text start="437.73" dur="6.6">like when a central bank system</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="7.3">completely falls apart when it breaks</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="6.12">down we&amp;#39;re at the end stage right now</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="5.79">Trump knows this the Patriots know this</text>
