  <text start="132.09" dur="5.179">looks like they&amp;#39;re out of the woods well</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="4.87">nothing to be further from the truth and</text>
  <text start="137.269" dur="5.86">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="6.99">complete breakdown of the Greek system</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="5.731">and it looks like they cannot make this</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="4.08">deal happen where they can take on a lot</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="5.07">more debt which is something they really</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t need but we see Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="4.589">from the IMF which is the International</text>

  <text start="164.84" dur="5.319">urging europe to offer the country</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="8.25">substantial debt relief because the</text>
  <text start="170.159" dur="9.241">central bankers realize if a country has</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="5.6">too much debt they go under they</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="3.17">collapse</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="3.84">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen because</text>
  <text start="182.57" dur="3.75">the rest of the countries will look at</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="3.69">this and say look what the central</text>
  <text start="186.32" dur="4.5">bankers just did they just collapsed a</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="4.89">country they told us they were improving</text>
  <text start="190.82" dur="6.09">but as they kept on putting on more and</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="6.98">more debt look what just happened they</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="6.9">can&amp;#39;t let this happen their entire</text>
  <text start="200.26" dur="7.57">system works on keeping countries in</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="7.14">limbo enough debt to make everyone</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="7.47">believe they are helping at the same</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="6.45">time they&amp;#39;re stealing their assets this</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="5.33">is how central banks work this is why</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="5.79">they want not a full debt relief a</text>
  <text start="220.63" dur="5.53">partial just to give Greece some</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="7.2">breathing room will it help absolutely</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="8.07">not now yanis varoufakis is out there</text>
  <text start="230.39" dur="7.49">and he&amp;#39;s saying that austerity is a</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="8.13">cover story for conducting class warfare</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="9.52">against the poor which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="6.33">true austerity does not help it helps</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="4.2">the central bankers it helps the</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="7.1">creditors it helps keep the country in</text>
  <text start="251.6" dur="6.629">that limbo state but that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="5.64">eventually what happens as you keep</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.401">implementing austerity people get poor</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="4.72">people find it very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="4.98">work and it gets worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="5.91">goes on and we are definitely seeing</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="5.79">this in Greece because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="6.18">right now is rioting in Greece once</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="6.84">again we see police gone up against</text>
  <text start="278.24" dur="5.64">farmers protesting tax and pension</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="4.53">reforms in Athens there were about a</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="4.59">thousand people trying to force the way</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="4.62">into the agriculture ministry and the</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="3.21">police were you know hitting them with</text>
  <text start="290.39" dur="4.92">tear gas that people are throwing</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="7.35">bottles cans breaking windows because</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="7.5">they are very upset things are breaking</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="6.72">down and what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="6.539">is that the people of Greece well things</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.49">have not improved at all I mean if you</text>
  <text start="309.349" dur="3.281">listen to the people one of the</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="6.88">individuals said to stay</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="9.72">is taking 75% of my income he said we</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="8.88">all need meds to endure this one I mean</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="8.61">that is quite a bit and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327" dur="6.26">seeing right now is that coming from the</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.98">country Statistical Service else that</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="5.38">that after two straight quarters of</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="5.76">growth Greece&amp;#39;s economy contracted from</text>
  <text start="338.64" dur="4.86">october to December marking the worst</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="3.66">quarterly performance since the height</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="5.07">of the country&amp;#39;s debt crisis in the</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="5.4">summer of 2015 what they did was they</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="4.41">play with numbers they made it look like</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="6.42">the country was improving but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="5.52">impossible yes you can shift numbers</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="3.51">here and there make it look like</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="3.48">unemployment coming down manipulate the</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="4.37">unemployment we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the United</text>
  <text start="361.98" dur="7.08">States but in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="5.59">eventually it all comes around and the</text>
  <text start="369.06" dur="3.66">whole thing falls apart and this is what</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now marine lepen is</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="4.8">out there saying that if she wins the</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="4.32">elections first they&amp;#39;re going to remove</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="4.53">themselves from the EU just like all the</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="5.61">other countries and she&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="6.18">introduce the new Frank at a rate of one</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="4.62">to one to the euro well the central</text>
  <text start="388.23" dur="3.51">bankers are not going to like this I</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="6.27">mean the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="8.16">they dislike her now well if she wins</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="5.75">and makes that move well the next move</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="5.4">for the central bank in the deep state</text>
  <text start="401.66" dur="6.31">will probably target her removal and you</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="6.75">know what i mean by that we see Mexico</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="6.54">right now they have taken a trade war</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="5.22">shot at the United States I guess they</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t like what Trump was saying and it</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.97">looks like they&amp;#39;re pushing an agenda it</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="6.12">appears that Mexico right now has taken</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.29">a pre-emptive step in the imminent trade</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="5.1">dispute by cancelling existing sugar</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="4.95">export permits to the u.s. in a dispute</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="3.93">over the pace of shipments and this</text>
  <text start="432.48" dur="3.87">trade flare up which is the beginning of</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.29">trade wars which actually then leads</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="7.59">into war well this most likely is going</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="7.829">to disrupt supplies and we could see</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="6.479">maybe shortage issue</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="5.49">footage of sugar we see that ATP came</text>
  <text start="450.419" dur="3.3">out with their numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.129" dur="3.81">coming out saying that jobs have just</text>
  <text start="453.719" dur="5.461">surged since the election things look</text>
  <text start="455.939" dur="6.961">fantastic and once again they are</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="5.759">lockstep with the BLS they pretty much</text>
  <text start="462.9" dur="4.56">are very close to whatever the BLS says</text>
  <text start="464.939" dur="3.991">and we know that the BLS well they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="3.359">count those individuals that have fallen</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="3.69">off and at this point we can see that</text>
  <text start="470.819" dur="3.75">adp most likely their numbers are</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="5.22">manipulated just like the BLS because</text>
  <text start="474.569" dur="7.141">they&amp;#39;re very very close and similar when</text>
  <text start="477.84" dur="6.99">you look at the graphs over time now</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="6.479">caterpillar remember we had the FDIC the</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="7.109">IRS investigating caterpillar well it</text>
  <text start="488.189" dur="6.75">looks like the mystery is solved the</text>
  <text start="491.939" dur="6.891">raid on the office by US government</text>
  <text start="494.939" dur="9.5">agencies well it looks like it involved</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="10.089">tax and accounting manipulation or</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="6.85">accounting fraud now this is coming from</text>
  <text start="508.919" dur="6.81">the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="5.88">and Leslie a Robinson an accountant</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="5.79">professor at the Tuck School of Business</text>
  <text start="517.169" dur="6.571">and the author of this report that came</text>
  <text start="521.519" dur="4.411">out said i believe the company&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="4.289">non-compliance with these rules was</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="3.33">deliberate and primarily with the</text>
  <text start="528.029" dur="3.3">intention of maintaining the higher</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="5.009">share price these actions were</text>
  <text start="531.329" dur="5.611">fraudulent rather than negligent and she</text>
  <text start="534.269" dur="7.32">was looking at caterpillar and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="6.36">saying that for example a correspondence</text>
  <text start="541.589" dur="3.24">between the company and the Securities</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="3.86">Exchange Commission in which caterpillar</text>
  <text start="544.829" dur="4.2">said it had 2.5 billion of income</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="6.34">eligible to be brought into the night</text>
  <text start="549.029" dur="5.971">state&amp;#39;s tax free ms robinson wrote that</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="3.87">her research showed that the company did</text>
  <text start="555" dur="4.91">not have anywhere near the sum still</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="5.85">available to be brought in tax-free and</text>
  <text start="559.91" dur="5.23">this is one example that she is citing</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="4.71">now remember caterpillar they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="565.14" dur="4.98">trouble sales have been declining for 25</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="5.399">months factories are closing the laying</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="6.959">off people and the global market well</text>
  <text start="573.329" dur="5.551">it&amp;#39;s a disaster right now so they might</text>
  <text start="577.079" dur="3.331">have been doing some tricky accounting</text>
  <text start="578.88" dur="5.189">to make their</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="7.88">entire company look a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="584.069" dur="7.44">was to keep stock prices up we see that</text>
  <text start="588.29" dur="5.169">us productivity growth slowed</text>
  <text start="591.509" dur="3.181">dramatically in the fourth quarter now</text>
  <text start="593.459" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re starting to see things start to</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="5.639">come down after the election in November</text>
  <text start="597.089" dur="5.461">and it looks like we had that dead cat</text>
  <text start="600.329" dur="4.411">bounce and now everything&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="4.56">normalize because q4 was a</text>
  <text start="604.74" dur="4.88">disappointment as growth slowed to about</text>
  <text start="607.11" dur="5.25">one point three percent below the 1.5%</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="5.23">expectation and it looks like it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="5.159">back to where it was one President Obama</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="5.76">was in office and most likely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="5.521">going to see a drop even further and now</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="5.039">we see coming out of the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="4.289">where we reported on the GDP being</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="3.75">estimated at one point three percent the</text>
  <text start="627.329" dur="4.351">Atlanta Fed well it just flashed it</text>
  <text start="629.399" dur="3.391">again it is now down to one point two</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="3.54">percent what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="4.469">all of this is the down the sp500 keep</text>
  <text start="635.22" dur="5.13">moving up and up and up and the GDP is</text>
  <text start="637.259" dur="5.43">going the opposite direction now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="5.7">been seeing and hearing a lot of</text>

  <text start="664.41" dur="5.97">suddenly changed in the market in recent</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="6.239">days and when they look at their macro</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="4.98">model well it shows that something is</text>
  <text start="672.959" dur="5.13">going on here and what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="675.36" dur="5.31">that the good folks at kew on our quant</text>

  <text start="705.559" dur="6.22">that mean that the SPS are going through</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="5.04">a regime change and typically when the</text>

  <text start="725.93" dur="7.15">1937 all over again because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.41" dur="5">seeing right now is that GDP has now</text>
  <text start="733.08" dur="6.03">collapsed from three-point-four percent</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="5.55">early februari to 1.2 % and this is the</text>
  <text start="739.11" dur="4.77">estimate that the Atlanta Fed was given</text>
  <text start="740.96" dur="7.21">it will be revised even lower based on</text>
  <text start="743.88" dur="6.75">the awful deficit numbers inflation is</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="5.19">soaring the Fed tracks for inflation</text>
  <text start="750.63" dur="5.91">metrics they are core CPI core pce</text>
  <text start="753.36" dur="7.35">trimmed mean CPI and the Cleveland</text>
  <text start="756.54" dur="7.32">median CPI and roughly all four are now</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="5.34">at or above the Fed so-called target of</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="3.87">2% we see inflation moving up we saw</text>
  <text start="766.05" dur="5.01">also seen in Germany and Spain and other</text>
  <text start="767.73" dur="6.24">countries now weak economic growth and</text>
  <text start="771.06" dur="5.7">soaring inflation there&amp;#39;s a word for</text>
  <text start="773.97" dur="5.79">that it&amp;#39;s called stagflation now the Fed</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="7.56">is going to do and repeat what they did</text>
  <text start="779.76" dur="9.63">in 1937 they&amp;#39;re going to hike rates into</text>
  <text start="784.32" dur="10.37">a weak economy now like then the CPI is</text>
  <text start="789.39" dur="10.83">soaring while GP GDP growth is flatlined</text>
  <text start="794.69" dur="9.49">now what was the outcome in 1937 well</text>
  <text start="800.22" dur="7.25">the entire system plunged into another</text>
  <text start="804.18" dur="7.71">recession actually a depression and</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="8.32">stocks nearly halved at that point it</text>
  <text start="811.89" dur="9.66">was a complete disaster and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="815.79" dur="9.48">the same thing once again now could more</text>
  <text start="821.55" dur="7.29">is out there and he is saying that the</text>
  <text start="825.27" dur="6.66">correction well it&amp;#39;s already started the</text>
  <text start="828.84" dur="5.79">VIX emerging markets copper hard macro</text>
  <text start="831.93" dur="6.3">data and now high-yield credit are all</text>
  <text start="834.63" dur="6.18">breaking down at the same time now this</text>
  <text start="838.23" dur="3.66">is just another indicator to be added to</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="3.27">everything now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="841.89" dur="5.31">about all this we just talked about the</text>
  <text start="844.08" dur="3.9">Fed hiking the interest rate into an</text>
  <text start="847.2" dur="3.48">economy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.98" dur="6.39">failing which repeats what happened back</text>
  <text start="850.68" dur="5.46">in 1937 and the fed well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.37" dur="6.21">supposed to be a neutral independent</text>
  <text start="856.14" dur="9.78">entity however that meant that myth went</text>
  <text start="860.58" dur="7.11">out the window now Yellen seems to be</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="3.33">even more committed to defining the Fed</text>
  <text start="867.69" dur="4.5">as nothing more than a leftist</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="5.58">establishment mechanism because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.19" dur="5.07">look back in October when it looked like</text>
  <text start="874.83" dur="5.37">Hillary Clinton would win the 2016</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="5.19">presidential election Yellen commented</text>
  <text start="880.2" dur="5.07">that she was considering letting the</text>
  <text start="882.45" dur="4.59">economy run hot meaning allowing</text>
  <text start="885.27" dur="5.61">inflation to rise without implementing</text>
  <text start="887.04" dur="7.62">additional rate hikes now Trump won the</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="6.09">election and yellin announced she wanted</text>
  <text start="894.66" dur="5.34">to hike rates in December with three</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="5.85">more additional hikes in 2017 completely</text>
  <text start="900" dur="4.98">opposite of what she said when Hillary</text>
  <text start="902.82" dur="4.23">looked like she was going to win now the</text>
  <text start="904.98" dur="4.2">third quarter of 2015 growth was</text>
  <text start="907.05" dur="4.41">supposedly three-point-five percent if</text>
  <text start="909.18" dur="3.96">that had been true then yes the Fed</text>
  <text start="911.46" dur="4.67">should have considered hiking however</text>
  <text start="913.14" dur="6.27">since that time GDP growth has collapsed</text>
  <text start="916.13" dur="5.47">fourth-quarter 16 growth came in at one</text>
  <text start="919.41" dur="5.01">point nine percent the first quarter of</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="4.2">2017 it&amp;#39;s looking like it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="3.93">a 1.2 percent they thought it was going</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="7.95">to be three percent but it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="928.35" dur="9.72">close and Yellen is still pushing a rate</text>
  <text start="933.75" dur="6.75">hike so back in October when the economy</text>
  <text start="938.07" dur="4.32">was supposedly growing at an annual a</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="5.67">annualized rate of three point five</text>
  <text start="942.39" dur="6.78">percent Yellen wanted to let the economy</text>
  <text start="946.17" dur="5.28">run hot and now the economy is growing</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="3.54">at a two percent rate and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="951.45" dur="3.27">forecasted that it&amp;#39;s going to be going</text>
  <text start="952.71" dur="4.05">down to one point two percent and when</text>
  <text start="954.72" dur="6.45">you look at everything and what she is</text>
  <text start="956.76" dur="6.06">doing and how it compares to 1937 it</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="5.28">looks like she&amp;#39;s getting ready to</text>
  <text start="962.82" dur="6.66">trigger the economic collapse she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="4.41">actually doing it now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="2.88">not going to tell you this is what</text>
  <text start="970.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="972.36" dur="6.15">as soon as she does it but as we</text>
  <text start="976.11" dur="5.13">move throughout the year this is the</text>
  <text start="978.51" dur="4.98">trigger they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring down</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="4.71">the economy now Russia and China they</text>
  <text start="983.49" dur="5.07">understand that the dollar dominance</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="5.04">well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end they realize</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="5.339">this and a london-based bullion broker</text>
  <text start="990.99" dur="5.339">sharps Pixley formerly owned by deutsche</text>
  <text start="993.899" dur="4.68">bank has suggested that russia&amp;#39;s gold</text>

  <text start="998.579" dur="6.361">end of this year and what we look when</text>
  <text start="1002.54" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re looking at all of this we can see</text>
  <text start="1004.94" dur="4.98">that russia and china well they see gold</text>
  <text start="1008" dur="6.149">as an important element in the global</text>
  <text start="1009.92" dur="6.69">financial system china has reportedly</text>

  <text start="1018.589" dur="5.61">IMF&amp;#39;s SDRs now some will argue that gold</text>
  <text start="1022.55" dur="3.96">in effect should be treated as the</text>
  <text start="1024.199" dur="4.291">currency others will disagree certainly</text>
  <text start="1026.51" dur="4.439">russia&amp;#39;s President Putin is a goal</text>
  <text start="1028.49" dur="5.4">believer he continually accumulates gold</text>
  <text start="1030.949" dur="5.73">the Chinese hierarchy is perhaps a</text>
  <text start="1033.89" dur="5.1">little more circumspect in its open</text>
  <text start="1036.679" dur="4.321">support for gold but both nations are</text>
  <text start="1038.99" dur="6.709">keen to see the US dollar dominance of</text>

  <text start="1049.25" dur="6.15">seeing right now is that they are</text>
  <text start="1052.07" dur="6.21">preparing for this they are using gold</text>
  <text start="1055.4" dur="7.17">or they will be using gold to chip away</text>
  <text start="1058.28" dur="6.72">at the US dollar dominance it is now</text>
  <text start="1062.57" dur="6.18">being discussed openly even in London</text>
