  <text start="26.77" dur="5.32">hi and welcome to the x-22 report my</text>
  <text start="29.84" dur="5.399">name is Dave and this is episode 481 and</text>
  <text start="32.09" dur="5.94">today&amp;#39;s date is October 1st 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.239" dur="5.131">title of this episode is Ebola in u.s.</text>
  <text start="38.03" dur="4.399">will it be used to declare martial law</text>
  <text start="40.37" dur="4.469">now we understand that Ebola now is</text>
  <text start="42.429" dur="4.241">basically in West Africa it&amp;#39;s in those</text>
  <text start="44.839" dur="3.781">nations where there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="46.67" dur="5.79">natural resources which were recently</text>
  <text start="48.62" dur="5.939">discovered and Ebola hasn&amp;#39;t really gone</text>
  <text start="52.46" dur="5.129">over the border to any other country</text>
  <text start="54.559" dur="5.52">inside of Africa which is very strange</text>
  <text start="57.589" dur="5.191">in itself but we do have a man who</text>
  <text start="60.079" dur="5.22">traveled from Liberia and he was</text>
  <text start="62.78" dur="3.9">infected and it is now confirmed and it</text>
  <text start="65.299" dur="4.351">seems like there&amp;#39;s a second patient</text>
  <text start="66.68" dur="5.94">which they&amp;#39;re trying to see if that</text>
  <text start="69.65" dur="6.24">person has Ebola now of course as we</text>
  <text start="72.62" dur="6.33">know Ebola from all the evidence shows</text>
  <text start="75.89" dur="4.8">that Ebola was created by the United</text>
  <text start="78.95" dur="3.87">States government certain different</text>
  <text start="80.69" dur="3.75">agencies Department of Defense and we</text>
  <text start="82.82" dur="5.51">can see that they&amp;#39;ve been using it in</text>
  <text start="84.44" dur="7.11">West Africa to decimate the economies in</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="4.93">there so they can bring troops in put</text>
  <text start="91.55" dur="3.96">all of these countries on the hook with</text>
  <text start="93.26" dur="3.93">the central bankers and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="95.51" dur="4.44">what they&amp;#39;re doing there at this point</text>
  <text start="97.19" dur="5.34">in time now the other agendas for Ebola</text>
  <text start="99.95" dur="4.59">could be martial law here in the United</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="4.5">States because as we know the government</text>
  <text start="104.54" dur="5.69">officials this has been part of their</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="5.76">agenda all along to suspend the</text>
  <text start="110.23" dur="5.62">Constitution to declare martial law to</text>
  <text start="112.79" dur="4.41">make sure they lock down the people and</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="3.51">control the people and this of course</text>
  <text start="117.2" dur="6.02">this is why they have DHS is why they</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="3.86">infiltrated all the local police</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="5.379">stations and and different areas and we</text>
  <text start="127.07" dur="3.9">can see right now that this could be</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="4.17">part of their agenda where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="4.919">building up the fear factor at this</text>
  <text start="133.069" dur="4.89">point making everyone believe that yes</text>
  <text start="135.889" dur="4.08">Ebola is now in the United States and</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="2.481">it&amp;#39;s going to spread now does it really</text>
  <text start="139.969" dur="3.711">have</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="6.12">to spread know they can use the fear to</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="4.74">say you know what to contain this we</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="3.57">need to declare martial law and they can</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="3.87">definitely do this and we can see it</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="6">actually happening now of course as we</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="6.48">know there are certain CDC locations all</text>
  <text start="156.13" dur="4.74">around the country they just so happen</text>
  <text start="158.77" dur="4.44">to correlate with where they&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="3.78">the illegals at this time but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.21" dur="3.87">all around the country they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="6.63">getting funeral homes and other places</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="7.5">prepped for an Ebola breakout they also</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="5.94">as we know ordered about 160 hazmat</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="5.25">suits and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="177.22" dur="5.46">is being prepped this really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="5.19">have to go live it could really be</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="3.9">pushed by using fear and you&amp;#39;re showing</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="4.29">that there are many different cases</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="3.9">going on that are contracting Ebola and</text>
  <text start="189.31" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit more</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="3.57">about this as we go through this report</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="5.67">but let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>

  <text start="226.72" dur="8.15">year and believe and below both August</text>

  <text start="935.04" dur="5.14">Minister resigned right now and we can</text>
  <text start="938.74" dur="2.61">see right now the only way this person</text>
  <text start="940.18" dur="2.61">got through is because they were let</text>
  <text start="941.35" dur="2.07">through and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="2.79">this</text>
  <text start="943.42" dur="3.66">is they want to build fortification</text>

  <text start="1004.08" dur="7.32">at all tell on everybody and we will</text>
  <text start="1008.01" dur="6.69">investigate and you can see exactly what</text>
  <text start="1011.4" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re doing they want people in the</text>
  <text start="1014.7" dur="5.34">neighborhoods to tell on their neighbors</text>
  <text start="1016.71" dur="4.92">we already have it in New York a if you</text>

  <text start="1032.88" dur="3.93">away their weapons this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1034.65" dur="5.58">what&amp;#39;s going on in New York they had the</text>
  <text start="1036.81" dur="5.7">pretty much stop and frisk policy but of</text>
  <text start="1040.23" dur="5.04">course that was unconstitutional Detroit</text>
  <text start="1042.51" dur="5.22">has the stop and frisk policy where they</text>
  <text start="1045.27" dur="4.65">completely violate your rights and we</text>
  <text start="1047.73" dur="5.58">can see that this is starting to build</text>
  <text start="1049.92" dur="6.09">up and they want everyone to turn on</text>
  <text start="1053.31" dur="5.97">each other this is their plan to get</text>
  <text start="1056.01" dur="6">everyone to basically be a snitch on</text>
  <text start="1059.28" dur="5.91">each other and it makes their job a lot</text>
  <text start="1062.01" dur="5.85">easier when this occurs so it looks like</text>

  <text start="1176.34" dur="3.9">total is much higher and I think a lot</text>

  <text start="1234.55" dur="7.53">confirmed Sierra Leone 1816 confirmed</text>
  <text start="1239.02" dur="4.92">and we can see right now that it is only</text>
  <text start="1242.08" dur="4.89">in these countries and it has not</text>
  <text start="1243.94" dur="4.23">migrated to any of the any of the other</text>
  <text start="1246.97" dur="3.78">countries that they&amp;#39;re bordering</text>
  <text start="1248.17" dur="6.12">whatsoever but we had a man fly from</text>
  <text start="1250.75" dur="7.29">Liberia come to the US that is infected</text>
  <text start="1254.29" dur="5.49">very interesting now I know the CDC is</text>
  <text start="1258.04" dur="3.78">out there saying that this is not</text>
  <text start="1259.78" dur="4.92">airborne right now and they removed it</text>
  <text start="1261.82" dur="7.17">from their site that it was airborne but</text>
  <text start="1264.7" dur="6.93">in a laboratory they&amp;#39;ve done a test</text>
  <text start="1268.99" dur="5.01">between primates where infection through</text>
  <text start="1271.63" dur="4.5">small particle aerosols has been</text>
  <text start="1274" dur="5.67">demonstrated in primates where they</text>
  <text start="1276.13" dur="5.94">could catch Ebola from one to the other</text>
  <text start="1279.67" dur="3.54">without touch it was through the air now</text>
  <text start="1282.07" dur="4.23">they of course they haven&amp;#39;t done this</text>
  <text start="1283.21" dur="5.34">test on humans but if it happens through</text>
  <text start="1286.3" dur="6.24">primates you can pretty much assume that</text>
  <text start="1288.55" dur="7.05">it probably does happen here through</text>
  <text start="1292.54" dur="6.15">human and through the air and we can see</text>
  <text start="1295.6" dur="5.31">right now that the CDC right now is kind</text>
  <text start="1298.69" dur="4.59">of hiding this they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="1300.91" dur="4.68">coming out right now they&amp;#39;re just saying</text>
  <text start="1303.28" dur="4.23">no it&amp;#39;s only through touch but they did</text>
  <text start="1305.59" dur="5.19">have it at one point on their website</text>
  <text start="1307.51" dur="5.4">and they kinda removed it completely now</text>
  <text start="1310.78" dur="5.82">right now we as we know funeral homes</text>
  <text start="1312.91" dur="6.12">are are being giving instructions on how</text>
  <text start="1316.6" dur="4.65">to deal with Ebola cases we understand</text>
  <text start="1319.03" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s a lot of hazmat suits that were</text>
  <text start="1321.25" dur="4.8">ordered just in case we understand</text>
  <text start="1324.01" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve already set up the CDC locations</text>
  <text start="1326.05" dur="4.29">around the country and we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="1328.33" dur="3.51">to watch this very very carefully</text>
  <text start="1330.34" dur="4.26">because if this thing starts to spread</text>
  <text start="1331.84" dur="3.9">very quickly and these people are in</text>
  <text start="1334.6" dur="3.33">quarantine and they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="1335.74" dur="4.95">touching people we will have proof that</text>
  <text start="1337.93" dur="5.25">yes it is airborne and this is part of</text>
  <text start="1340.69" dur="8.43">their agenda and as we know they want to</text>
  <text start="1343.18" dur="7.5">a shrink the population around the world</text>
  <text start="1349.12" dur="3.78">because this is part of their gender</text>
  <text start="1350.68" dur="3.96">shrink the population take away the</text>
  <text start="1352.9" dur="4.26">rights of the people control the people</text>
  <text start="1354.64" dur="4.47">get them into war to shrink it even</text>
  <text start="1357.16" dur="3.18">further and then have a one-world</text>
  <text start="1359.11" dur="4.71">government I mean this is pretty much</text>
  <text start="1360.34" dur="5.34">their whole agenda at this point and we</text>
  <text start="1363.82" dur="4.92">can see right now none of it is really</text>
  <text start="1365.68" dur="4.5">going their way but again they do not</text>
  <text start="1368.74" dur="3.87">want to be blamed for this entire</text>
  <text start="1370.18" dur="5.31">collapse of the entire system so they</text>
  <text start="1372.61" dur="4.83">need other angles to make everyone look</text>
  <text start="1375.49" dur="3.93">at in a different direction and we see</text>
  <text start="1377.44" dur="4.59">this happening with the war being</text>
  <text start="1379.42" dur="5.73">started we see Ebola right now being</text>
  <text start="1382.03" dur="4.97">pushed we can see them creating laws</text>
  <text start="1385.15" dur="4.62">take away the rights of the people</text>
  <text start="1387" dur="4.51">getting ready to go after those domestic</text>
  <text start="1389.77" dur="4.59">terrorists so all of this is starting to</text>
  <text start="1391.51" dur="4.08">really ramp up at this point in time and</text>
  <text start="1394.36" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the stock market</text>
  <text start="1395.59" dur="4.71">start to fluctuate now it&amp;#39;s up and it</text>
  <text start="1398.17" dur="3.99">comes straight down it goes up and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1400.3" dur="4.32">had a very bad day in the market today</text>
  <text start="1402.16" dur="4.38">and of course the stock market is the</text>
  <text start="1404.62" dur="3.51">last indicator of what the real economy</text>
  <text start="1406.54" dur="4.05">is doing and we can see what the real</text>
  <text start="1408.13" dur="4.44">economy is doing it is collapsing right</text>
  <text start="1410.59" dur="4.53">in front of us now the World Health</text>
  <text start="1412.57" dur="5.34">Organization they&amp;#39;re out there and they</text>
  <text start="1415.12" dur="5.46">are saying that countries should put</text>
  <text start="1417.91" dur="4.5">into place contingency plans to fight</text>
  <text start="1420.58" dur="3.72">Ebola because if it does break out</text>
  <text start="1422.41" dur="3.84">across Europe and into the United States</text>
  <text start="1424.3" dur="4.38">they need to have some type of plan and</text>
  <text start="1426.25" dur="5.25">as of right now it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the</text>
  <text start="1428.68" dur="4.89">US has any type of plan whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1431.5" dur="5.4">because look how the government handles</text>
  <text start="1433.57" dur="5.19">pretty much everything Katrina anything</text>
  <text start="1436.9" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s naturally occurring where they</text>
  <text start="1438.76" dur="4.02">really didn&amp;#39;t create the false flag</text>
  <text start="1440.56" dur="4.14">event the government really can&amp;#39;t handle</text>
  <text start="1442.78" dur="3.93">everything look they try to put up a</text>
  <text start="1444.7" dur="3.78">website for health insurance and they</text>
  <text start="1446.71" dur="4.47">want to manage your health insurance why</text>
  <text start="1448.48" dur="5.55">would we trust them to handle anything</text>
  <text start="1451.18" dur="4.98">they can&amp;#39;t even do anything right but</text>
  <text start="1454.03" dur="4.89">you can see right now everyone is going</text>
  <text start="1456.16" dur="4.44">to have to take care of themselves and I</text>
  <text start="1458.92" dur="4.19">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people writing me</text>
  <text start="1460.6" dur="4.65">telling me about colloidal silver I</text>
  <text start="1463.11" dur="4.81">decided to order some of it because</text>
  <text start="1465.25" dur="6.42">again I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of things about it</text>
  <text start="1467.92" dur="6.51">and I not taking any chances whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1471.67" dur="4.78">I rather take that than a vaccine from</text>
  <text start="1474.43" dur="3.61">the US government now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1476.45" dur="3.72">recommending this I do not sell it</text>
  <text start="1478.04" dur="4.14">whatsoever I&amp;#39;m just doing it for my</text>
  <text start="1480.17" dur="3.75">family to keep them safe things that</text>
  <text start="1482.18" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;ve read about it and things that I</text>
  <text start="1483.92" dur="3.93">know that people have been writing into</text>
  <text start="1485.54" dur="4.83">me this seems like something that I want</text>
  <text start="1487.85" dur="5.43">to have on hand in my preps so I have</text>
  <text start="1490.37" dur="7.53">ordered it and you might want to do the</text>
  <text start="1493.28" dur="8.16">same okay now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1497.9" dur="5.22">United States is sending troops into</text>
  <text start="1501.44" dur="4.08">West Africa looks like there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1503.12" dur="4.89">additional 1400 soldiers headed to</text>
  <text start="1505.52" dur="4.44">Liberia and we have to remember the US</text>
  <text start="1508.01" dur="3.51">ambassador to Liberia send yes all these</text>
  <text start="1509.96" dur="4.17">troops are not to take over the</text>
  <text start="1511.52" dur="5.73">government or out them I promise and</text>
  <text start="1514.13" dur="4.65">pretty much we&amp;#39;ve seen this before where</text>
  <text start="1517.25" dur="3.54">the government officials tell you one</text>
  <text start="1518.78" dur="5.22">thing and they do the actual opposite</text>
  <text start="1520.79" dur="5.28">and like I said this seems like a tactic</text>
  <text start="1524" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re using in West Africa now of</text>
  <text start="1526.07" dur="3.54">course they&amp;#39;re dealing some dealing with</text>
  <text start="1528.08" dur="3.84">something that could be spread all</text>
  <text start="1529.61" dur="3.99">around and they really it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="1531.92" dur="6.54">control and we can see already it</text>
  <text start="1533.6" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re losing control of it now in Hong</text>
  <text start="1538.46" dur="3.9">Kong it looks like the protesting is</text>
  <text start="1540.56" dur="3.96">continuing student leaders of the</text>
  <text start="1542.36" dur="4.14">pro-reform protests in Hong Kong have</text>
  <text start="1544.52" dur="3.9">come up with the ultimatum to the city&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1546.5" dur="3.45">chief saying if he doesn&amp;#39;t step down</text>
  <text start="1548.42" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ll start storming the government</text>
  <text start="1549.95" dur="3.09">buildings the protesters have already</text>
  <text start="1551.75" dur="3.66">fulfilled their earlier threat of</text>
  <text start="1553.04" dur="4.02">stepping up demonstrations in case their</text>
  <text start="1555.41" dur="5.07">demands aren&amp;#39;t met now we can see right</text>
  <text start="1557.06" dur="5.82">now that all of this is looking like the</text>
  <text start="1560.48" dur="4.02">US government is getting this whole</text>
  <text start="1562.88" dur="3.09">thing up there behind it they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1564.5" dur="3.99">to destabilize the government there</text>
  <text start="1565.97" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re trying to remove the government</text>
  <text start="1568.49" dur="6.03">in China and if they are successful in</text>
  <text start="1571.82" dur="4.23">doing this this would really devastate</text>
  <text start="1574.52" dur="3.42">the BRIC nations because they would just</text>
  <text start="1576.05" dur="4.29">pretty much remove it and you can see</text>
  <text start="1577.94" dur="4.98">why they&amp;#39;re doing this because China</text>
  <text start="1580.34" dur="5.43">right now is the enemy they have a lot</text>
  <text start="1582.92" dur="4.29">of gold they&amp;#39;re making deals all around</text>
  <text start="1585.77" dur="3.45">the world to become the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="1587.21" dur="4.95">of the world and the United States</text>
  <text start="1589.22" dur="4.65">central bankers now see China as the</text>
  <text start="1592.16" dur="3.9">enemy and you can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1593.87" dur="4.08">they are trying to push this as hard as</text>
  <text start="1596.06" dur="4.05">they can and if we look at the number of</text>
  <text start="1597.95" dur="6.09">countries that the United States went</text>
  <text start="1600.11" dur="5.85">into and try to overthrow the elected</text>
  <text start="1604.04" dur="5.07">government with a and put in place a</text>
  <text start="1605.96" dur="4.38">puppet regime it is a lot and the last</text>
  <text start="1609.11" dur="3.809">ones we&amp;#39;ve seen have been</text>
  <text start="1610.34" dur="5.79">Ukraine and the Middle East Russia is</text>
  <text start="1612.919" dur="7.321">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying yes that</text>
  <text start="1616.13" dur="7.35">that the the manifestations against</text>
  <text start="1620.24" dur="5.52">government oppression is organized by an</text>

  <text start="1625.76" dur="4.799">region Russia have declared the protest</text>
  <text start="1628.4" dur="5.07">in what protesters are calling umbrella</text>
  <text start="1630.559" dur="4.74">revolution an organized plot in which</text>
  <text start="1633.47" dur="4.38">agitators trained by the United States</text>
  <text start="1635.299" dur="6">government are trying to ferment hatred</text>
  <text start="1637.85" dur="5.459">against China and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1641.299" dur="4.561">United States does this to many many</text>
  <text start="1643.309" dur="5.61">countries Kerry is out there once again</text>
  <text start="1645.86" dur="6.059">saying that Hong Kong should show</text>
  <text start="1648.919" dur="5.221">restraint this is exactly what they said</text>
  <text start="1651.919" dur="4.11">in Ukraine the government in Ukraine</text>

  <text start="1657.44" dur="5.7">to speak democracy democracy freedom and</text>
  <text start="1660.169" dur="5.041">of course the Chinese counterpart said</text>
  <text start="1663.14" dur="3.93">listen mind your own business this is an</text>
  <text start="1665.21" dur="3.3">internal affair we know what you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1668.51" dur="6">so we&amp;#39;ll take care of it now the big</text>
  <text start="1671.69" dur="4.77">question here is remember and let&amp;#39;s keep</text>
  <text start="1674.51" dur="4.409">this in the back of our memory as our</text>
  <text start="1676.46" dur="5.37">government officials out there tell</text>
  <text start="1678.919" dur="4.74">those people democracy democracy that</text>
  <text start="1681.83" dur="4.05">people have the right because when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1683.659" dur="4.77">the people&amp;#39;s turn inside the United</text>
  <text start="1685.88" dur="4.74">States we need to repeat this back to</text>

  <text start="1690.62" dur="3.84">to speak out we have the freedom if we</text>
  <text start="1692.899" dur="3.991">don&amp;#39;t agree with the government we have</text>
  <text start="1694.46" dur="4.829">the right to remove them this is what we</text>
  <text start="1696.89" dur="7.32">need to use on them and use it back at</text>
  <text start="1699.289" dur="8.25">them when the time is right now it looks</text>
  <text start="1704.21" dur="5.939">like the US is draw launching joint</text>
  <text start="1707.539" dur="4.561">exercises with the Philippines 5,000</text>

  <text start="1727.25" dur="6.929">saying yes we understand what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1729.11" dur="9.12">doing this is clearly um done to target</text>
  <text start="1734.179" dur="5.551">China and these exercises are to contain</text>
  <text start="1738.23" dur="3.72">China and they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="1739.73" dur="3.84">situation and they realize what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1741.95" dur="2.1">on they realize the central bankers are</text>

  <text start="1747.41" dur="4.86">World War three will start and they will</text>
  <text start="1750.89" dur="2.85">be in it Russia will be in it North</text>
  <text start="1752.27" dur="3.75">Korea will be in it pretty much the</text>
  <text start="1753.74" dur="3.75">entire world will be in it because this</text>
  <text start="1756.02" dur="2.67">is the way the central bankers want it</text>
  <text start="1757.49" dur="3.39">because they need to cover up what is</text>
  <text start="1758.69" dur="5.76">going on here and that is the full</text>
  <text start="1760.88" dur="6.09">collapse of the system now it seems that</text>
  <text start="1764.45" dur="5.01">Russia has irrefutable evidence that the</text>

  <text start="1794.66" dur="7.1">they have prisons and we see this happen</text>
  <text start="1798.14" dur="5.97">quite often and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>

  <text start="1952.409" dur="5.76">trying to stop now it looks like France</text>
  <text start="1955.13" dur="5.5">is going to deploy three more fighter</text>
  <text start="1958.169" dur="7.951">jets and a frigate to fight the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1960.63" dur="9.87">state and the the new NATO leader says</text>

  <text start="1982.23" dur="5.52">attacked now why are they saying this at</text>
  <text start="1984.929" dur="5.461">this point well we know they&amp;#39;ve placed</text>
  <text start="1987.75" dur="6.36">their tanks on the border with Syria we</text>
  <text start="1990.39" dur="7.26">understand something is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1994.11" dur="5.58">that will allow Turkey to join the fight</text>

  <text start="2010.57" dur="5.64">is attacked all the other nations join</text>
  <text start="2013.96" dur="4.319">in and again we have to remember what</text>
  <text start="2016.21" dur="3.689">happened with Erdogan where he tried to</text>
  <text start="2018.279" dur="3.24">set up that false flag event where he</text>
  <text start="2019.899" dur="4.02">tried to stink his military soldiers</text>
  <text start="2021.519" dur="3.931">into Syria with missile launchers he</text>
  <text start="2023.919" dur="4.35">wanted them to fire missiles back into</text>
  <text start="2025.45" dur="6.12">Turkey to make it look like Syria was</text>
  <text start="2028.269" dur="6.181">attacking so NATO can implement article</text>
  <text start="2031.57" dur="5.699">5 and they were able to pretty much</text>
  <text start="2034.45" dur="4.92">invade Syria but this whole thing got</text>
  <text start="2037.269" dur="4.38">blown out of the water with Twitter and</text>
  <text start="2039.37" dur="4.769">YouTube and the whole false flag length</text>
  <text start="2041.649" dur="5.461">completely fell apart but arrogant is</text>
  <text start="2044.139" dur="4.53">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that Turkey</text>
  <text start="2047.11" dur="4.17">would fight against the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2048.669" dur="4.891">other terrorist groups in the region but</text>
  <text start="2051.28" dur="6.03">it would stick to its aim and that aim</text>
  <text start="2053.56" dur="5.9">is to remove Assad from power that is</text>
  <text start="2057.31" dur="4.859">our main goal and the United States is</text>
  <text start="2059.46" dur="4.149">focusing its efforts on defeating the</text>
  <text start="2062.169" dur="4.141">Islamic state right now but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2063.609" dur="4.23">saying that their main goal the United</text>
  <text start="2066.31" dur="5.309">States central bankers main goal is</text>
  <text start="2067.839" dur="6.601">still and has not changed their position</text>
  <text start="2071.619" dur="5.04">is to remove Assad we continue to</text>
  <text start="2074.44" dur="4.56">believe that Assad regime is a magnet</text>
  <text start="2076.659" dur="3.48">for terrorism despite the US position</text>
  <text start="2079" dur="3.45">that Assad must go</text>
  <text start="2080.139" dur="4.321">the current priority is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2082.45" dur="3.99">state well no it really isn&amp;#39;t what</text>
  <text start="2084.46" dur="4.439">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re targeting the</text>
  <text start="2086.44" dur="5.699">infrastructure of Syria to weaken it and</text>
  <text start="2088.899" dur="5.101">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now coming out of</text>
  <text start="2092.139" dur="4.53">veterans today there is an out and</text>
  <text start="2094" dur="4.859">analyst and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="2096.669" dur="4.801">Washington intends to inflict such</text>
  <text start="2098.859" dur="5.431">damage to the economic and industrial</text>
  <text start="2101.47" dur="4.77">infrastructure within Syria that any</text>
  <text start="2104.29" dur="4.079">Syrian government after fighting will be</text>
  <text start="2106.24" dur="4.52">so weakened that it will be vulnerable</text>
  <text start="2108.369" dur="4.831">to further attacks and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="2110.76" dur="4.42">what they&amp;#39;re doing and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2113.2" dur="4.379">continually do this now we understand</text>
  <text start="2115.18" dur="4.23">the Pentagon and the Obama</text>
  <text start="2117.579" dur="3.871">administration is saying that no we are</text>
  <text start="2119.41" dur="4.29">not hitting any type of civilians in the</text>
  <text start="2121.45" dur="5.1">area whatsoever and then they came out</text>
  <text start="2123.7" dur="4.919">with a statement like this a US policy</text>
  <text start="2126.55" dur="4.83">requiring the military to avoid civilian</text>
  <text start="2128.619" dur="6">casualties as much as possible does not</text>
  <text start="2131.38" dur="4.83">apply to the current operations in Syria</text>
  <text start="2134.619" dur="3.841">and Iraq and this is coming from a White</text>
  <text start="2136.21" dur="4.26">House official the policy will not apply</text>
  <text start="2138.46" dur="4.17">to the u.s. strikes in Syria the</text>
  <text start="2140.47" dur="3.12">near-certainty standard only applies</text>
  <text start="2142.63" dur="3.18">when we</text>
  <text start="2143.59" dur="4.56">take direct action outside areas of</text>
  <text start="2145.81" dur="3.99">active hostilities so basically what</text>
  <text start="2148.15" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re saying is we can hit civilians</text>
  <text start="2149.8" dur="3.93">it makes no difference and they are</text>
  <text start="2152.29" dur="2.88">hitting civilians there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="2153.73" dur="3.42">civilians that are dying from these</text>
  <text start="2155.17" dur="4.47">bombings and this is a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="2157.15" dur="3.36">the beheading the alleged beheadings you</text>
  <text start="2159.64" dur="4.14">know the fake ones</text>
  <text start="2160.51" dur="5.37">then then what the Islamic state you</text>
  <text start="2163.78" dur="5.01">know pretty much used as their</text>
  <text start="2165.88" dur="5.43">propaganda basically the US government</text>
  <text start="2168.79" dur="5.04">Israel UK use as their propaganda and we</text>
  <text start="2171.31" dur="5.55">can see they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re killing</text>
  <text start="2173.83" dur="7.23">innocent people with these bomb runs but</text>
  <text start="2176.86" dur="6.48">as we know this is all being done to</text>
  <text start="2181.06" dur="5.25">weaken the infrastructure of Syria and</text>
  <text start="2183.34" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re going to continue doing this now</text>
  <text start="2186.31" dur="6.66">we have congressman Rangel and he is now</text>
  <text start="2189.73" dur="6.21">calling for a war tax and he wants the</text>
  <text start="2192.97" dur="4.92">draft to be voted on so we can see they</text>
  <text start="2195.94" dur="4.26">are definitely prepping for war</text>
  <text start="2197.89" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re definitely prepping to implement</text>
  <text start="2200.2" dur="3.51">the draft and the draft is not just</text>
  <text start="2201.73" dur="4.71">going to be men it is going to be women</text>
  <text start="2203.71" dur="4.92">so it&amp;#39;s both going to be draft at this</text>
  <text start="2206.44" dur="5.49">time and we have to say at this point</text>
  <text start="2208.63" dur="5.97">when this starts going really of much</text>
  <text start="2211.93" dur="5.25">further and it&amp;#39;s accelerating we need to</text>
  <text start="2214.6" dur="5.64">put a stop to all of this and there will</text>
  <text start="2217.18" dur="5.67">be a point in time that we will have the</text>
  <text start="2220.24" dur="4.74">ability to say no we are not going along</text>
  <text start="2222.85" dur="5.1">with this and we need to get everybody</text>
  <text start="2224.98" dur="5.7">as many people as we possibly can and it</text>
  <text start="2227.95" dur="5.76">has to be in the millions to go to</text>
  <text start="2230.68" dur="6.15">Washington and people in Spain people in</text>
  <text start="2233.71" dur="5.52">UK people in Germany people in France</text>
  <text start="2236.83" dur="5.34">people in Australia people in Canada we</text>
  <text start="2239.23" dur="6.42">need to do this all at the same exact</text>
  <text start="2242.17" dur="6.18">time to let the central bankers know and</text>
  <text start="2245.65" dur="6.3">the government we are not fighting your</text>
  <text start="2248.35" dur="6.99">war now it looks like the Israeli</text>
  <text start="2251.95" dur="7.04">intelligence community is trying to</text>
  <text start="2255.34" dur="7.71">convince everyone that Assad still has a</text>
  <text start="2258.99" dur="8.2">huge amount of sarin gas and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2263.05" dur="6.84">holding on to it right now until the</text>
  <text start="2267.19" dur="6.27">very last minute because what they said</text>
  <text start="2269.89" dur="5.7">was they believe that the that the sarin</text>
  <text start="2273.46" dur="3.75">gas weapons would likely be deployed if</text>
  <text start="2275.59" dur="3.54">the Assad regime</text>
  <text start="2277.21" dur="4.68">faced an imminent threat to its survival</text>
  <text start="2279.13" dur="6.33">so you can see what they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="2281.89" dur="7.35">here they&amp;#39;re going to use this as a</text>
  <text start="2285.46" dur="6.84">false flag event to show that Assad</text>
  <text start="2289.24" dur="6.03">still has chemical weapons and this</text>
  <text start="2292.3" dur="4.44">could be used to say ah now we can go</text>
  <text start="2295.27" dur="3.15">into Syria and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="2296.74" dur="4.35">watch this very very carefully because</text>
  <text start="2298.42" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re continually out there pushing</text>
  <text start="2301.09" dur="5.91">this story that he still has chemical</text>
  <text start="2305.17" dur="3.54">weapons and he&amp;#39;s going to use them and</text>
  <text start="2307" dur="3.03">they don&amp;#39;t know where he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="2308.71" dur="2.13">it but it&amp;#39;s going to be a last-ditch</text>
