  <text start="126.869" dur="5.281">doors will be behind closed doors we</text>
  <text start="130.35" dur="3.96">know that leaks most likely will be</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="5.1">forthcoming because it seems like this</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="4.38">is standard operating procedures and the</text>

  <text start="138.69" dur="4.98">information now there are a couple of</text>
  <text start="141" dur="5.94">questions that we need to answer first</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.33">who is bill priest M why was Devon Nunez</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="6.03">so confident when it released the memo</text>
  <text start="149" dur="5.92">why did all the GOP HP s CI members</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="7.35">happily allow the Democrats to create</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="7.95">attempt a generic why was this well bill</text>

  <text start="162.87" dur="5.67">this how do we know this well his name</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="3.84">is not really mentioned they kind of</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="3.87">leave his name out when they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="170.579" dur="4.711">about it they talk about it position but</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="6.21">they never really mentioned his name we</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="6.51">also know that he was Peter stroszek</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="5.399">direct boss if anyone in Congress really</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="3.689">wanted to know if the FBI paid for the</text>
  <text start="184.019" dur="2.641">Christopher steel dossier</text>
  <text start="185.489" dur="3.721">well briefs</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="6.15">bill pre-snap is the guy who would know</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="6.63">everything about everything so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="5.88">over this bill pre-snap is number one</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.02">before getting demoted Peter stroszek</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="4.74">was number two</text>
  <text start="199.86" dur="6.27">the investigation into Donald Trump was</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="5.97">a counterintelligence operation and that</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="5.73">operation began in July 2016 pre stab</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="4.34">would have been in charge of that along</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="3.32">with all other FBI counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="213.74" dur="4.78">operations</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="6.09">Peter stroszek was specifically in</text>
  <text start="218.52" dur="5.13">charge of the Trump counter-intel up</text>
  <text start="221.27" dur="5.92">stroszek would it be reporting to</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="7.58">pre-snap on every detail and couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="7.74">make a move without pre steps approval</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="6.01">on March 20th 2017 congressional</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="4.89">testimony James Comey was asked why the</text>
  <text start="237.24" dur="4.29">FBI director did not inform</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="3.78">congressional oversight about the</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="5.76">counterintelligence operation that began</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="5.67">in July 2016 Comey said he did not tell</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="3.96">congressional oversight he was</text>
  <text start="249.27" dur="4.59">investigating presidential candidate</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="5.16">Trump because the dirt the director of</text>
  <text start="253.86" dur="5.72">counterintelligence suggested he not do</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="6.45">so now this is a very important detail</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="9.37">because he doesn&amp;#39;t mention his name he</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="8.85">just mentions the title his position so</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="6.81">we have the FBI director James Comey</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="5.79">telling Congress on March 20th 2017 that</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="4.26">the reason he didn&amp;#39;t form the statutory</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="3.56">oversight gang of eight was because</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="4.35">pre-snap</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="5.65">recommended he didn&amp;#39;t do it apparently</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.89">according to Comey pre-snap carries a</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.28">great deal of influence if he could get</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="5.97">his boss to not perform a statutory</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="6.84">obligation simply by recommending he</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="6.3">doesn&amp;#39;t do it then again commis blame</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="6.35">casting there is really called creating</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="7.7">a full guy Comey was ducking</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="6.94">responsibility in March 2017 by blaming</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="5.95">pre-snap for not informing Congress of</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="7.41">the operation that began in July of 2016</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="8.43">nine months prior in essence</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="5.76">pre-snap was James commis fall guy we</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="5.24">knew at the time that pre-snap would</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="6.75">likely see this the same way the guy</text>
  <text start="328.85" dur="6.12">would have too much to lose by allowing</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="5.63">Co me to set him up</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="6.82">so pre-snap</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="6.43">might have flipped why would he take the</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="4.62">fall for the operation when there were</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="4.17">multiple people around the upper levels</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="4.61">of leadership who carried out the</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="3.99">operation and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="5.29">pre-snap</text>
  <text start="352.26" dur="5.88">he has money and I don&amp;#39;t think he wants</text>
  <text start="356.31" dur="4.17">to lose any of it and I don&amp;#39;t think he</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="4.29">wants to take the fall for this and if</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="3.96">you really think about this pre-snap</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="3.96">would have needed to authorize stroszek</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="4.14">to engage with Christopher Steele over</text>
  <text start="366.39" dur="4.529">the Russian dossier he would have needed</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="4.53">to approve of the underlying</text>
  <text start="370.919" dur="5.991">investigation process used for both FISA</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="6.42">applications June 2016 October 21st 2016</text>
  <text start="376.91" dur="4.78">he would be the person to approve of</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="3.3">arranging paying and reimbursing</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="2.52">Christopher Steele for the Russian</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="3.06">dossier used in their</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="4.41">counterintelligence operation and</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="5.88">subsequent FISA application without</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="4.38">pre-snap involved approvals the entire</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="4.95">Russian Trump counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.91">operation just doesn&amp;#39;t happen everyone</text>
  <text start="396.72" dur="4.79">around pre-snap above and below were</text>
  <text start="398.91" dur="5.46">caught inside the investigative net</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="6.19">pre-snap made the decision after commis</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="6.15">testimony on March 20th 2017 when he</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="5.73">realized what was coming so he flipped</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="5.55">and you have to remember like I said</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="5.57">before he&amp;#39;s well off financially he has</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="6.84">too much to lose he and his wife Sabina</text>
  <text start="419" dur="6.43">Menchel live a comfortable life in a 3.8</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="6.96">million DC home she comes from a family</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="7.83">of money it&amp;#39;s all making sense now when</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="6.63">Devin Nunez interviewed pre-snap</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="6.92">and Jim rebecky prior to putting out the</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="7.59">memo process into place Rebecca quit</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="8.35">pre-snap went back to work</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="6.65">and to this day pre-snap remains the</text>
  <text start="448.53" dur="5.37">assistant FBI director in charge of</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="6.88">counterintelligence operation so right</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="6.96">now we know that pre-snap is having</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="5.37">discussions behind closed doors and new</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="3.9">nests and the rest they already knew</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="4.35">that he flipped</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.05">they gave him information this is why</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="7.35">they were confident putting out the memo</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="6.78">and at this point it could be over for</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="4.5">Comey</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="6.87">and the rest and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="5.55">walls are closing in and they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="482.46" dur="4.769">in very very fast and a lot of these</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="4.2">individuals they might not want to take</text>
  <text start="487.229" dur="3.871">the fall for what has been happening and</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="5.13">they might squeal on others they might</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="4.89">suicide themselves or they might run so</text>
  <text start="494.07" dur="4.86">this is something that we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="4.92">for and everything is coming out in the</text>
  <text start="498.93" dur="4.14">open and we&amp;#39;re gonna get a lot more</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="4.83">information and we can see that things</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="5.73">are progressing very very rapidly</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="6.09">we see at the same time that this is all</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="5.7">happening governments and social media</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="4.5">companies they&amp;#39;re collaborating to</text>
  <text start="514.5" dur="4.32">censor anyone that would dare question</text>
  <text start="516.33" dur="4.5">mainstream media narratives we see out</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="3.54">in France right now they have a law that</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re proposing that would give</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="4.08">authorities the power to immediately</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="4.949">halt the publication an information</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="5.79">deemed to be false well how do they know</text>
  <text start="528.959" dur="5.461">it&amp;#39;s false well they will decide they</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="4.41">will decide if it is false just like</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="4.68">Facebook where they had the fast check</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="4.92">fact checkers we know Google was trying</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="4.35">to use different methods of trying to</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="3.99">figure out how they can say that this</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="3.57">information is trying to remember most</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="2.85">of the time where they&amp;#39;re checking all</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="3.93">the information that they&amp;#39;re checking it</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="4.77">goes back to the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="6.329">it goes back to the propaganda outlets</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="6.6">and it confirms their stories I mean if</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="3.531">you really think about it go back in</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="3.48">time</text>
  <text start="560.81" dur="5.74">anyone who countered the Russian</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="6.6">collusion story that was fake news the</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="5.58">corporate media had the real story but</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="4.89">now it turns out that the corporate</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="5.82">media had nothing they lied about it</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="5.19">they made stuff up that is the fake news</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="5.04">and everyone that countered the Russian</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="4.59">collusion that was the real news and we</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="3.72">know that Muller he hasn&amp;#39;t found</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="5.55">anything yet everything he&amp;#39;s doing with</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="6.18">mana fort has nothing to do with Russian</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="4.86">collusion and he&amp;#39;s still going after</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="4.44">mana for now q has come out and he said</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="4.5">that mana Ford is a plant and I think</text>
  <text start="597.33" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re just Muller is just putting</text>
  <text start="599.43" dur="4.65">things out there just to put things out</text>
  <text start="601.68" dur="3.9">there and judges have already said this</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="3.81">has nothing to do with Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="605.58" dur="4.32">show us information that has to do with</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="5.54">Russian collusion they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="609.9" dur="7.2">anything even the European Union they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="7.27">pushing their laws into place to shut</text>
  <text start="617.1" dur="5.31">down anyone that counters what the</text>
  <text start="620.7" dur="3.81">corporate media is saying or what the</text>
  <text start="622.41" dur="3.69">government is saying the same thing here</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="3.75">in the United States we have YouTube we</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="4.95">have Google Facebook Twitter and the</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="5.01">rest where they&amp;#39;re creating new systems</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="4.47">to try to shut down that they try to</text>
  <text start="633.27" dur="4.92">other systems in the past Facebook is</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="5.13">moved from their new stories now to</text>
  <text start="638.19" dur="4.2">breaking news stories they got rid of</text>
  <text start="640.65" dur="3.96">their fact checkers they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="642.39" dur="4.74">have the people vote which are the</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="4.8">reputable media outlets and of course</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="3.27">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re all one in</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="2.52">the same so it really makes no</text>
  <text start="650.4" dur="3.15">difference whatsoever which one you pick</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re all going to repeat the same</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="5.46">exact stories and once again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="4.05">trying to figure out a way to counter</text>
  <text start="659.01" dur="3.72">everything remember if you go back in</text>
  <text start="660.27" dur="4.52">time before the internet they were able</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="4.05">to control the flow of information</text>
  <text start="664.79" dur="4.81">because there are only a certain number</text>
  <text start="666.78" dur="4.77">of news outlets and they controlled all</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="3.93">of them and it was very easy to control</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="3.45">now with the internet many people are</text>
  <text start="673.53" dur="2.97">doing research many people are looking</text>
  <text start="675" dur="3.33">into things many people are reporting on</text>
  <text start="676.5" dur="4.02">things and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="678.33" dur="4.65">information out there we see the North</text>
  <text start="680.52" dur="5.28">Korean summits they are moving forward</text>
  <text start="682.98" dur="5.28">and right now Pompeo is saying listen we</text>
  <text start="685.8" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t want Boulton involved in the North</text>
  <text start="688.26" dur="4.89">Korean talks and again I believe Bolton</text>
  <text start="690.99" dur="4.65">was brought on for one reason and one</text>
  <text start="693.15" dur="4.98">reason only two wants the NIA comes to</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="5.46">watch how they move how they operate</text>
  <text start="698.13" dur="5.49">what they&amp;#39;re doing basically the</text>
