  <text start="53.449" dur="6.691">episode 1191 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="56.78" dur="5.91">january thirtieth 2017 and the title of</text>
  <text start="60.14" dur="5.82">the episode is economic indicators show</text>
  <text start="62.69" dur="7.14">clear signs the economy is slipping into</text>
  <text start="65.96" dur="6.93">a depression let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="69.83" dur="5.91">collapse financial news today on the</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="6.36">market we see that well we were above</text>
  <text start="75.74" dur="7.47">20,000 now we&amp;#39;re below 20,000 and we</text>
  <text start="79.25" dur="6.81">need to remember that the insiders they</text>
  <text start="83.21" dur="5.49">understand what is happening they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="6.18">been selling their stock to retail</text>
  <text start="88.7" dur="6.27">investors and we can see as we move</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="6.239">forward throughout this year most likely</text>
  <text start="94.97" dur="5.819">the market will probably start to drop</text>
  <text start="98.479" dur="5.28">dramatically I mean many people and</text>
  <text start="100.789" dur="5.041">individuals are calling for this and we</text>
  <text start="103.759" dur="4.65">can see the corporate media they are</text>
  <text start="105.83" dur="4.649">calling this Trump euphoria making us</text>
  <text start="108.409" dur="5.011">feel like Trump is the one who caused</text>
  <text start="110.479" dur="5.341">all this for the market to go up and we</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="5.129">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="4.589">prepared for this market to come down</text>
  <text start="118.549" dur="5.731">because this is a classic bubble</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="5.431">situation where the market goes up there</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="4.29">telling you that good times are here</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="4.83">again and then the insiders start to</text>
  <text start="128.57" dur="4.139">sell hundreds and hundreds of millions</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="3.36">of dollars to retail investors who</text>
  <text start="132.709" dur="3.15">believe the markets going to continually</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="3.329">move up and then as the market comes</text>
  <text start="135.859" dur="4.041">down those same insight or short the</text>
  <text start="137.359" dur="5.611">market and make a profit on both sides</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="4.98">but of course the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="142.97" dur="5.299">separate and apart from all of this and</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="7.18">the economy right now is doing terribly</text>
  <text start="148.269" dur="7.411">but we do see the US and UK we see Trump</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="9.209">and Theresa May they have begun talks</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="7.899">about trade now the EU rules say members</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="4.741">cannot negotiate trade deals until they</text>
  <text start="163.579" dur="5.071">completely exit from the block and until</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s finalized but it looks like Theresa</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="5.52">May and president Trump well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.83">waiting for this whatsoever they realize</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="6.83">that this is going to happen no matter</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="8.75">what and they&amp;#39;re testing the limits</text>
  <text start="181" dur="8.15">of the EU rules now nothing has been</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="6.66">done nothing has been set in stone and</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="5.71">you have to understand what is the true</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="6.36">motivation of Trump and why is he</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="9.21">pushing this right now is he trying to</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="8.07">assist in the collapse of the EU and it</text>
  <text start="204.07" dur="5.4">looks like he&amp;#39;s pushing this idea that</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.16">yet it&amp;#39;s already said and done the EU is</text>
  <text start="209.47" dur="6.09">done and we&amp;#39;re going to be making great</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="6.39">deals with the UK and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="6.179">how that turns out later on here in the</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="6.63">United States what do we see well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="4.711">starting to see that the people who are</text>
  <text start="224.83" dur="3.629">believing the hype in the corporate</text>
  <text start="226.45" dur="5.13">media where they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="6.631">that the economy seems positive we get</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="4.56">all these soft surveys about confidence</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="2.79">and everything else saying that</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="3.65">everything is fantastic everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="4.89">confidence is up so people are out there</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="4.75">spending a lot more money than they</text>
  <text start="242.77" dur="5.52">actually have now it really started</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="5.61">before Trump was even president because</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="4.53">this is the ninth straight month in a</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="5.73">row where people are continually</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="5.07">spending and they&amp;#39;re spending a lot more</text>
  <text start="255.88" dur="4.32">than they&amp;#39;re actually bringing in that</text>
  <text start="257.89" dur="5.88">means they&amp;#39;re charging a lot of this</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="6.17">stuff and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that for</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="6.84">the ninth month in row spending is</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="8.53">rising and savings well that&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="270.61" dur="6.809">and we can see at this point that people</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="5.82">are coming are caught up right now in</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="7.141">this frenzy of everything&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="280.72" dur="5.52">okay and when we really look at the</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="3.51">economy and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at it for</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="3.39">quite a while we&amp;#39;ve been looking at GDP</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="3.45">we know those are completely fake for me</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="4.59">and false we know the GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="5.49">below zero percent in the negative range</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="6.72">negative 1 negative 2 percent net area</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="6.78">we also understand that housing is</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="5.46">declining retail is in major contraction</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="4.35">and I know that there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="2.61">corporations who have been talking to</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="2.31">Trump saying that we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="3.719">bringing jobs back to the United States</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="3.6">but when we look at this how could this</text>
  <text start="312.729" dur="4.891">be possible</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="4.649">in this type of economy well it&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="2.88">very very difficult because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.699" dur="4.021">letting off at the same exact time and</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="4.59">everything is contracting at the same</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="5.21">exact time which means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.09" dur="4.799">planning for something afterwards</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="3.579">Starbucks is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="329.889" dur="5.96">they&amp;#39;re planning to hire about 10,000</text>
  <text start="331.509" dur="8.041">refugees over a five-year period and</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="5.861">again does that help everyone today no</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="3.869">it really does not when we look at all</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="3.54">these companies who say they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="3.81">be building manufacturing plants hiring</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.879">people does that help people right now</text>
  <text start="347.229" dur="7.141">no so we need to look at this and say</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="4.85">okay when is this going to occur because</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.079">we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more companies</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="7.75">continually layoff ship it well their</text>
  <text start="360.449" dur="4.631">sales they&amp;#39;re dropping they&amp;#39;re laying</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="5">off about a hundred and ten employees</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="6.63">about six percent of their workforce and</text>
  <text start="368.729" dur="5.921">things are not growing great there we</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="5.269">see in the US auto industry well it</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="5.22">looks like the bubble is about to burst</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="6.041">despite record US auto sales last year</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="6.18">the number of vehicles on car dealer</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="7.23">lots remains near record highs JD power</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="7.019">analysis Tom King warned 26 ended 2016</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="6">ended with an inventory bubble that will</text>
  <text start="393.069" dur="8.16">require less production or more</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="8.039">incentives to clear it and the number of</text>
  <text start="401.229" dur="6.93">vehicles which are sitting in dealer</text>
  <text start="404.289" dur="7.231">lives is about 3.9 million vehicles this</text>
  <text start="408.159" dur="5.581">is problematic about one-third of</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="5.759">inventory were older model year vehicles</text>
  <text start="413.74" dur="9.03">and what this means is in the past when</text>
  <text start="417.279" dur="7.711">things were not manipulated there was</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="4.44">less than a quarter of these type of</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="5.07">cars on the lot so we have new cars</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="4.829">coming in and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="3.599">problem now Trump he&amp;#39;s out there and</text>
  <text start="432.039" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s pressuring the auto industry to</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="6.63">bring back more jobs more manufacturing</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="8.821">have more production but right now the</text>
  <text start="440.289" dur="5.581">sales don&amp;#39;t call for it and again this</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="3.3">is a major</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="8.93">them in this economy where it&amp;#39;s built up</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="10.56">on illusion on manipulation on complete</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="7.33">dishonesty it is very difficult to</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="5.58">restart the system the system needs to</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="4.77">be cleared first it needs to be cleared</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="4.35">of all this debt it needs to be cleared</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="5.42">of all this dishonesty of these</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="6.3">manipulated numbers and until we do that</text>
  <text start="472.32" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s going to be very very difficult to</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="6.57">restart this system we see Citigroup</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="6.72">right now well they are dumping their</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="5.22">mortgage business Citigroup says it</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="5.43">would sell its mortgage servicing rights</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="6.27">on about 780,000 Fannie Mae and frama</text>

  <text start="501.07" dur="6.83">are expected to be transferred to loan</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="6.09">servicing provider sin lar FSB and</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to get completely out of</text>
  <text start="510.37" dur="5.43">the mortgage business by 2018 which</text>
  <text start="513.16" dur="5.91">should tell you something we have major</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="5.85">problems in the housing market things</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="5.22">are deteriorating very rapidly and the</text>
  <text start="521.65" dur="5.16">bank&amp;#39;s well they&amp;#39;re jumping ship they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="4.44">protecting themselves and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="4.32">seeing right now is that there are clear</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="5.73">indicators that the US economy is</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="5.49">slipping into a depression and when we</text>
  <text start="534.46" dur="5.45">look at these indicators we can see that</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="8.79">things are not going well whatsoever</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="7.84">when we look at GDP we know GDP is below</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="7.34">zero percent negative 1 negative 2</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="7.92">percent credit card company capital one</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="7.51">reported a thirty percent increase in</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="6.54">charge off year over a year Goldman</text>
  <text start="560.26" dur="4.41">Sachs has confirmed that US auto demand</text>
  <text start="562.21" dur="4.98">well it&amp;#39;s peaked and now it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="6.84">and we can see that by the number of</text>
  <text start="567.19" dur="6.9">cars on the lot the insider cell by</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="5.37">ratio hit fifty nine to one meaning</text>
  <text start="574.09" dur="5.31">insiders are dumping 59 shares for</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="6.84">everyone share</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="7.95">they buy tax revenues are showing a</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="7.35">marked collapse and taxes collected put</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="6.69">it simply it is evident from all of this</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="7.05">and many other indicators that we are</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="9.03">heading into a major depression scenario</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="9.21">and of course the media buzz is out</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="9.14">there saying that US gdp a five percent</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="8.61">is just around the corner how possibly</text>
  <text start="612.21" dur="6.61">can we hit five percent when we couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="5.76">even hit three percent actually if we go</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="5.76">back to what the IFF IMF predicted over</text>
  <text start="621.7" dur="4.05">time year after year after year they</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="3.3">told us we&amp;#39;re going to be hitting three</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="5.04">point five percent almost every single</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="5.28">year when they downgraded it throughout</text>
  <text start="630.79" dur="5.13">the year and when we look back at each</text>
  <text start="633.16" dur="8.93">year we couldn&amp;#39;t really get over two</text>
  <text start="635.92" dur="8.7">percent we were in the one-percent range</text>
  <text start="642.09" dur="6.75">so when they talk about how great things</text>
  <text start="644.62" dur="7.68">are going to get how can they get better</text>
  <text start="648.84" dur="7.15">they can&amp;#39;t not while retail is</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="7.17">contracting not while we have this debt</text>
  <text start="655.99" dur="6.06">not while people are unemployed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="4.65">not 10,000 people unemployed it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="662.05" dur="3.99">50,000 people unemployed it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="6.99">hundred thousand that are unemployed</text>
  <text start="666.04" dur="9.54">it&amp;#39;s 93 million people that&amp;#39;s how many</text>
  <text start="671.11" dur="7.38">jobs we&amp;#39;re going to have to create to</text>
  <text start="675.58" dur="4.5">get the ball rolling even if we created</text>
  <text start="678.49" dur="4.59">a hundred and fifty thousand jobs right</text>
  <text start="680.08" dur="5.88">now it&amp;#39;s not going to help because the</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="5.07">dead continually Rises we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="685.96" dur="3.51">Trump does come March most likely who</text>
  <text start="688.15" dur="5.31">will raise the debt ceiling because</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="5.37">otherwise the government won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="693.46" dur="4.56">to pay anything now if that does happen</text>
  <text start="694.84" dur="4.83">guess what the debt continually moves up</text>
  <text start="698.02" dur="5.85">and up and up and up they can&amp;#39;t stop it</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="7.71">and this is why it&amp;#39;s either we continue</text>
  <text start="703.87" dur="5.43">on this path or we say okay that&amp;#39;s it we</text>
  <text start="707.38" dur="4.95">need to go bankrupt here we need to wipe</text>
  <text start="709.3" dur="3.54">out all this debt we need to reset</text>
  <text start="712.33" dur="3.45">everything</text>
  <text start="712.84" dur="6.3">and I believe this is what is being</text>
  <text start="715.78" dur="4.92">planned at this point because we can see</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="3.93">that we cannot continue on with this</text>
  <text start="720.7" dur="3.78">even Trump&amp;#39;s budget director is out</text>
  <text start="723.07" dur="4.05">there saying that visit the debt is</text>
  <text start="724.48" dur="6.15">unsustainable just won&amp;#39;t work I know and</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="5.1">we can see that Trump is cutting the</text>
  <text start="730.63" dur="3.57">government is going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="732.22" dur="5.04">quite a number of people and the EPA I</text>
  <text start="734.2" dur="4.59">things about 7,500 people they might let</text>
  <text start="737.26" dur="3.15">go and there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="738.79" dur="4.58">others in government they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
