  <text start="601.29" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s that simple</text>
  <text start="602.7" dur="6.21">and the mainstream media is out there</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="5.1">saying how people love it this is an</text>
  <text start="608.91" dur="4.32">incredible thing and we know what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.55" dur="4.41">going to be used for think about your</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="4.01">phone today on how they can hear you and</text>
  <text start="615.96" dur="3.71">track you and they know where you are</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="5.02">the problem is if you forget your phone</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to track you</text>
  <text start="622.26" dur="4.5">they they can&amp;#39;t get that information</text>
  <text start="623.69" dur="7.03">think about if you had a device on you</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="6.39">or in you at all times they can track</text>
  <text start="630.72" dur="5.73">you they know exactly what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="633.15" dur="6.87">and who knows this device might be able</text>
  <text start="636.45" dur="5.76">to read your vital signs and everything</text>
  <text start="640.02" dur="5.46">else which will be transmitted to these</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="5.91">individuals so you can kiss privacy</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="5.76">goodbye because once you have this</text>
  <text start="648.12" dur="5.58">implant in you it&amp;#39;s game over now</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="5.46">remember they&amp;#39;re using companies and</text>
  <text start="653.7" dur="4.5">employees to do this because I believe</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="3.27">what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="658.2" dur="3.42">saying listen if you want a job and you</text>
  <text start="659.97" dur="4.83">want to work here you need to have this</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="5.04">implanted and I think every job what</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is say ok everyone</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="4.32">is required to have this if you would</text>
  <text start="668.7" dur="5.19">like to work for our company and this is</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="5.28">why they&amp;#39;re doing this through companies</text>
  <text start="673.89" dur="4.95">right now so we can see right now this</text>
  <text start="676.26" dur="6.63">has been their agenda and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="678.84" dur="6.74">trying to push that same goal we see out</text>
  <text start="682.89" dur="5.31">in Afghanistan we know that Ghani has</text>
  <text start="685.58" dur="5.56">offered the Taliban about three months</text>
  <text start="688.2" dur="4.71">of a ceasefire and of course if the</text>
  <text start="691.14" dur="3.78">Taliban agrees there would be a</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="4.95">ceasefire but if they don&amp;#39;t agree the</text>
  <text start="694.92" dur="5.37">ceasefire is off and we see Pompeo is</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="5.88">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that yes we</text>
  <text start="700.29" dur="6.12">need peace right now it&amp;#39;s time for peace</text>
  <text start="703.74" dur="5.37">and the Taliban should look at this and</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="4.83">they should maybe go along with this</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="4.05">ceasefire deal now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="711.24" dur="4.29">interesting is that the Taliban has</text>
  <text start="713.16" dur="5.13">accepted the invitation to attend</text>
