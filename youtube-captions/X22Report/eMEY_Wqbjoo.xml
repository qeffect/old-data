  <text start="49.46" dur="5.07">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="4.71">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="54.53" dur="6.119">episode 1165 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.89" dur="4.919">December 29th 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="60.649" dur="5.191">the episode is the elite just made their</text>
  <text start="62.809" dur="6.511">move against Russia using lies and fake</text>
  <text start="65.84" dur="5.94">news let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="69.32" dur="6.77">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="71.78" dur="7.619">now as we move into 2017 and Trump is</text>
  <text start="76.09" dur="5.77">sworn in and he moves into the White</text>
  <text start="79.399" dur="4.5">House and takes control we see that</text>
  <text start="81.86" dur="6.539">Republicans well they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="83.899" dur="6.901">to repeal Obamacare now they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="88.399" dur="3.871">a plan right now to replace it but what</text>
  <text start="90.8" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re saying is they&amp;#39;re gonna get rid</text>
  <text start="92.27" dur="5.82">of bits and pieces of it that make no</text>
  <text start="95.99" dur="3.9">sense whatsoever I mean the first piece</text>
  <text start="98.09" dur="4.5">that they get they need to get rid of is</text>
  <text start="99.89" dur="4.92">the penalties if you decide not to take</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="5.55">the insurance which is completely</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="6.509">unconstitutional other parts that they</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="5.7">might keep are provisions that let</text>
  <text start="111.319" dur="6.33">people under the age of 26 remain on</text>
  <text start="113.84" dur="6.11">their parents plan and we could see</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s gonna be a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="6.73">taking away taxpayer-funded freebies</text>
  <text start="123.649" dur="4.731">because that is very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="126.68" dur="3.839">because once people are receiving it</text>
  <text start="128.38" dur="4.12">they don&amp;#39;t like to give it up and the</text>
  <text start="130.519" dur="5.75">government doesn&amp;#39;t like to take it away</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="6">because it puts a bad light on them and</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="3.851">we can see that there are certain</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="9.06">individuals in government that use this</text>
  <text start="140.12" dur="10.86">concept to give out freebies and expand</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="6">the federal government and the</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="5.009">government that moves in afterwards or</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="3.75">after that or after that they have a</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="2.731">very tough time saying you know</text>
  <text start="157.31" dur="3.959">something we can&amp;#39;t do this anymore</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="4.35">and this has been the problem since the</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="4.5">beginning and this is why the government</text>
  <text start="163.07" dur="4.41">has grown so big and they&amp;#39;ve spent so</text>
  <text start="165.769" dur="4.201">much money but when we look at Obamacare</text>
  <text start="167.48" dur="5.759">right now we see the premiums in 24</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="9.6">states they&amp;#39;re over 20 percent this year</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="8.101">in 24 States half the country and this</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="3.01">was supposed to be affordable</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="5.11">which it is</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="7.59">not we see out in Germany Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="6.9">well she is really pushing the Ministry</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="6.81">of Truth out in her country we know 2017</text>
  <text start="193.35" dur="7.92">is an election year for her and she is</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="6.87">pushing this new plan where social media</text>
  <text start="201.27" dur="4.53">giants like Facebook and Twitter they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="4.8">going to be fined about five hundred and</text>
  <text start="205.8" dur="6.06">twenty-two thousand dollars per day for</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="7.29">leaving fake news online on their</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="6.36">services now we can see what&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="6.59">what what she&amp;#39;s trying to do here she</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="8.88">wants anything that is not in line with</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="9.37">her party to be taking down anyone that</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="6.69">contradicts her party the government or</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="5.13">anything else for any story that comes</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="7.38">out of her area she wants it taken down</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="6.54">and she&amp;#39;s calling everything fake which</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.78">is absolutely ridiculous because just</text>
  <text start="243.57" dur="5.1">because someone has a different</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="6.18">viewpoint doesn&amp;#39;t make it fake we see</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="5.52">the United States is out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.19">pushing more propaganda that North Korea</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="7.65">may possess another missile launching</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="7.71">site at a village which is suspected of</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="5.4">having nuclear facilities they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="6.03">know for sure they are alleging they</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="6.57">have no real evidence they shot some</text>
  <text start="270.06" dur="5.76">blurry satellite images that really show</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="3.54">absolutely nothing and at this point</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="3.81">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="3.6">trying to push the propaganda and the</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="3.93">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re famous for doing this where they</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="5.34">like to push out the propaganda make</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="6.9">people think in a certain way without</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="7.59">any real evidence we see out in Syria</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="5.64">right now there is a ceasefire deal what</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="6.36">does it cover well it covers the</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="7.37">moderate rebels it does not cover the</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="5.81">Islamic state it does not cover</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="8.23">al-nusrah it does not cover any</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="7.27">terrorist group Russia Turkey they were</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="5.069">able to talk</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="6.63">the seven major rebel groups which have</text>
  <text start="319.259" dur="7.801">about 60,000 fighters and they are now</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="5.94">in line with this ceasefire so what are</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="4.02">the mechanics for enforcing the truce</text>
  <text start="328.5" dur="5.19">well they haven&amp;#39;t really been revealed</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="4.26">but what they&amp;#39;re saying is that Turkey</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="3.72">and Russia Syria</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ll be enforcing this and what</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="5.599">happens if somebody violates it they are</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="9.03">automatically considered a terrorist and</text>
  <text start="343.009" dur="7.021">they&amp;#39;re free to go after now we see</text>
  <text start="348.63" dur="4.73">right now that the United States was not</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="7.93">involved in this whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="353.36" dur="6.13">Russia understands Syria understands</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="3.53">that if United States government central</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="4.26">bankers were involved in these talks</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="5.11">they would have broken down they have</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="4.169">gotten nowhere and this is why they left</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="5.099">the United States out because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="8.161">tired of dealing with these individuals</text>
  <text start="371.699" dur="5.72">who lie cheat do not keep their word we</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="7.019">see the u.s. is sending an additional</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="7.211">200 troops to Syria and you have to</text>
  <text start="383.099" dur="4.921">remember why they&amp;#39;re doing this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="6.33">true still trying to carve out that area</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="7.38">in Syria they&amp;#39;re still trying to hold on</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="6.87">to a little piece of this area in Syria</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="4.079">and we can see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="4.67">government the Russian government they</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="4.171">are sweeping through the country and</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="3.28">Turkey</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="3.54">well they pointed the finger at the</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="3.05">United States government central banker</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="4.409">the coalition forces and said listen</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="4.869">they had something to do with the</text>
  <text start="411.599" dur="4.261">Islamic state they created the Islamic</text>
  <text start="413.699" dur="4.891">state they supported the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="3.77">they funded it they supplied them with</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="5.009">weapons</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="5.86">Derwin said he had evidence and we also</text>
  <text start="423.599" dur="4.171">have to remember that Erwin was also</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="5.16">part of this and most likely that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="6">he has the evidence but he was in line</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="5.46">with the coalition forces where they</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="4.709">supported the Islamic state where they</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="5.85">made money or for the oil that they</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="6.511">stole from Syria we know that Erwin</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="5.34">housed the Islamic state and may had</text>
  <text start="444.99" dur="4.739">them move in and out of the borders</text>
  <text start="447.3" dur="3.66">between Syria and Turkey so there</text>
  <text start="449.729" dur="2.701">all involved in this and what was</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="3.479">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="3.359">taking sides and they&amp;#39;re pointing the</text>
  <text start="454.439" dur="3.421">fingers and of course United States is</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="4.291">out there saying no we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="5.639">supported the Islamic state we do not</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="6.989">create the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="463.499" dur="6.121">that Iran is making up fake news well</text>
  <text start="467.069" dur="4.831">right off the bat we know most likely</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="4.439">it&amp;#39;s true because we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="4.859">that we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="474.059" dur="4.95">seen more than enough evidence that</text>
  <text start="476.759" dur="4.321">shows that yes the United States has</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="3.84">been supporting the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="5.669">created it this was all part of their</text>
  <text start="482.849" dur="7.65">plan and the coalition forces they were</text>
  <text start="486.749" dur="4.95">all involved in this we see right now</text>
  <text start="490.499" dur="3.861">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="491.699" dur="7.59">central bankers they announced sanctions</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="10.059">against 35 diplomats for the alleged</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="8.24">election hacking and the sanctions apply</text>
  <text start="504.419" dur="6.451">to five entities and six individuals and</text>
  <text start="507.529" dur="7.75">US officials are expelling the</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="7.26">thirty-five Russian diplomats now Obama</text>
  <text start="515.279" dur="5.13">using the executive order he took</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="5.159">additional steps to address the national</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="5.61">emergency with respect to significant</text>
  <text start="523.289" dur="4.621">malicious cyber-enabled activities this</text>
  <text start="526.019" dur="4.32">immense executive order one three six</text>
  <text start="527.91" dur="5.25">nine for blocking the property of</text>
  <text start="530.339" dur="6.98">certain persons engaging in significant</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="8.81">malicious cyber-enabled activities and</text>
  <text start="537.319" dur="8.26">they did all this without any evidence</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="6.099">that was provided to Congress that was</text>
  <text start="545.579" dur="6">provided to the electors that was</text>
  <text start="548.069" dur="6.45">provided to the American people they</text>
  <text start="551.579" dur="7.681">went on saying listen just believe us</text>
  <text start="554.519" dur="7.68">the evidence is classified and we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="4.92">handle we can&amp;#39;t hand that out well we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="562.199" dur="5.401">look at the evidence and maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="5.82">produce it later on which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="7.08">ridiculous they should provide the</text>
  <text start="570" dur="5.94">evidence first and then take action but</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s not the way the US government</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="6.09">central bankers work because they deal</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="6.57">in propaganda they deal in lies and</text>
  <text start="582.03" dur="5.16">the u.s. is saying yes we plan to</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="5.63">release the evidence once we create it</text>
  <text start="587.19" dur="5.19">because we can&amp;#39;t find anything and</text>
  <text start="590.24" dur="4.21">that&amp;#39;s why they never produced it to</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="5.64">Congress when Congress specifically</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="4.23">asked can we have the evidence and they</text>
  <text start="598.02" dur="5.01">never did</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="8.46">so right now Obama is last couple of</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="6.24">weeks in office he is pushing as hard as</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="5.16">he possibly can to get Russia to do</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="4.71">something and Russia&amp;#39;s responses you</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="6.33">know we&amp;#39;re tired of these lies about</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="6.15">Russian hackers this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="3.72">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="5.04">because they were caught hacking into</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="6.45">the election systems in Georgia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.17" dur="6.27">trying to cover their tracks they have</text>
  <text start="628.8" dur="5.4">no evidence whatsoever that links the</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="6.15">Russian government to any of this and if</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="5.46">they truly had evidence they would have</text>
  <text start="637.59" dur="5.01">been all over the corporate media in a</text>
  <text start="639.66" dur="6.17">split second they wouldn&amp;#39;t wait for it</text>
  <text start="642.6" dur="6.27">they would produce it very quickly</text>
  <text start="645.83" dur="6.46">because they like to show what they have</text>
  <text start="648.87" dur="7.13">and when they have nothing they use a</text>
  <text start="652.29" dur="7.74">lot of propaganda so what happens now</text>
  <text start="656" dur="9.96">well we see they&amp;#39;ve taken the first step</text>
  <text start="660.03" dur="9.26">by using fake news lies the next step is</text>
  <text start="665.96" dur="6.37">most likely some type of cyber response</text>
  <text start="669.29" dur="5.2">because we could see right now they want</text>
  <text start="672.33" dur="6.06">a war started before Trump even gets</text>
  <text start="674.49" dur="6.33">into office because once Trump gets into</text>
  <text start="678.39" dur="4.89">office you know this whole deal with</text>
  <text start="680.82" dur="5.79">Russia most likely is going to disappear</text>
  <text start="683.28" dur="6.87">and they don&amp;#39;t want it to disappear they</text>
  <text start="686.61" dur="5.729">want something to occur right now but we</text>
  <text start="690.15" dur="5.25">can see right now that Putin he is not</text>
  <text start="692.339" dur="5.611">going for it he&amp;#39;s not falling for their</text>
  <text start="695.4" dur="4.59">tricks he knows it&amp;#39;s a lie he knows they</text>
  <text start="697.95" dur="7.53">have nothing or they would have produced</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="7.02">it already so the question is what is</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="3.03">the US government central bankers the</text>
  <text start="707.01" dur="4.29">elite what are they going to do at this</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="5.9">point because this is going to do</text>
  <text start="711.3" dur="5.53">nothing it&amp;#39;s what they do afterward</text>
  <text start="714.41" dur="6.21">is what they&amp;#39;re going to try to push and</text>
  <text start="716.83" dur="6.94">we most likely will see some type of</text>
  <text start="720.62" dur="5.07">cyber event or some other type of event</text>
  <text start="723.77" dur="4.41">which they are most likely preparing</text>
  <text start="725.69" dur="6.6">right now to push this to the next level</text>
  <text start="728.18" dur="6.39">and will this happen during New Year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.29" dur="4.86">will it happen the first couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="4.92">in January well we&amp;#39;ll need to watch</text>
  <text start="737.15" dur="4.53">because we can see this is quickly</text>
  <text start="739.49" dur="5.1">approaching they might even do it in the</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="5.28">first week of Trump to try to push him</text>
  <text start="744.59" dur="6.06">into doing something at that point make</text>
  <text start="746.96" dur="7.11">this event so incredible that Trump has</text>
