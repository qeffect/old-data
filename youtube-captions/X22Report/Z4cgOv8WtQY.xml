  <text start="138.28" dur="5.16">seeing right now is that a lot of things</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="4.981">are starting to happen Representative</text>
  <text start="143.44" dur="4.53">Devin Nunez chair of the House</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="4.859">Intelligence Committee is expanding his</text>
  <text start="147.97" dur="5.28">committees investigation into the FBI</text>
  <text start="150.549" dur="5.011">and the Department of Justice in the</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="3.66">handling of the ongoing probe into the</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="4.29">alleged collusion between the Trump</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="6.21">campaign and Russia now according to the</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="6.06">letter Rosenstein has finally agreed to</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="5.13">comply with a subpoena issued by the</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="5.45">house intelligence community last August</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="5.63">to produce fully unredacted records of</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="4.75">conversations that could shed light on</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="6.43">accusations the FBI pursued the</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="9.599">investigation in a unfair manner which</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="9.209">most likely they did we also see that</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="5.971">Nunez is going to be interviewing many</text>
  <text start="189.519" dur="4.741">different individuals they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="5.779">be interviewing Attorney General Deputy</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="6.11">Attorney General Bruce or FBI</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="5.831">Supervisory Special Agent Peter stroke</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="6.91">former FBI general counsel James Baker</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="7.289">we&amp;#39;re gonna see Sally Moyer Greg Brower</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="4.799">and many many others where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="5.431">to be bringing them in and talking to</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="7.49">them also the remaining approximately</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="5.64">9,500 text messages between the FBI</text>
  <text start="219.569" dur="4.931">Supervisory Special Agent Peter stroke</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="5.94">and his mistress FBI attorney Lisa page</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="5.7">is looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna be asking</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="5.25">for all of this and they&amp;#39;re gonna comb</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="6.629">through that and see what is really in</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="7.14">there we also see the memos that Comey</text>
  <text start="236.829" dur="5.52">gave to Daniel Richmond which then gave</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="4.17">to New York Times we&amp;#39;re starting to find</text>
  <text start="242.349" dur="4.5">out they&amp;#39;re not just one of those memos</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="6.72">was classified but all of them were</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="7.47">classified how do we know this well it</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="6.539">looks like Judicial Watch director of</text>
  <text start="254.319" dur="5.91">Investigations Chris Farrell who has a</text>
  <text start="257.409" dur="5.94">signed declaration from FBI&amp;#39;s chief</text>
  <text start="260.229" dur="7.291">Freedom of Information Act officer say</text>
  <text start="263.349" dur="8.371">stating that yes all the memos Comey had</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="8.25">were all classified at the time they</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="6.66">were written and they remain classified</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="4.56">therefore Farrell points out that Comey</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="4.2">mishandled national defense information</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.05">when he knowingly and willingly leaked</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="4.589">them to his friend at Columbia</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.56">University now Daniel Richmond is going</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="5.31">to be in trouble too because he accepted</text>
  <text start="288.94" dur="7.17">classified information and we see right</text>
  <text start="292.479" dur="6.72">now that Comey not only authored those</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="6.929">documents but then knowingly leaked them</text>
  <text start="299.199" dur="6.631">and again he should have been read his</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="6.6">rights during the Senate hearing</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="6.39">remember Daniel Richmond refused to hand</text>
  <text start="309.639" dur="3.84">over the memos to the Senate when they</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="2.79">were asked remember during the Senate</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="3">when they said hey can we get these</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="3.269">memos do you have them and of course</text>
  <text start="316.479" dur="3.151">Comey arrived there with no memos</text>
  <text start="318.279" dur="3.271">whatsoever he said his friend</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="3.81">had the memos nobody else had them</text>
  <text start="321.55" dur="3.6">anywhere he didn&amp;#39;t give him copies it</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="2.96">makes no sense and then they asked</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="3.06">Daniel Richmond to hand him over and he</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="5.2">refused to do so</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="5.79">this tells you something is going on</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="4.71">here and they&amp;#39;re cracking down on all of</text>
  <text start="334" dur="5.01">it and we might see justice this year</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="4.41">because as they dig deeper more</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="4.86">informations going to come out it looks</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="7.74">like mana fort is going to be suing the</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="7.44">Mueller investigation and he&amp;#39;s filing a</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="4.73">civil lawsuit against Robert Mueller rod</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="4.89">Rosenstein and the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.81">the lawsuit promises to shut down the</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="5.21">baseless and phony Emilia investigation</text>
  <text start="358" dur="6.66">and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="7.21">investigation is completely outside of</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="6.27">his scope as Special Counsel which it is</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="4.44">he was looking at Russian collusion and</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="3.51">he didn&amp;#39;t find anything and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="1.95">just going off in all different</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="3.6">directions</text>
  <text start="375.01" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s also in there cleaning up all the</text>
  <text start="378.04" dur="2.82">different records so nobody can find</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="3.33">things out and I think he&amp;#39;s having a</text>
  <text start="380.86" dur="3.54">very tough time doing this because a lot</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="4.26">of these records have been taken already</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="4.83">and he can&amp;#39;t find anything so he&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="387.28" dur="3.81">know out there trying to do whatever he</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="5.49">possibly can now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="7.59">is that a federal judge struck down a</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="6">request by fusion fusion GPS to block</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="3.78">the house intelligent committee from</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="4.29">obtaining complete bank records in</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="4.83">relation to their activities during 2016</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="4.83">remember they ordered they they wanted</text>
  <text start="407.29" dur="6.69">the bank records fusion GPS is under the</text>
  <text start="409.84" dur="5.94">spotlight right now and fusion sought to</text>
  <text start="413.98" dur="5.34">invalidate a subpoena issued by</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="6.24">committee chairman Devin Nunez at which</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="4.2">they tried to claim was issued illegally</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="4.08">as well as a violation of the First</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="5.55">Amendment and US District Court Judge</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="5.4">Richard Leon struck down all four of</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="4.79">fusions requests in his order now if we</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="6.51">look at this we can see what they did</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="7.27">Judge Lyon addressed each aspect of</text>
  <text start="438.01" dur="6.09">fusions request and why he disagreed</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="5.94">which is why it takes judges forever to</text>
  <text start="444.1" dur="5.37">write these things now fusion asserted</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="4.44">that Nunez went rogue and issued the</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="3.64">subpoena by himself pursuant to no</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="4.78">resolution by the committee</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="5.31">and he recused himself when he had rep</text>
  <text start="456.29" dur="2.97">Mike Conway temporarily take charge of</text>
  <text start="458.42" dur="2.73">the investigation</text>
  <text start="459.26" dur="4.56">therefore Nunez had no authority to</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="7.94">request fusion GPS bank records judge</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="8.46">said well yeah that doesn&amp;#39;t hold water</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="5.71">no we&amp;#39;re in his press release did</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="4.83">chairman Nunez recuse himself from the</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="4.68">Russian investigation instead he simply</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="4.11">designated another committee member to</text>
  <text start="479.48" dur="4.5">take charge of the investigation as</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="5.79">permitted by the committee rules number</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="4.89">two fusion then requested that the judge</text>
  <text start="487.01" dur="6.33">narrow the scope of the release to</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="7.26">exclude ten law firms fusion also</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="4.08">alleges that transactions with certain</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="4.05">media companies journalists and</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="5.16">businesses are not pertinent well the</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="4.41">judge responded to that telling fusion</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="5.52">that the mere fact that the two law</text>
  <text start="504.59" dur="5.94">firms paid you paid fusion gb/s for work</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="3.87">related to Trump provides a reasonable</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="3.84">basis to believe that fusions</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="5.07">transactions with other law firms during</text>
  <text start="514.37" dur="5.52">the same time frame may reveal similar</text>
  <text start="517.04" dur="4.53">relevant information adding the</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="4.14">committee also has an intelligent</text>
  <text start="521.57" dur="4.98">suggestion that fusion directed steel to</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="5.04">meet with at least five major media</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="3.09">outlets to discuss his work on the Trump</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="3.09">dossier</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="4.44">it is thus reasonable for the committee</text>
  <text start="532.16" dur="3.99">to pursue records containing fusions</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="4.05">transactions with various media</text>
  <text start="536.15" dur="4.08">companies and journalists to determine</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="4.71">whether they two had involvement with</text>
  <text start="540.23" dur="6.3">the Trump dossier or with Russia Russian</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="5.79">active measures number three fusion</text>
  <text start="546.53" dur="3.81">tried to suggest that if their bank</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="3.45">hands over the records it would infringe</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="3.9">on fusions First Amendment rights to</text>
  <text start="552.08" dur="4.11">engage in free political speech free</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="4.53">political activity and free association</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="4.71">and it would reveal the identity of its</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="5.04">clients and this would hinder them from</text>
  <text start="560.9" dur="4.77">contracting anonymously with fusion in</text>
  <text start="563.81" dur="4.08">the future now the judge responded to</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="4.56">that unfortunately for the plaintiff I</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="3.96">cannot agree on a basis that fusions</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="3.72">commercial relationship with its clients</text>
  <text start="571.85" dur="4.26">does not provide fusion with some</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="4.62">special First Amendment Amendment</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="5.28">protection from subpoenas since it would</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="4.86">allow any entity that provides goods and</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="4.56">services to a customer who engages in</text>
  <text start="583.43" dur="3.39">political activity to resist a subpoena</text>
  <text start="585.95" dur="3.5">on the</text>
  <text start="586.82" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s clients engages in political speech</text>
  <text start="589.45" dur="4.72">lastly fusion trying to argue that</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="4.92">turning bank records over to Congress</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="5.73">would violate 12 US Code section 3401</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="4.83">right to a financial privacy statute</text>
  <text start="599.9" dur="3.69">which prohibits banks from releasing</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="3.42">customer records to a government</text>
  <text start="603.59" dur="4.35">authority along with non-affiliated</text>
  <text start="605.51" dur="4.86">third party personal information the</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="5.37">judge responded to that ultimately I</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="4.13">find both of the plaintiffs arguments to</text>
  <text start="613.31" dur="3.99">be without merit</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="6.79">first because fusion has no rights under</text>
  <text start="617.3" dur="6.21">the r.fp a because it&amp;#39;s not a person who</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="3.45">may qualify as a customer for the</text>
  <text start="623.51" dur="3.21">purpose of that statute</text>
  <text start="624.74" dur="3.44">adding unfortunately for the plaintiff</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="5.16">the text of the statute equally</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="6.16">forecloses fusions claim of rights under</text>
  <text start="631.88" dur="6.24">the non-affiliated third party statute</text>
  <text start="634.34" dur="6.6">in conclusion the judge rules that Nunez</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="4.41">subpoena was issued pursuant to a</text>
  <text start="640.94" dur="3.99">constitutionally authorized</text>
  <text start="642.53" dur="3.96">investigation by a committee of the US</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="3.15">House of Representative with</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="4.11">jurisdiction over intelligence and</text>
  <text start="648.08" dur="4.8">intelligence-related activities designed</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="5.25">to protect us from potential</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="5.34">cyberattacks now and in the future thus</text>
  <text start="655.85" dur="4.23">because I find all of fusions objections</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="4.89">to be this to the subpoena to be</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="5.31">unveiling fusion cannot satisfy the</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="5.79">first factor of its burden for obtaining</text>
  <text start="665.39" dur="6.96">a preliminary injunction a likelihood of</text>
  <text start="668.9" dur="4.2">success on the merits and I need go no</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="3.42">further</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="6.48">he said the plaintiffs motion that must</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="5.94">therefore be denied and we can see that</text>
  <text start="679.58" dur="3.96">now these bank records are going to be</text>
  <text start="681.71" dur="4.44">released they&amp;#39;re gonna comb through them</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="6.3">and they&amp;#39;re gonna find out who actually</text>
  <text start="686.15" dur="7.35">was involved on this the walls are</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="6.36">closing in around the cabal around the</text>

  <text start="710" dur="4.11">cover up what is going on they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="712.13" dur="4.35">going to report on this we might even</text>
  <text start="714.11" dur="4.38">see the event of all events happen out</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="3.15">in the Middle East or here in the United</text>
  <text start="718.49" dur="1.65">States I would think in the United</text>
  <text start="719.63" dur="2.28">States</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="5.13">to really cover all this up because</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="6.36">these individuals they&amp;#39;re not going down</text>
  <text start="725.27" dur="6.36">with the ship they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever</text>
  <text start="728.27" dur="5.73">it takes to cover all this up because</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="4.26">once they start digging in a little bit</text>
  <text start="734" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna find out so much</text>
  <text start="735.89" dur="3.66">information it&amp;#39;s gonna make people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="737.78" dur="4.32">head spins and people are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="739.55" dur="4.5">realize what this country what these</text>
  <text start="742.1" dur="5.01">people were doing in this country all</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="5.73">along that they&amp;#39;ve been lied to that</text>
  <text start="747.11" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve been scammed and the whole</text>
  <text start="749.78" dur="5.97">system is corrupt and people are going</text>
  <text start="753.59" dur="3.24">to pop remember when you started to</text>
  <text start="755.75" dur="2.61">learn the truth</text>
  <text start="756.83" dur="4.29">remember when you started to hear all</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="5.16">this how angry you got how pissed off</text>
  <text start="761.12" dur="4.11">you were well this is gonna happen to a</text>
  <text start="763.52" dur="4.17">lot of people they&amp;#39;re not gonna want to</text>
  <text start="765.23" dur="4.59">believe because that&amp;#39;s the first thing I</text>
  <text start="767.69" dur="5">don&amp;#39;t believe it you&amp;#39;re lying to me it</text>
  <text start="769.82" dur="5.75">makes no sense this can&amp;#39;t be true</text>
  <text start="772.69" dur="5.23">but this is why this has been you know</text>
  <text start="775.57" dur="4.09">ongoing for a while this is why</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="3.87">information has been spilled out a</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="3.87">little bit at a time to get people used</text>
  <text start="781.79" dur="4.41">to this but the corporate media once</text>
  <text start="783.53" dur="4.41">again they&amp;#39;re holding back on reporting</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="3.57">any of this yes they show a little bit</text>
  <text start="787.94" dur="3.66">of it but they&amp;#39;re really not going to</text>
  <text start="789.77" dur="3.78">report on it especially when they start</text>
  <text start="791.6" dur="4.08">to dig deeper when information starts to</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="5.28">come out what they most likely will do</text>
  <text start="795.68" dur="4.89">is they&amp;#39;ll turn it around they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="798.83" dur="3.81">other words in there they&amp;#39;ll make it</text>
  <text start="800.57" dur="4.08">seem like it&amp;#39;s not that bad that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.64" dur="4.89">really crazy and then they&amp;#39;ll move over</text>
  <text start="804.65" dur="4.44">to move on to a different distraction to</text>
  <text start="807.53" dur="3.66">pretend that that story didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="809.09" dur="3.72">happen in they&amp;#39;ll bury it and hopefully</text>
  <text start="811.19" dur="3.45">nobody sees it that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="812.81" dur="4.05">eventually that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="814.64" dur="4.89">eventually end up doing they do this</text>
  <text start="816.86" dur="5.85">every single time now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="819.53" dur="7.35">interesting is that we had this story</text>
  <text start="822.71" dur="6.99">come out about Intel and it looks like</text>
  <text start="826.88" dur="5.34">individuals were hacking into their own</text>
  <text start="829.7" dur="3.26">computers and they found something very</text>
  <text start="832.22" dur="4.11">interesting</text>
  <text start="832.96" dur="6.28">Daniel gross he hacked into his own</text>
  <text start="836.33" dur="4.5">computer and exposed a flaw in most of</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="5.22">the chips made in the past two decades</text>
  <text start="840.83" dur="5.25">by hardware giant Intel he&amp;#39;s 31 year old</text>
  <text start="844.46" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s an information security researcher</text>
  <text start="846.08" dur="5.76">and postdoctoral fellow at Austria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="4.56">Graz Technical University and he</text>
  <text start="851.84" dur="5.04">breached the inner sanctum of his can</text>
  <text start="853.85" dur="6.9">computer CPU and stolen secrets from it</text>
  <text start="856.88" dur="5.34">and until that moment grosse and his</text>
  <text start="860.75" dur="3.87">colleagues Moritz</text>
  <text start="862.22" dur="4.77">lip and Michael Schwartz had thought</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="4.199">such an attack on the processors kernel</text>
  <text start="866.99" dur="4.56">memory which is meant to be inaccessible</text>
  <text start="868.819" dur="7.411">to users was only theoretically possible</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="7.649">and he saw something very interesting he</text>
  <text start="876.23" dur="6.45">saw his private website addresses from</text>
  <text start="879.199" dur="5.82">Firefox being dumped by the tool I wrote</text>
  <text start="882.68" dur="5.3">and I was really and he said I was</text>
  <text start="885.019" dur="9.451">really shocked about this he said the</text>
  <text start="887.98" dur="10.63">processor was stealing information from</text>
  <text start="894.47" dur="5.97">his desktop and one of them is called</text>
  <text start="898.61" dur="3.529">meltdown this is what he&amp;#39;s calling it</text>
  <text start="900.44" dur="5.129">and the other one is called specter and</text>
  <text start="902.139" dur="7.32">what he&amp;#39;s saying is that his passwords</text>
  <text start="905.569" dur="6.811">his photos anything that he had on there</text>
  <text start="909.459" dur="5.291">guess what it was going through the</text>
  <text start="912.38" dur="7.199">processor now we need to remember that</text>
  <text start="914.75" dur="6.959">the CIA they had code written into all</text>
  <text start="919.579" dur="5.101">of these chips remember it was chip</text>
  <text start="921.709" dur="5.61">based and we know the phones have it the</text>
  <text start="924.68" dur="6.24">computers have it and what I think was</text>
  <text start="927.319" dur="5.82">just found was the intelligent agency&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.92" dur="4.14">code where they were stealing</text>
  <text start="933.139" dur="5.25">information where they had access to</text>
  <text start="935.06" dur="6.48">anyone&amp;#39;s system and I think this was now</text>
  <text start="938.389" dur="6.271">exposed all that talk about you know</text>
  <text start="941.54" dur="5.46">spying and the CIA the NSA you know</text>
  <text start="944.66" dur="4.349">looking into our computers into our</text>
  <text start="947" dur="2.88">phones I think this was just revealed</text>
  <text start="949.009" dur="2.461">now they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like</text>
  <text start="949.88" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it seem like oh no</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="3.719">this was just a floor we were covering</text>
  <text start="952.91" dur="4.26">it up I think Intel knew about it I</text>
  <text start="955.189" dur="4.08">think they worked with the intelligent</text>
  <text start="957.17" dur="4.019">agency and now I think this information</text>
  <text start="959.269" dur="5.19">is coming out now and they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="961.189" dur="6.121">what to do with it we see out in Nigeria</text>
  <text start="964.459" dur="5.37">it looks like a hundred seven hundred</text>
  <text start="967.31" dur="6.42">civilians including women and children</text>
  <text start="969.829" dur="5.911">escaped from Lake Chad and it looks like</text>
  <text start="973.73" dur="4.56">they were there at this some type of</text>
  <text start="975.74" dur="4.56">work camp where Boko Haram was keeping</text>
  <text start="978.29" dur="3.989">them in making them work in this area</text>
  <text start="980.3" dur="3.96">and they escaped and remember the</text>
  <text start="982.279" dur="4.62">Nigerian president came out and said</text>
  <text start="984.26" dur="3.269">listen we&amp;#39;re beating Boko Haram they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.899" dur="2.19">defeated</text>
  <text start="987.529" dur="3.841">and it&amp;#39;s starting to look like this is</text>
  <text start="989.089" dur="4.17">absolutely true and if you notice all</text>
  <text start="991.37" dur="4.11">these different groups are part of the</text>
  <text start="993.259" dur="5.041">same system the paid mercenaries the</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="3.959">Islamic state al Qaeda al sham Boca Aram</text>
  <text start="998.3" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re all part of the same system</text>
  <text start="999.439" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re all part of the cabal&amp;#39;s paid</text>
  <text start="1002.23" dur="4.95">mercenary army and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="1004.779" dur="4.53">intelligence community and we can see</text>
  <text start="1007.18" dur="4.409">that they&amp;#39;re being defeated in each one</text>
  <text start="1009.309" dur="3.69">of these areas we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1011.589" dur="3.87">North Korea and South Korea they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1012.999" dur="5.371">decided to speak to each other which</text>
  <text start="1015.459" dur="4.56">kind of throws out the United States</text>
  <text start="1018.37" dur="4.56">because South Korea and North Korea</text>
  <text start="1020.019" dur="5.28">decided to have these talks without the</text>
  <text start="1022.93" dur="5.879">United States being the arbiters of the</text>
  <text start="1025.299" dur="8.701">talks and this tells us that things are</text>
  <text start="1028.809" dur="6.841">now progressing the way China Russia yes</text>
  <text start="1034" dur="3.659">the u.s. I&amp;#39;m not talking about the Cabal</text>
  <text start="1035.65" dur="3.509">I&amp;#39;m talking about the US this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1037.659" dur="4.02">what they wanted now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1039.159" dur="4.951">interesting is that Russia and this</text>
  <text start="1041.679" dur="5.64">seems like this is the signal to bring</text>
  <text start="1044.11" dur="4.88">in the administration to work with North</text>
  <text start="1047.319" dur="4.051">Korea remember Tillerson was out there</text>
  <text start="1048.99" dur="5.59">saying that we should speak to North</text>
  <text start="1051.37" dur="6.059">Korea this was the beginning stages to</text>
  <text start="1054.58" dur="5.28">get people used to this and now we have</text>
  <text start="1057.429" dur="9.511">South Korea speaking to North Korea and</text>
  <text start="1059.86" dur="11.34">we have the drills stopped for the</text>
  <text start="1066.94" dur="7.08">Olympic period of time all of this is</text>
  <text start="1071.2" dur="5.79">happening for a reason because Russia</text>
  <text start="1074.02" dur="5.519">right now is saying hey listen since</text>
  <text start="1076.99" dur="4.5">North and the South are ready to speak</text>
  <text start="1079.539" dur="7.171">to each other this might be a really</text>
  <text start="1081.49" dur="7.679">great time for the u.s. to join China</text>
  <text start="1086.71" dur="6.42">and Russia North Korea and South Korea</text>
  <text start="1089.169" dur="8.75">in the talks so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1093.13" dur="9.21">inviting the u.s. into this position of</text>
  <text start="1097.919" dur="6.281">being included in the talks and we can</text>
  <text start="1102.34" dur="5.579">see how this is all being played out</text>
  <text start="1104.2" dur="7.02">right now we&amp;#39;re the first part of peace</text>
  <text start="1107.919" dur="5.551">is happening and this is because Kim</text>
  <text start="1111.22" dur="4.38">Jong moon is comfortable with his</text>
  <text start="1113.47" dur="3.39">nuclear program and his missile program</text>
  <text start="1115.6" dur="2.549">even though it&amp;#39;s not the best and his</text>
  <text start="1116.86" dur="3.92">missiles breakup and things like that</text>
  <text start="1118.149" dur="4.851">and his nuclear weapons are not that</text>
  <text start="1120.78" dur="5.64">powerful he can still you know push</text>
  <text start="1123" dur="5.76">damage in certain different areas and we</text>
  <text start="1126.42" dur="3.54">can see right now the Cabal is not going</text>
  <text start="1128.76" dur="4.08">to like this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1129.96" dur="5.07">and most likely they might try something</text>
  <text start="1132.84" dur="5.01">this is what we&amp;#39;re watching right now we</text>
  <text start="1135.03" dur="4.68">see that nikki Haley the u.s. is out</text>
  <text start="1137.85" dur="4.02">there and they&amp;#39;re calling for this UN</text>
  <text start="1139.71" dur="5.13">emergency meeting that we need to stop a</text>
  <text start="1141.87" dur="4.92">ram and Russia and China</text>
  <text start="1144.84" dur="4.32">you know slap them down and said no this</text>
  <text start="1146.79" dur="4.95">is an internal problem the US should not</text>
  <text start="1149.16" dur="4.44">interfere whatsoever and I think this is</text>
  <text start="1151.74" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s going to happen but what we do</text>
  <text start="1153.6" dur="7.2">see which is very interesting the</text>
  <text start="1156.03" dur="7.98">Iranians they are now marching and they</text>
  <text start="1160.8" dur="6.63">are condemning those individuals that</text>
  <text start="1164.01" dur="6.48">have been rioting and the protests</text>
  <text start="1167.43" dur="7.08">against the rioters are larger than</text>
  <text start="1170.49" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;ve ever seen before and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.51" dur="5.7">happening in all different cities where</text>
  <text start="1177.21" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re saying that these riots these</text>
  <text start="1180.21" dur="6.12">acts of vandalism in the country are not</text>
  <text start="1183.72" dur="7.38">appropriate that these people should be</text>
  <text start="1186.33" dur="8.67">arrested and thrown in jail and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1191.1" dur="7.62">huge rallies where they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="1195" dur="8.19">idea and this tells us that the plan</text>
  <text start="1198.72" dur="7.83">that the Cabal had did not work and this</text>
  <text start="1203.19" dur="6.12">tells us that the Cabal again is backed</text>
  <text start="1206.55" dur="5.34">into a corner North Korea is not going</text>
  <text start="1209.31" dur="4.68">the way they want they can&amp;#39;t get the UN</text>
  <text start="1211.89" dur="5.37">to do anything to interfere in Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1213.99" dur="5.07">internal problems Ukraine nothing really</text>
  <text start="1217.26" dur="4.14">happening there as of yet something</text>
  <text start="1219.06" dur="3.81">might happen Syria that looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1221.4" dur="4.5">a lost cause unless something happens</text>
  <text start="1222.87" dur="5.43">which tells us that the Cabal is getting</text>
  <text start="1225.9" dur="6.45">ready to do something huge look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1228.3" dur="5.64">happening with fusion GPS I mean can you</text>
  <text start="1232.35" dur="3.63">imagine when the bank records get handed</text>
  <text start="1233.94" dur="4.38">over and they start combing through them</text>
  <text start="1235.98" dur="4.62">and start naming names and finding out</text>
