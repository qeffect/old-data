  <text start="75.95" dur="6.18">after another completely collapse on</text>
  <text start="78.979" dur="5.341">itself and it&amp;#39;s not slowing up and we</text>
  <text start="82.13" dur="4.17">see that as we move throughout this year</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse and this</text>
  <text start="86.3" dur="4.2">holiday season it&amp;#39;s not going to get any</text>
  <text start="88.46" dur="4.29">better we&amp;#39;re going to see most likely</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="4.8">after this holiday season a lot more</text>
  <text start="92.75" dur="5.34">stores closed down which means there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="107.57" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re going to be letting go around</text>
  <text start="109.009" dur="5.31">3,000 people and we can see already that</text>
  <text start="112.34" dur="4.74">these individuals going to have a very</text>
  <text start="114.319" dur="5.461">difficult time trying to find work now</text>
  <text start="117.08" dur="5.34">we can see at this point that Sears most</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="6.03">likely will cease to exist as we move</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="5.159">throughout these coming months and a lot</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="4.05">of other stores which we&amp;#39;ve known for a</text>
  <text start="127.579" dur="5.461">very long time they don&amp;#39;t exist anymore</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="5.629">now we realize that the economy is</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="5.07">breaking down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="135.489" dur="5.351">everywhere we look we see things</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="5.31">accelerating to the downside and we were</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="5.01">looking at home Capital Group this is up</text>
  <text start="143.42" dur="4.289">in Canada where they were having major</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="6.389">major problems where they had the liar</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="6.241">loans they were basically imploding on</text>
  <text start="152.239" dur="3.691">themselves and depositors were taking</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="5.25">their funds out of the financial</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="6.75">institution and many people thought okay</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="4.95">this is going to be the first sign it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.17">going to have a domino effect it will</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="4.86">start affecting other financial</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="3.87">institutions and this will be a council</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="4.89">getting effect now something very</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="7.889">interesting just happen Warren Buffett</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="8.19">he came in and he quired acquired 38.4%</text>
  <text start="178.609" dur="4.981">of home Capital Group and he&amp;#39;s providing</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="5.08">around two billion dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="7.84">loans now the question is</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="8.49">why is he doing this why did Warren</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="7.02">Buffett indirectly acquire 300 million</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="4.829">dollars of the firm shares in a private</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="4.73">placement through its Columbia Insurance</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="6.691">unit why did he do this</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="6.63">well we can see that there were many</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="7.41">many problems with home Capital Group</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="8.35">where the company was in a cross has for</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="5.67">peddling liar loans last week home</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="3.57">capital reached around thirty point five</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="3.36">million settlement with Ontario</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="3.66">Securities Commission settled a</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="3.3">class-action lawsuit and accepted</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="3.12">responsibility for misleading investors</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="4.77">about problems with his mortgage</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="6.059">underwriting procedures in April it was</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.98">accused of misleading shareholders on</text>
  <text start="234.569" dur="4.531">mortgage fraud which sent it shares</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="5.61">tumbling and once that happened it</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="6.63">sparked withdrawals and threatened to</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="6.32">disrupt Canada&amp;#39;s real estate sector so</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="7.069">Warren Buffett stepped in he decided to</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="8.229">acquire a portion of this company and</text>
  <text start="252.799" dur="7.841">the reason for this is because they knew</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="5.791">if no one did anything this would start</text>
  <text start="260.64" dur="4.26">the chain reaction and the economy</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.71">throughout Canada the u.s. the rest of</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="8.34">the world would all start coming down</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="9.899">think about 2006 2007 2008 what other</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="6.54">companies were there problems with bear</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="5.31">stearns comes to mind where they stepped</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="6.81">in and they tried to save it does this</text>
  <text start="282.539" dur="8.25">not look very familiar to that point in</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="7.98">time we&amp;#39;re seeing very similar things</text>
  <text start="290.789" dur="5.641">happen once again and the reason why</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing this is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.98">trying to hold off the entire system</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="5.069">from coming down that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.41" dur="6.21">doing this now when we look at junk</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="6.151">bonds junk bonds right now they are</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="6.57">signaling that the great global debt</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="5.58">binge well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end now the</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.65">market has gone absolutely nowhere for</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="4.83">about what 15 weeks now meanwhile</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="3.33">against the backdrop</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="5.07">you can see the credit markets are</text>
  <text start="322.17" dur="5.94">flashing major warning signs junk bonds</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="7.08">have broken their bull market trend line</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="6.69">for from the 216 bottom this is a major</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="4.17">warning that the markets are switching</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.22">into risk off mode and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="5.43">looking at right now it looks like that</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="5.46">the central bank driven credit bubble</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="6.48">from 2009 well it looks like it is now</text>
  <text start="345.48" dur="6.53">ending and we can see from everything</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="6.12">the Fed has been doing that things are</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="6.91">rapidly coming to an end here and it</text>
  <text start="355.14" dur="6.39">looks like the Fed is preparing for the</text>
  <text start="358.92" dur="4.65">next economic crisis now everything that</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at shows us that</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re in this recession right now I mean</text>
  <text start="365.67" dur="5.16">we have weak data all over the place we</text>
  <text start="368.7" dur="5.61">can see with our own two eyes how things</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.76">are rapidly deteriorating and we know</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="4.59">that the Fed is raising the interest</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="5.16">rates now they also mention that will be</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="4.59">unwinding their balance sheet now we</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="4.23">need to think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="7.08">they bought up all that toxic real</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="6.96">estate back in 2009 2010 2011 they also</text>
  <text start="390.57" dur="5.46">had stimulus to pump up the markets once</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="6.89">again and they&amp;#39;ve been holding this</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="7.47">toxic real estate while at the same time</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;ve been pumping up the real estate</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="4.32">bubbles now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="405.69" dur="5.58">second they&amp;#39;ve been pumping up the</text>
  <text start="407.82" dur="6.93">bubbles getting the prices on homes to</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="5.25">move up to make it seem like the real</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="3.06">estate market was strong now remember</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re holding all this toxic real</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="8.31">estate and the value of this continually</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="6.99">Rises which means there is going to come</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="5.61">a point where they can say let&amp;#39;s get rid</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="6.36">of it right now and here we are right</text>
  <text start="431.73" dur="5.72">now now why do they pick this time to do</text>
  <text start="434.94" dur="6.33">it well we&amp;#39;re at the top of the bubbles</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="6.13">they can unload this now people will buy</text>
  <text start="441.27" dur="6.45">it people will say yes give me this I</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="6.45">will take it now why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="4.74">they are doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="4.42">getting ready for the next round of this</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="5.77">entire market</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="7.08">collapse scenario they&amp;#39;re cleaning out</text>
  <text start="458.23" dur="5.88">as much as they possibly can so they can</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="6.3">take on more they&amp;#39;re raising interest</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="6.56">rates to basically start the chain</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="6.78">reaction we have Warren Buffett</text>
  <text start="470.67" dur="8.44">purchasing shares in this mortgage</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="8.19">company which basically was collapsing</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="8.13">now he&amp;#39;s stopping it the Fed is now</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="6.78">maneuvering to get all of this off of</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="4.53">their balance sheet now they need to do</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="5.79">this because once the system starts to</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="6.24">come down and it drops dramatically what</text>
  <text start="495.37" dur="4.32">are they going to have to do well these</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="4.17">housing prices these bubbles they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="6.9">going to pop and there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="7.53">lot more toxic real estate and they can</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="5.43">take what they have and basically go out</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="6.68">to the banks and purchase them up once</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="7.35">again they can start stimulus once again</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="5.38">to prop up the markets this is what</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about where they have</text>
  <text start="521.77" dur="4.62">been planning this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="4.65">where this is going to be a stew stage</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="4.92">type of collapse now the first stage</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="4.44">which we talked about they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="531.31" dur="3.93">let the markets go they&amp;#39;re going to let</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="4.05">the bubbles pop now remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="3.9">always said that they they can&amp;#39;t decide</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="3.93">if there&amp;#39;s a bubble or not a bubble they</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="4.23">have no tools to detect us but we know</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="3.72">for a fact they&amp;#39;re the ones who create</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="3.75">all of these bubbles they do it on</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="3.36">purpose they know exactly when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="3.81">going to pop because they do it</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="5.61">everything is completely controlled by</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="5.01">them it&amp;#39;s really not a surprise and we</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="4.2">can see that they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="555.94" dur="4.89">to bring it down this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="4.68">getting ready to do now the first stage</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="5.22">is where they&amp;#39;re going to say okay look</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s maybe being blamed on Trump let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="5.13">just use that as an example where he is</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="7.44">the one who brought down the economy now</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="7.56">not all the way part of the way and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="6.24">going to allow the Fed to step in now</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="4.56">most likely they&amp;#39;ll not raise rates any</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="2.55">more they&amp;#39;re going to say they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.49">to have to lower them back down because</text>
  <text start="584.71" dur="5.84">there&amp;#39;s no way that they can raise rates</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="5.22">when this is all happening they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="5.04">to say we&amp;#39;re going to try some stimulus</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not going to go full they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="595.59" dur="3.66">going to go full throttle with stimulus</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="4.02">right away they&amp;#39;re going to say let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.25" dur="4.56">start off slowly we&amp;#39;re going to add some</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="3.66">stimulus to the economy and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="5.07">to help the banks out right now because</text>
  <text start="605.22" dur="4.62">we can see that a lot of the real estate</text>
  <text start="608.88" dur="2.64">that they owned</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="2.55">well it&amp;#39;s dropping very quickly now</text>
  <text start="611.52" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re not going to do this right away</text>
  <text start="612.39" dur="3.93">of course they&amp;#39;re going to wait a little</text>
  <text start="614.07" dur="4.2">while until they step in and say let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.32" dur="5.42">buy up some of this toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="7.26">which again then we&amp;#39;ll create another</text>
  <text start="621.74" dur="6.25">bubble which will pump the market up</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="5.43">once again now how high can they pump</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="4.62">this market up once again well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="630.96" dur="4.02">going to have a lot of trouble because</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="6.48">this time it&amp;#39;s going to go absolutely</text>
  <text start="634.98" dur="6.57">nowhere they know this already they</text>
  <text start="639.09" dur="5.01">already know that they&amp;#39;ll have a small</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="4.17">window to do this and when I say small I</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t mean like a week I mean a couple</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="4.83">of months maybe even a year and after</text>
  <text start="648.45" dur="3.39">that point what they&amp;#39;re going to do as</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="3.63">people think that the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="4.35">better things are improving of course</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="3.15">the corporate media the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.19" dur="3.18">going to be out there telling you how</text>
  <text start="657.33" dur="4.71">great the economy is improving it is</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.25">getting better we will most likely get</text>
  <text start="662.04" dur="4.49">hit with some type of an event and this</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="5.25">will then bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="666.53" dur="6.37">permanently and we can see that the Fed</text>
  <text start="669.87" dur="5.4">right now is getting prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="672.9" dur="4.83">to do this this is what they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="675.27" dur="5.7">ready to do now like we&amp;#39;ve said in the</text>
  <text start="677.73" dur="5.13">past during this period of where the</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="4.26">economy comes down we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="682.86" dur="5.22">lot of things start to happen where</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="6.42">credit is going to start to freeze up we</text>
  <text start="688.08" dur="6.78">might see delivery start to slow in the</text>
  <text start="691.65" dur="5.07">supermarkets in stores we might start to</text>
