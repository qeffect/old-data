  <text start="54.6" dur="5.07">this he&amp;#39;s saying that the United States</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="6.96">has accelerated the demise of the dollar</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="6.42">and neuer pretty much says increased</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="4.68">legal risks from the application of us</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.2">rules to all dollar transactions around</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="4.29">the world will encourage a</text>
  <text start="70.29" dur="4.68">diversification from the dollar a</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.729">movement to diversify the currencies</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="5.49">used in international trade is</text>
  <text start="77.299" dur="4.871">inevitable trade between Europe and</text>

  <text start="82.17" dur="5.37">and maybe read and fully paid in euros</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="4.14">or renminbi we must not forget that it</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="3.3">took decades after the United States</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="3.42">became the world&amp;#39;s largest economy for</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="4.62">the dollar to replace the british pound</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="6.03">as the first international currency but</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="5.729">the phenomenon of us rules expanding to</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.01">all USD denominated transactions around</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="4.831">the world can have an accelerating</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.619">effect and we see this happening all</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="4.62">over the place we see faka we&amp;#39;re all</text>

  <text start="110.64" dur="6.42">to comply with the international IRS now</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="4.921">and this is really accelerating plus we</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="3.89">have to understand that many of the</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="5.549">countries are losing faith in the dollar</text>
  <text start="120.95" dur="4.599">they&amp;#39;re taking precautions making sure</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re hedging their bets from when the</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="4.921">dollar does collapse and we can see this</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.95">happening all across the globe at this</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="6.83">time and we have to see that Spain right</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="7.029">now is going after the people&amp;#39;s bank</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="7.909">deposits what they decided to do well</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="7.92">issue a retroactive three percent tax on</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="5.581">bank deposits pretty much they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="4.92">bailing themselves in so Spain will</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="5.22">retro actively tax bank accounts to</text>
  <text start="153.159" dur="7.291">january first 2014 stating the move will</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="6.479">boost growth and job job creation this</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="5.129">is absolutely ridiculous so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="5.521">going to take the money right now three</text>
  <text start="165.579" dur="6.211">percent of whatever you have deposit in</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="6.42">the banks and more than a more than a</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="6.96">tax this looks like a mini seizure of</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.6">deposits so it looks like they&amp;#39;re short</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="4.5">some money somebody has to balance the</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="4.349">books or something and they need to</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="4.889">collect this money so they said you know</text>
  <text start="185.379" dur="4.83">what we&amp;#39;re just going to go in and tax</text>
  <text start="188.139" dur="3.421">the money in everyone&amp;#39;s account we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="3.84">just take three percent well isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="3.959">what Cyprus did didn&amp;#39;t they say oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.049" dur="3.42">only going to take eight to ten percent</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="4.08">in the beginning and then they took</text>
  <text start="197.469" dur="3.6">forty seven percent you can call it</text>
  <text start="199.599" dur="4.5">whatever you want you can call it a tax</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="5.37">you can call it a bail-in you&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="204.099" dur="4.831">the people&amp;#39;s money and this is how it</text>
  <text start="206.439" dur="4.83">starts and this will not boost the</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="5.309">economy this will help the banks out</text>
  <text start="211.269" dur="5.101">this will not increase job growth people</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="4.17">will be losing money from their bank</text>
  <text start="216.37" dur="4.079">accounts and the next time they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="218.409" dur="5.85">okay this time we&amp;#39;re raising the taxes</text>
  <text start="220.449" dur="8.701">to ten percent then fifteen percent when</text>
  <text start="224.259" dur="7.021">does it stop plus you already pay taxes</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="4.079">on the most of the people pay taxes</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="5.19">already on the money that you put into</text>
  <text start="233.229" dur="6.78">your account and this is really not a</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="6.09">tax this is stealing the money from the</text>
  <text start="240.009" dur="5.25">accounts these are balanced and it has</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="5.129">begun so we can see already that the</text>
  <text start="245.259" dur="5.04">United States has accelerated the demise</text>
  <text start="247.689" dur="4.53">of the dollar by pushing more and more</text>
  <text start="250.299" dur="4.5">rules and regulations across the world</text>
  <text start="252.219" dur="4.681">and the rest of the countries are saying</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="4.97">you know what we just had enough of this</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="6.23">and we can see already the balance are</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="5.531">starting now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="5.409">children that are coming across the</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="5.669">border down in Texas and along the</text>
  <text start="268.539" dur="4.141">southern states is increasing right now</text>
  <text start="270.969" dur="2.851">the vast majority of 50,000</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="3.12">unaccompanied youth</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="3.66">and children have illegally crossed the</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.17">Texas border during the last few months</text>
  <text start="277.48" dur="5.01">and had been successfully delivered by</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="4.71">federal agencies to their relatives in</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.1">the United States and in New York Times</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="6.47">article reported that they revealed that</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="6.75">officials have caught an additional</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="7.12">240,000 Central American migrants since</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="6.12">April and they are being transported to</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.74">all different destinations around the</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="4.98">United States this has been planned for</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="4.59">quite a while and we can see they are</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="4.53">really pushing this agenda bringing in</text>
  <text start="307.6" dur="3.93">more and more people they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="309.97" dur="3.78">about the process they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="3.99">screaming them for health problems and</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="3.75">right now there is a notice going out to</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="4.47">the Border Patrol that they have to wear</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="5.76">masks they have to take off their</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.74">clothes as soon as they are in contact</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="3.78">with any of these children because they</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="4.41">are carrying diseases and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="4.5">no background checks and we can see this</text>
  <text start="329.14" dur="6.51">whole thing has been planned since the</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="6.81">beginning now in Afghanistan we see that</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="6.33">there were 400 NATO supplying oil</text>
  <text start="338.35" dur="5.64">tankers um pretty much attacked and</text>
  <text start="341.98" dur="4.17">blown up and now they&amp;#39;re all on fire the</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="6.9">first question is why are there four</text>
  <text start="346.15" dur="7.17">hundred NATO oil tankers all clustered</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="4.23">together that makes no sense and this</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="4.08">looks like this is a complete set up to</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="5.07">show that terrorism is running rampant</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="5.46">with in Afghanistan they&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="5.37">attacked a NATO supplying oil tankers</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="4.95">and we can see right now how NATO the</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="3.81">United States will say we need to stay</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="4.86">in Afghanistan things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="5.34">they actually attacked NATO and we can</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="4.14">see how they can play this up completely</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="4.95">now we understand the United States is</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="6.75">having a drill in the Black Sea and now</text>
  <text start="379.66" dur="7.26">Russia is having the same type of drill</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="5.61">at the same exact time hopefully nothing</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="5.01">goes wrong there where something</text>
  <text start="389.17" dur="4.65">accidentally fires off hit something</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="4.5">someone blame someone else but we see</text>
  <text start="393.82" dur="5.7">that 20 warships in over 20 planes and</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="5.28">helicopters as well as Marines and Coast</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="4.649">artillery are taking part in the Black</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="5.04">Sea Fleet exercise of course we</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="3.451">understand that the United States NATO</text>
  <text start="406.75" dur="2.97">there</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="4.32">having the sea breeze at military drills</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="4.71">which is happening at the same time both</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="4.259">sides are flexing their muscles and just</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="4.44">showing off what they have hopefully</text>
  <text start="416.199" dur="6.451">nothing happens where it breaks out into</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="7.14">a some type of skirmish now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="6.84">new law in Russia where it&amp;#39;s banning its</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="6.18">citizens where they&amp;#39;re placing their</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="4.95">personal data on foreign servers they</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="4.14">want to keep everything within Russia</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="3.39">right now all Internet companies</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="4.11">collecting personal information from</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="5.19">Russia citizens are obliged to store</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="5.43">their data inside the country according</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="5.429">to a new law the bill was proposed from</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="5.16">after some Russian MPs deemed it unwise</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="5.25">that the bulk of Russian online personal</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="4.38">data is held on foreign servers mostly</text>
  <text start="453.699" dur="3.331">the u.s. pretty much this is coming</text>
  <text start="455.41" dur="3.509">about because of the sanctions they</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="4.169">don&amp;#39;t want all the information from the</text>
  <text start="458.919" dur="5.671">Russian people all over the place on us</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="5.551">servers this way the NSA can access them</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="3.96">very easily they want to keep them all</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="3.72">contained within Russia and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="4.23">trying to pretty much pass this bill</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="4.41">right now and it goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="3.69">security of Russians personal data is</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="3.48">one of the basic rights that should be</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="3.81">protected and of course every single</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="6.48">country is very nervous because the NSA</text>
  <text start="480.28" dur="7.71">has its hand and pretty much in every</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="4.98">single piece of software in hardware and</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="3.87">they have back doors that have been</text>
  <text start="489.82" dur="3.3">opened up by these companies so the NSA</text>
  <text start="491.86" dur="4.86">is spying all over the place and</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="5.37">countries are rushing to disassociate</text>
  <text start="496.72" dur="3.479">themselves with any type of</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="4.44">american-made product because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.199" dur="5.731">afraid of being spied on now it looks</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="6.269">like NATO is going to set up a strategic</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="5.459">communication center in Latvia officials</text>
  <text start="509.199" dur="3.931">of Latvia Estonia Italy Lulu Aniyah</text>
  <text start="511.389" dur="4.2">Poland Britain and Germany have signed a</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="4.68">memorandum on setting up NATO center for</text>
  <text start="515.589" dur="4.291">strategic communications strategic</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="4.74">communications play an important role in</text>
  <text start="519.88" dur="5.31">achieving NATO&amp;#39;s political and military</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="7.5">objectives basically they are setting up</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="7.35">a propaganda type of outlet and this is</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="5.28">exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is to</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="5.52">fill and send out propaganda from this</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="5.319">area now it looks like the people of</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="5.319">slavonski lost or</text>
  <text start="540.649" dur="4.92">lost the battle in the area because</text>
  <text start="543.379" dur="4.77">right now poroshenko is ordering troops</text>

  <text start="566.66" dur="3.269">July fourth I would like to make a short</text>
  <text start="568.399" dur="3.78">statement with respect to what is</text>

  <text start="749.72" dur="5.76">our call to the commander of the Armed</text>
  <text start="751.85" dur="5.22">Forces need to eject us advisers and not</text>
  <text start="755.48" dur="3.84">to listen to their advice because they</text>

  <text start="777.4" dur="4.9">falsified it&amp;#39;s not real they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="780.32" dur="4.259">that the footage posted on the internet</text>

  <text start="784.579" dur="6.45">daddy at muscles grand mosque was</text>
  <text start="786.95" dur="6.15">indisputably not him and they say they</text>
  <text start="791.029" dur="4.5">have analyzed the footage and it is a</text>
  <text start="793.1" dur="5.64">complete fake and phony and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="7.111">interesting about this is that in July</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="6.599">4th the Syrian Armed Forces and this is</text>
  <text start="802.64" dur="5.97">a report that&amp;#39;s coming in the operation</text>
  <text start="805.339" dur="6.18">took place between 1am and five a.m.</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="4.89">the Syrian army jets flew over Rocca at</text>
  <text start="811.519" dur="4.351">a low altitude in waves repeatedly</text>
  <text start="813.5" dur="4.35">breaking the sound barrier and creating</text>
  <text start="815.87" dur="3.87">a real panic situation forcing the</text>
  <text start="817.85" dur="4.71">terrorists into underground shelters at</text>
  <text start="819.74" dur="6.599">2am the first attack occurs at Isis</text>
  <text start="822.56" dur="7.08">headquarters transport helicopters then</text>
  <text start="826.339" dur="6.331">landed the entire special units under</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="6.3">the command of several sir Syrian senior</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="5.099">officers started to move in sources that</text>
  <text start="835.94" dur="4.2">the military intelligence services knew</text>
  <text start="837.769" dur="4.921">that an important meeting of ISIL Isis</text>
  <text start="840.14" dur="5.34">commanders at highest level took place</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="5.81">in these areas the special units of the</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="5.34">SI ay approached the headquarters and</text>
  <text start="848.5" dur="5.26">covered by the roar of jets circling</text>
  <text start="850.82" dur="5.94">above they attack with surprise and</text>
  <text start="853.76" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve captured many of the high raking</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="4.62">commanders they thinking that they do</text>
  <text start="859.01" dur="4.47">have bagged a daddy also they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="861.38" dur="4.26">confirming it they&amp;#39;re not releasing the</text>
  <text start="863.48" dur="5.34">names as of yet of who they have</text>
  <text start="865.64" dur="6.449">captured at this time so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="868.82" dur="5.94">strange that this video came out during</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="5.911">this period when their raid was going on</text>
  <text start="874.76" dur="5.579">and we can see that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re using the propaganda to show</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="7.141">that bag daddy is calling for everyone</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="5.76">to join in beefing up the terrorism</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="4.53">across the world and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="890.18" dur="4.14">what the United States central bankers</text>
  <text start="892.01" dur="4.98">want to do they want to push this agenda</text>
  <text start="894.32" dur="4.44">and you have to remember the only way to</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="3.39">get into this area because again the</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="3.96">people of United States do not want more</text>
  <text start="900.38" dur="4.53">but so ever Congress has a very low</text>
  <text start="902.72" dur="4.5">approval rating they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="904.91" dur="4.169">the terrorist angle and they will bring</text>
  <text start="907.22" dur="5.609">an event here to the United States and</text>
  <text start="909.079" dur="7.021">it looks like they are doing everything</text>
  <text start="912.829" dur="5.851">they possibly can now out in the UK it</text>
  <text start="916.1" dur="5.28">looks like thousands of barclay and</text>
  <text start="918.68" dur="5.219">nationwide customers were hit by some</text>
  <text start="921.38" dur="3.959">type of IT glitch and it seems like they</text>
  <text start="923.899" dur="2.701">have quite a few of these glitches</text>
  <text start="925.339" dur="3.831">because you have to remember back in</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="5.91">December they had another one where</text>
  <text start="929.17" dur="5.409">750,000 natwest and RBS and ulster bank</text>
  <text start="932.51" dur="4.559">customers could not use their debit</text>
  <text start="934.579" dur="3.87">cards but right now thousands of</text>
  <text start="937.069" dur="3.63">frustrated bank customers found</text>
  <text start="938.449" dur="3.841">themselves unable to access them access</text>
  <text start="940.699" dur="3.481">their money yesterday at</text>
  <text start="942.29" dur="4.65">latest in a series of computer glitches</text>
  <text start="944.18" dur="5.31">the IT problem affected barclays a</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="6.54">nationwide which they together serve</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="6.959">nearly 30 million people in the UK angry</text>
  <text start="953.48" dur="4.919">consumers complain they had they</text>
  <text start="956.449" dur="3.931">couldn&amp;#39;t pay mortgage bills that can</text>
  <text start="958.399" dur="3.75">transfer funds they couldn&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="4.649">groceries they couldn&amp;#39;t take money out</text>
  <text start="962.149" dur="7.74">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="965.029" dur="6.93">see when the entire system is cyber</text>
  <text start="969.889" dur="3.63">attack and the banks are closed down</text>
  <text start="971.959" dur="4.74">look how these people are complaining</text>
  <text start="973.519" dur="5.641">about one day can you imagine this going</text>
  <text start="976.699" dur="4.89">on for a long period of time where</text>
  <text start="979.16" dur="5.4">people aren&amp;#39;t ready for what is coming</text>
  <text start="981.589" dur="5.131">now let&amp;#39;s say this was a complete cyber</text>
  <text start="984.56" dur="5.73">attack and the whole system came down in</text>
  <text start="986.72" dur="5.489">UK all of these people had no money they</text>
  <text start="990.29" dur="4.38">are not prepared the same thing here in</text>
  <text start="992.209" dur="6.3">the United States most of the population</text>
  <text start="994.67" dur="7.62">has nothing on them everything is done</text>
  <text start="998.509" dur="6.991">with plastic this is why you need to</text>
  <text start="1002.29" dur="6.419">keep gold silver cash on hand you need</text>
  <text start="1005.5" dur="7.079">to have food you need to have water this</text>
  <text start="1008.709" dur="6.201">is a perfect example now we understand</text>
  <text start="1012.579" dur="5.07">that in Mexico there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="1014.91" dur="5.14">radioactive material that&amp;#39;s being stolen</text>
  <text start="1017.649" dur="5.041">it looks like they&amp;#39;ve found the truck</text>
  <text start="1020.05" dur="5.129">the hijacked truck found in Mexico and</text>
  <text start="1022.69" dur="5.729">the container but there are still more</text>
  <text start="1025.179" dur="6">radioactive devices missing in Mexico</text>
  <text start="1028.419" dur="4.53">nobody knows where they are and again</text>
  <text start="1031.179" dur="4.73">this could be used to create a dirty</text>
  <text start="1032.949" dur="5.281">nuke here in the United States and again</text>
  <text start="1035.909" dur="3.731">we have to remember the United States</text>
  <text start="1038.23" dur="4.88">government central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="1039.64" dur="6.09">building up for this event and</text>
  <text start="1043.11" dur="4.87">information has just come out that says</text>
  <text start="1045.73" dur="6.12">that the US government now is supplying</text>
  <text start="1047.98" dur="6.72">the radical Islamist group Isis ISIL the</text>
  <text start="1051.85" dur="7.319">terrorists with software that they can</text>
  <text start="1054.7" dur="7.8">use to plan terrorist attacks and the</text>
  <text start="1059.169" dur="5.76">United States government the central</text>
  <text start="1062.5" dur="6.48">bankers the office for the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1064.929" dur="6.601">opposition is providing this terrorist</text>
  <text start="1068.98" dur="5.61">group with the software now where do you</text>
  <text start="1071.53" dur="4.59">think they got it from and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="3.09">they could use this because</text>
  <text start="1076.12" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s going to enhance their</text>
  <text start="1077.68" dur="5.85">communication systems they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="1079.51" dur="6.15">get into the net anonymously and it</text>
  <text start="1083.53" dur="5.04">seems like they are making preparations</text>
  <text start="1085.66" dur="4.77">and building this up to attack the</text>
  <text start="1088.57" dur="3.48">United States and of course we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1090.43" dur="5.01">not really the terrorists doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.05" dur="5.64">coming from inside the the United States</text>
  <text start="1095.44" dur="5.46">with the central bankers because they</text>
  <text start="1097.69" dur="4.62">need to get a war started to cover this</text>
  <text start="1100.9" dur="2.88">collapse and you can see all the pieces</text>
  <text start="1102.31" dur="3.75">now are starting to come together and</text>
  <text start="1103.78" dur="4.44">things are really starting to accelerate</text>
  <text start="1106.06" dur="4.47">as we move throughout this year because</text>
  <text start="1108.22" dur="3.93">the illusion is separating from the</text>
  <text start="1110.53" dur="4.76">reality of what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="1112.15" dur="6">economy and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1115.29" dur="5.26">things are starting to really ramp up</text>
