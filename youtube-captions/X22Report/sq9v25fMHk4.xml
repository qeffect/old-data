  <text start="156.05" dur="5.64">pump up that we saw during 2017 is</text>
  <text start="159.53" dur="4.38">starting to fade off right now we need</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="4.68">to remember that the Trump</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="6.12">administration has been using the same</text>
  <text start="166.37" dur="7.32">exact tactics as the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="6.27">Cabal remember the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="5.19">Treasury they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="5.22">manipulate the stock market they have</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="4.65">the ability to make the stock market go</text>
  <text start="181.52" dur="5.22">up make it go down they can do whatever</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="3.51">they want yes once Trump says this is</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="3.27">his</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="6.839">stock market he really is saying it is</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="6.119">his stock market he has the ability to</text>
  <text start="193.879" dur="4.86">make it go up and up and up and this is</text>
  <text start="196.129" dur="6.301">exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="198.739" dur="5.34">same tactics that the Cabal the central</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="2.009">bank have been using for a very long</text>
  <text start="204.079" dur="3.511">time</text>
  <text start="204.439" dur="6.871">but he&amp;#39;s using them on them because we</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="7.11">need to get rid of this system that is</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="5.7">dying and he knows that he understands</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="5.039">that he knows that this is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="4.89">bubble that it&amp;#39;s all fake phony and</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="4.08">everything else and to get everything</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="3.419">prepared and ready he needs to do</text>
  <text start="223.819" dur="3.57">certain things and it&amp;#39;s not just him</text>
  <text start="225.319" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s many others in the background</text>
  <text start="227.389" dur="5.16">supporting this and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="230.569" dur="4.35">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="5.37">quickly we see December housing data</text>
  <text start="234.919" dur="5.671">well it doesn&amp;#39;t look too good is sixth</text>
  <text start="237.919" dur="5.22">in existing home sales slumped by three</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.079">point six percent month a month after</text>
  <text start="243.139" dur="3.121">they surged about five point six percent</text>
  <text start="244.669" dur="4.111">in November which is kind of strange</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="5.149">with us normally the fall winter months</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="5.639">in real estate they&amp;#39;re not too good and</text>
  <text start="251.409" dur="5.38">what&amp;#39;s funny is during the summer we saw</text>
  <text start="254.419" dur="3.93">a real estate not doing well at all and</text>
  <text start="256.789" dur="3.241">then all of a sudden we enter the fall</text>
  <text start="258.349" dur="3.6">winter months all of us on real estate</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="3.54">is doing well now that&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="261.949" dur="3.331">what&amp;#39;s happening there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="4.099">manipulation in the numbers there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.919">pump up of the bubble it was a lot of</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.831">investment fund and investment houses</text>
  <text start="270.199" dur="6.871">hedge funds the banks they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="6.09">keeping the houses off the market</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re purchasing these houses with</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="5.1">very cheap money keeping them off the</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.099">market trying to drive prices up the</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="5.34">everyday person is sitting on the</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="6.351">sidelines still and they expected that</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="5.94">there was going to be 1.9 percent drop</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.72">but really what we had was a 3.6 percent</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="5.1">plunge and this is the biggest since</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="6.989">February of 2017 and they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="301.07" dur="6.589">this on that there&amp;#39;s no housing supply</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="5.821">out there now this was done on purpose</text>
  <text start="307.659" dur="4.991">where a lot of these hedge funds</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="3.27">investment companies banks they kept the</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="4.17">houses off the market because how else</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="4.98">do you draw high prices up you make it</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="3.96">seem like there&amp;#39;s not that many houses</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.26">out there and you can drive</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="4.34">prices up the less houses that are out</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="5.43">there the more people will purchase and</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="6.43">we can see right now that as the Fed</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="6.15">continually raised rates as the Fed</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="6.36">unwinds its balance sheet we see that</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="6.36">things are now taking a hit and this</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="5.03">will probably continue on remember we</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="5.76">have two things happening here</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="6.79">we have the real economy with the people</text>
  <text start="346.82" dur="6.51">where they can&amp;#39;t find jobs or they have</text>
  <text start="349.73" dur="6.5">part-time jobs where they can&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="5.61">houses we see auto loan delinquencies</text>
  <text start="356.23" dur="5.35">surging we see student loan</text>
  <text start="358.94" dur="4.85">delinquencies surging we see all these</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="4.98">different problems headed our way and</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="7">the real economy has been deteriorating</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="7.38">very very rapidly over this you know</text>
  <text start="370.79" dur="5.34">eight nine years while they had the</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="3.45">manipulation of the stock market GDP</text>
  <text start="376.13" dur="2.55">numbers unemployment numbers and</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="3.45">everything else where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="3.989">continually pushing these numbers to</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="3.06">make everyone believe that the economy</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="2.731">is doing well just like they did back in</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="3.39">2008 when they told us the subprime</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="4.23">securities were all triple-a but they</text>
  <text start="387.29" dur="3.629">were complete garbage and they told us</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="3.99">that you know all the corporations</text>
  <text start="390.919" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;re doing fine everything&amp;#39;s great it</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="4.77">looks incredible and then we find out</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="5.97">that the automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re bankrupt AIG they&amp;#39;re bankrupt</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="7.11">most of the banks are bankrupt Lehman</text>
  <text start="406.13" dur="5.19">Brothers gone Bear Stearns was in</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="6.36">trouble the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="411.32" dur="6.51">right now nothing has changed I mean</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="4.95">think about it before Trump was in</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="5.04">office and Obama was in office the</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="4.14">economy wasn&amp;#39;t growing they were</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="3.96">manipulating it the same things</text>
  <text start="424.64" dur="7.649">happening right now but for a different</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="9.839">reason because right now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="432.289" dur="7.171">to bring down this system to shut the</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="5.701">funds off from going to the Cabal to</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="6.48">shut down the central bank and we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="6.84">the middle of this process of being</text>
  <text start="445.94" dur="6.409">prepared for this transition that is</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="5.1">coming up and it&amp;#39;s sneaking up very very</text>
  <text start="452.349" dur="3.851">quickly and</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="4.86">looks like the end is getting very very</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="7.92">close I mean we are seeing all different</text>
  <text start="459.17" dur="8.46">signs that the economy is sliding now</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="6.54">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that credit</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="6.3">Swiss was out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="6.3">that the US pension funds they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="7.29">to start to sell off billions and</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="5.58">billions worth of stocks now the amount</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="4.32">that they&amp;#39;re going to be selling off is</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="4.17">about 12 billion worth of stocks and</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s going to be coming in the next</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="6.96">couple of days and credit sis credit</text>
  <text start="491" dur="5.88">Swiss calculates that funds are expected</text>
  <text start="493.67" dur="6.42">to sell a sizable 12 billion in equities</text>
  <text start="496.88" dur="7.26">and by roughly 24 billion in fixed</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="6.66">income now the amount of selling credit</text>
  <text start="504.14" dur="4.95">Swiss rights would be the biggest and at</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="6.45">least a year for a month that does not</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="5.76">coincide with the quarter end US pension</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.86">funds are also expected to be net</text>
  <text start="514.85" dur="6.42">sellers of international equities due to</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="5.1">their similarly strong performance we</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="4.26">estimate over about nine billion of</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="4.65">selling in developed market equities and</text>
  <text start="525.53" dur="6.06">three billion in selling of emerging</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="7.29">market equities and they&amp;#39;re expecting a</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="8.76">significant rotation of assets into</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="8.43">fixed income to continue now with these</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="5.79">pensions selling these stocks what is</text>
  <text start="543.53" dur="5.76">this going to mean for equities well</text>
  <text start="546.14" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out we also see that</text>
  <text start="549.29" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s one trader out there FX trader</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="7.47">Richard Breslow he says the market is</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="6.57">not priced at all for a hot trade war so</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="4.29">we have all these different things</text>
  <text start="560.72" dur="5.43">headed our way and there are warning</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="3.84">signs that the pensions they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="2.16">getting out of the stock market you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="3.63">need to fix the income because they</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.38">realize the stock market most likely has</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="5.1">hit the top and this is a really good</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="5.46">indicator to let everyone know that the</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="5.28">stock market something is about to</text>
  <text start="578.15" dur="5.13">happen we also see that the market well</text>
  <text start="581.33" dur="4.62">it hasn&amp;#39;t been priced in for the trade</text>
  <text start="583.28" dur="4.26">war with China with South Korea and this</text>
  <text start="585.95" dur="3.18">is another problem</text>
  <text start="587.54" dur="3">I mean think about all the indicators</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="2.459">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about and</text>
  <text start="590.54" dur="3.419">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been going over</text>
  <text start="591.589" dur="4.201">and how everything is coming to a head</text>
  <text start="593.959" dur="3.841">right now Peter ship was out there and</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s saying that we are near the end</text>
  <text start="597.8" dur="4.649">game and of course he&amp;#39;s pointing to</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="5.699">Trump saying he&amp;#39;s gonna be the fall guy</text>
  <text start="602.449" dur="7.291">and he said that when we look at the</text>
  <text start="606.319" dur="6.32">entire economy this is how it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.48">down so what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="612.639" dur="5.081">interest rates are going to keep rising</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="5.65">commodity prices are gonna keep rising</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="5.07">the dollars gonna keep falling so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="620.87" dur="4.769">gonna start to see pickups in the</text>

  <text start="625.639" dur="3.031">consumer prices and rising interest</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="3.63">rates are going to start to be a</text>
  <text start="628.67" dur="3.899">powerful headwind for the economy</text>
  <text start="630.92" dur="3.539">because Americans are going to be</text>
  <text start="632.569" dur="4.171">spending a lot more money on basic</text>
  <text start="634.459" dur="4.141">necessities if they have an adjustable</text>

  <text start="653.779" dur="4.11">slowing down and if they continue</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="6.63">raising rates it will go into a</text>
  <text start="657.889" dur="7.111">recession now we know that this is going</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="5.07">to be done on purpose either by Trump or</text>
  <text start="665" dur="4.589">the central bank depending on who has</text>

  <text start="825.14" dur="5.58">know that the central bank is the main</text>
  <text start="828.2" dur="5.43">problem this is why Trump has Andrew</text>
  <text start="830.72" dur="5.04">Jackson hanging on his wall because he</text>

  <text start="840.92" dur="6.08">towards this end game it&amp;#39;s almost here</text>
  <text start="844.46" dur="6.03">and we can see everything has been</text>
  <text start="847" dur="7.96">prepared for this transition China is</text>
  <text start="850.49" dur="6.87">already set up for a transition</text>
  <text start="854.96" dur="4.74">everything that&amp;#39;s here the trading</text>
  <text start="857.36" dur="4.95">systems the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="859.7" dur="5.76">all this stuff well it&amp;#39;s been duplicated</text>
  <text start="862.31" dur="5.79">out in China and we don&amp;#39;t have to wait</text>
  <text start="865.46" dur="5.43">years for the petros you wanted to gain</text>
  <text start="868.1" dur="5.64">traction and things like that no when</text>
  <text start="870.89" dur="4.71">the system comes down they say ok get</text>
  <text start="873.74" dur="3.51">rid of dollars here&amp;#39;s the petrol you</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="3.09">want that&amp;#39;s pretty much it</text>
  <text start="877.25" dur="2.97">think about it when we came onto the</text>
  <text start="878.69" dur="4.29">petrodollar nobody had the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="880.22" dur="3.09">and then everyone was like okay here we</text>

  <text start="885.62" dur="4.88">you must use the dollar to buy oil so</text>
  <text start="888.77" dur="4.29">everyone started to ramp up on dollars</text>
  <text start="890.5" dur="5.74">that&amp;#39;s really what happened the same</text>
  <text start="893.06" dur="5.64">things going to happen here now the</text>
  <text start="896.24" dur="6.599">question is is there going to be an</text>

  <text start="902.839" dur="5.101">event which I mean by war or anything</text>
  <text start="905.39" dur="4.4">else because if it&amp;#39;s with out war or</text>
  <text start="907.94" dur="4.83">anything or at any type of distraction</text>
  <text start="909.79" dur="5.89">it all can be blamed on the central bank</text>
