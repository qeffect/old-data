  <text start="38.11" dur="4.98">tember 25th 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="40.899" dur="5.071">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="43.09" dur="5.249">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="45.97" dur="5.07">economic collapse news now we are</text>
  <text start="48.339" dur="5.161">continually seeing the deterioration of</text>
  <text start="51.04" dur="6.589">the economy and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="53.5" dur="6.899">realize when we look at the entire</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="6.971">private western central bank as a whole</text>
  <text start="60.399" dur="5.851">the entire system is imploding and we</text>
  <text start="64.6" dur="4.86">can see from different countries where</text>
  <text start="66.25" dur="6.869">things are really starting to decline</text>
  <text start="69.46" dur="6.12">rapidly and we can also see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.119" dur="5.031">not the people in each of these</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="7.2">countries that are boosting the economy</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="7.06">boosting real estate retail we see that</text>
  <text start="82.78" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s coming from the outside or from the</text>
  <text start="85.21" dur="4.229">central bank and what I mean by the</text>
  <text start="87.189" dur="6.39">outside I mean foreign investors trying</text>
  <text start="89.439" dur="7.111">to park their cash and hide it and we</text>
  <text start="93.579" dur="7.111">can see right now in canada in the</text>
  <text start="96.55" dur="6.3">Vancouver area that foreign investors</text>
  <text start="100.69" dur="4.05">well they&amp;#39;re disappearing from Vancouver</text>
  <text start="102.85" dur="5.16">because the government imposed a</text>
  <text start="104.74" dur="6.11">15-percent surcharge to try to curb the</text>
  <text start="108.01" dur="8.01">the home prices from increasing and</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="7.12">surging so quickly and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="3.63">is since they&amp;#39;ve done this foreign</text>
  <text start="117.97" dur="3.66">investor said okay this is not a place</text>
  <text start="119.65" dur="4.71">for me to park my cash we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="121.63" dur="5.849">leave and we are seeing a ninety-six</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="7.439">percent plunge from about seven weeks</text>
  <text start="127.479" dur="6.09">prior so from this what are we getting</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re getting that foreign investors</text>
  <text start="133.569" dur="8.691">were responsible for sixteen point five</text>
  <text start="135.519" dur="10.351">percent of the purchases in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="6.07">driving the prices up and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="3.78">seeing right now is this is just one</text>
  <text start="148.33" dur="3.989">piece of the puzzle because the other</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="4.919">pieces are hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="5.73">companies and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="5.25">breakdown of this and when we look in</text>
  <text start="158.049" dur="3.751">the United States and not just the</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="3.981">United States but other countries we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.8" dur="4.34">starting to see that home prices</text>
  <text start="163.8" dur="5.4">starting to decline remember the</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="5.58">everyday person who got wiped out in</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="4.35">2008 never really recovered they had</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="4.05">this nice full time job they had to get</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="3.66">a part-time job we know there&amp;#39;s hundreds</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="3.48">of millions of people that are out of</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="4.2">work throughout Europe we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="3.96">hundreds and hundreds of million people</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="4.14">that don&amp;#39;t have work and many people</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="4.38">just have part-time jobs so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="4.56">really driving the real estate industry</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.7">this is why the central bank&amp;#39;s can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.91">control the entire country all they can</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="4.41">do is control different aspects of the</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="4.5">country in different cities where they</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="5.34">can say okay look San Francisco a New</text>
  <text start="200.52" dur="4.05">York loop and they can point this to</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.08">these different areas but when we go</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="5.28">outside of those controlled areas we see</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="4.65">that real estate is not doing well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="4.34">seeing more and more homes on the market</text>
  <text start="211.77" dur="4.83">for longer and longer periods of time</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re continually lowering their</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="6.15">prices and we&amp;#39;re getting into a</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="6.03">situation where this entire system it</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="5.58">will not be able to be sustained by the</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="6.68">central bank because yes they might have</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="8.46">10 15 20 cities but what about the rest</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="7.69">the rest is crashing around them and we</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="4.199">can see right now the situation it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="4.44">getting better it&amp;#39;s getting worse we</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="4.291">understand that the United States has</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="6.03">been putting putting pressure on Saudi</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="7.11">Arabia to produce more and more oil to</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="6.96">pump it out to put a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="7.49">Russia to help with the situation inside</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="6.57">the US it is remember lower oil prices</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="6.4">helps the transportation industry helps</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="6.18">production helps to move goods from</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="5.04">point A to point B lowers the costs they</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t have to lower the cost to you but</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="3.15">what they do is they it lowers the cost</text>
  <text start="273" dur="3.78">and makes them a little bit more</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="4.91">profitable or just enough to stay alive</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="5.34">they were hoping that this would help</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="4.51">with the spending where people would go</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="3.06">out and say hey look I have a lot of</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="2.779">extra money I&amp;#39;m going to go out and</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="4.14">spend the money but this didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="4.841">and we can see we&amp;#39;re getting into a</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.44">situation where there&amp;#39;s a huge problem</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="4.68">especially in Saudi Arabia because with</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="3.689">these low oil prices it is really</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.8">hurting their</text>
  <text start="297.449" dur="6.78">economy and we can see right now out in</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="8.039">Saudi Arabia that construction</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="7.171">construction workers well companies are</text>
  <text start="309.029" dur="5.97">suffering they&amp;#39;re drying up because</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="6.72">government funding is drying up and we</text>
  <text start="314.999" dur="4.651">see that Saudi Arabia needs to do</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="3.919">something completely different so</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re looking to cut production by</text>
  <text start="322.039" dur="5.53">500,000 barrels we see fellow OPEC</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="3.269">member Algeria wants the group to cut</text>
  <text start="327.569" dur="5.761">its collective output by 1 million</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="7.8">barrels a day and again is this going to</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="7.82">happen not if the United States has its</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="8.37">say because they are setting the rules</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="5.349">they are telling them what they want and</text>
  <text start="345.089" dur="3.901">we&amp;#39;ll have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="346.499" dur="4.2">because we can see right now that so far</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="3.84">every time they try to cut production it</text>
  <text start="350.699" dur="6.12">has not worked and it is another reason</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="5.16">why they are producing so much oil think</text>
  <text start="356.819" dur="3.301">about this for a second let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="4.199">nineteen seventy one when we came off</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="3.84">the gold standard when there was I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="362.189" dur="4.98">putting up air quotes here shortage of</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="6.15">oil which we know there wasn&amp;#39;t well when</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="5.191">this system dies today there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="5.489">be a problem getting oil and we can see</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="5.549">right now the glut of oil is to help</text>
  <text start="375.599" dur="3.9">this situation because they realize</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="3.361">what&amp;#39;s about to happen now is it going</text>
  <text start="379.499" dur="3.75">to help the everyday person most likely</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="5.399">not it&amp;#39;s going to help governments it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.249" dur="5.64">going to help the elite and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="7.261">another reason because when we move into</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="6.541">war they need oil they know it most</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="4.469">likely will be very difficult time to</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="6.029">get this oil so we see this huge glut of</text>
  <text start="398.399" dur="5.67">oil and this is being stored everywhere</text>
  <text start="401.459" dur="4.83">now we talk a lot about Obamacare and it</text>
  <text start="404.069" dur="4.89">is a complete disaster disaster it is in</text>
  <text start="406.289" dur="4.71">a death spiral I mean most of the</text>
  <text start="408.959" dur="4.44">original 23 coops well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="410.999" dur="5.581">completely failed and they have dumped</text>
  <text start="413.399" dur="6.24">more than 800,000 members back on to the</text>
  <text start="416.58" dur="4.23">markets over the last two years and we</text>
  <text start="419.639" dur="4.11">can see that Obamacare will likely</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="4.709">falter as the remaining coops are deep</text>
  <text start="423.749" dur="4.77">in the red I mean we&amp;#39;re looking at New</text>
  <text start="425.519" dur="5.941">Mexico health connections having</text>
  <text start="428.519" dur="6.101">problems Montana health cooperative</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="4.66">evergreen health cooperative problems</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="6.06">and there are many more they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="8.67">doing terribly so we need to think about</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="7.2">this was this planned I mean it has to</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="5.64">make you wonder was this planned all</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="4.71">along for the Affordable Care Act to</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="3.93">create maybe a you know a semi public</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="4.5">health care system that was so expensive</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="4.11">and so dysfunctional that the American</text>
  <text start="457.09" dur="6.53">people would eventually come to despise</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="9.81">it and say listen we want something else</text>
  <text start="463.62" dur="7.81">maybe a fully socialized health care</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="5.82">system was this always the plan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="4.32">starting to look like that it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="474.1" dur="4.98">to look this is exactly what they wanted</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="4.83">to do because you have to remember what</text>
  <text start="479.08" dur="3.66">our US government central bankers want</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="5.28">they want everyone dependent on the</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="8.25">government this way they can control the</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="7.11">people we see that the US government</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="5.13">central bankers they are still pushing</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="4.92">the agenda out in Charlotte we know</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="3.78">seventy percent of the people who are</text>
  <text start="497.89" dur="5.94">there protesting there from the outside</text>
  <text start="499.9" dur="6.6">they brought in agent provocateurs to</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="4.74">create chaos in the region this is</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="7.05">exactly what they want now of course the</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="7.38">police released their video their body</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="4.14">cam video footage but it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="3.719">show anything it doesn&amp;#39;t show that he</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.65">has a weapon it shows that the police</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="5.011">just opened fired on this individual we</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="4.41">also had another shooting at the</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="3.99">Washington Mall first they said it was</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="4.53">Hispanic man then all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="6.66">find out it was not we find out that</text>
  <text start="531.28" dur="6.87">this person was from Turkey and we can</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="5.39">see right now this person was caught he</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="4.86">was 20 year old he was 20 years old and</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="6.28">he went in I believe he killed four</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="7.02">women one man and when they apprehended</text>
  <text start="547" dur="6.9">him he was like in a zombie-like type of</text>
  <text start="550.03" dur="8.07">state he was unarmed the question was</text>
  <text start="553.9" dur="7.17">was he on SSRIs was there another</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="5.31">shooter what else was going on in this</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="4.019">entire situation because it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="4.529">to fit the same exact pattern</text>
  <text start="565.089" dur="5.011">and if we look at the drug aspect of it</text>
  <text start="567.939" dur="5.991">it looks like ninety-nine percent of</text>
  <text start="570.1" dur="7.169">these individuals who do these type of</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="8.319">crimes it seems like they&amp;#39;re Patsy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.269" dur="7.651">they were on medication they were set up</text>
  <text start="582.249" dur="4.89">by the FBI and then most of the time</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="4.74">they end up being shot or they kill</text>
  <text start="587.139" dur="6.14">themselves this time this person escape</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="6.239">so it might not might not have been a</text>
  <text start="593.279" dur="4.451">planned thing through the FBI maybe he</text>
  <text start="595.899" dur="6.091">was just on medication maybe it was an</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="6.75">argument with a girlfriend but we will</text>
  <text start="601.99" dur="5.039">need to wait and see but the whole point</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="5.579">of this is is that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="607.029" dur="4.62">is continually playing this up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.059" dur="2.88">continually pushing this agenda now this</text>
  <text start="611.649" dur="3.98">could be used for gun control they can</text>
  <text start="612.939" dur="5.46">use it for anything so they pick out one</text>
  <text start="615.629" dur="4">instance of something going on they blow</text>
  <text start="618.399" dur="3.841">it up they keep it on the corporate</text>
  <text start="619.629" dur="5.13">media like in Charlotte like in</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="5.519">Washington and so far what we&amp;#39;ve seen so</text>
  <text start="624.759" dur="6.87">far is bombings in new york and new</text>
  <text start="627.759" dur="8.611">jersey a race riot in charlotte being</text>
  <text start="631.629" dur="6.421">ginned up by the soros organization we</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="3.899">see another shooting in washington and</text>
  <text start="638.05" dur="6.479">we&amp;#39;re starting to see they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="640.269" dur="5.43">build this chaos scenario and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="644.529" dur="4.201">to watch it because i believe this is</text>
  <text start="645.699" dur="5.64">going to accelerate and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="648.73" dur="6.93">have more of these staged events in</text>
  <text start="651.339" dur="6.8">october we see the u.s. they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="655.66" dur="5.7">be deploying new nukes in europe and</text>
  <text start="658.139" dur="5.14">nato members are continuing to expand</text>
  <text start="661.36" dur="5.25">their anti missile capability in europe</text>
  <text start="663.279" dur="6.18">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="666.61" dur="6.149">under the so-called phased adaptive</text>
  <text start="669.459" dur="5.581">approach and the u.s. they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="672.759" dur="4.92">to place nuclear bombs with increased</text>
  <text start="675.04" dur="3.959">accuracy in europe now of course Russia</text>
  <text start="677.679" dur="2.97">is looking at this thing okay we have</text>
  <text start="678.999" dur="4.53">nuclear weapons pointing right at us at</text>
  <text start="680.649" dur="6.48">our doorstep and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="683.529" dur="7.29">all in the approach of creating the</text>
  <text start="687.129" dur="4.591">instance of a first strike in Russia yes</text>
  <text start="690.819" dur="2.25">they&amp;#39;re saying oh it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="691.72" dur="3.69">missile shield it&amp;#39;s going to protect</text>
  <text start="693.069" dur="4.841">Europe but really you can see right now</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="6.82">how they&amp;#39;re setting this up to</text>
  <text start="697.91" dur="6.15">create the first strike scenario we see</text>
  <text start="702.23" dur="3.72">US troops they&amp;#39;ve been using white</text>
  <text start="704.06" dur="5.52">phosphorus and Iraq to obscure Kurdish</text>
  <text start="705.95" dur="6.72">forces and once again we know that this</text>
  <text start="709.58" dur="5.1">is banned by the world you cannot use it</text>
  <text start="712.67" dur="4.34">on civilians but there&amp;#39;s evidence coming</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="6.27">out there that yes the United States has</text>
  <text start="717.01" dur="8.77">dropped this on civilians and this is a</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="7.17">huge concern out in Syria we see the</text>
  <text start="725.78" dur="5.97">United States they just don&amp;#39;t have two</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="7.65">bases actually they have seven bases in</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="8.31">northern Syria and they&amp;#39;ve placed them</text>
  <text start="735.77" dur="8.49">in kobane hosaka and many other regions</text>
  <text start="740.06" dur="8.16">and we can see right now that this is in</text>
  <text start="744.26" dur="6.75">preparation to create a safe zone in</text>
  <text start="748.22" dur="7.29">this area because it looks like all the</text>
  <text start="751.01" dur="6.18">bases are from Aleppo East and it looks</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="4.74">like they&amp;#39;re getting ready to create</text>
  <text start="757.19" dur="7.89">that entire safe zone and it&amp;#39;s north of</text>
  <text start="760.25" dur="7.56">Aleppo on the border of Turkey and we</text>
  <text start="765.08" dur="5.28">can see that US forces well in the</text>
  <text start="767.81" dur="4.98">northern province of Hassakeh they have</text>
  <text start="770.36" dur="6.75">their new operations room they build</text>
  <text start="772.79" dur="6.81">helipads they&amp;#39;re in mob ruka we can see</text>
  <text start="777.11" dur="6.35">there&amp;#39;s 45 US Special Forces they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="6.51">been deployed there we see I in isa</text>
  <text start="783.46" dur="5.95">there&amp;#39;s a base in that area there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="5.97">hundred US forces cobain 300 US Special</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="5.01">Forces have been deployed there and we</text>
  <text start="792.08" dur="4.53">are seeing the United States setting up</text>
  <text start="794.42" dur="4.95">these bases raising the flag and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="4.2">more and more troops being deployed in</text>
  <text start="799.37" dur="5.07">this area remember this is going to be</text>
  <text start="800.81" dur="6.78">used as a Ford launching area to go into</text>
  <text start="804.44" dur="5.19">Damascus and remove Assad and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="807.59" dur="4.56">using these ceasefires these peace deals</text>
  <text start="809.63" dur="5.58">as a stall tactic so they have time to</text>
  <text start="812.15" dur="6.53">build all of this and they are building</text>
  <text start="815.21" dur="8.31">it up very very quickly we see Obama</text>
  <text start="818.68" dur="7.42">well he has vetoed the 911 bill and we</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="5.1">can see right now that if supporters</text>
  <text start="826.1" dur="4.29">gather a two-thirds majority in both the</text>
  <text start="828.62" dur="3.029">set in the house they could override</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="3.509">Obama&amp;#39;s veto</text>
  <text start="831.649" dur="3.841">and it looks like and this is coming</text>
  <text start="833.899" dur="4.23">from the Senate Majority Leader Mitch</text>
  <text start="835.49" dur="4.529">McConnell saying that he believes that</text>
  <text start="838.129" dur="5.13">this can be done and this will be</text>
  <text start="840.019" dur="6.68">overridden now what happens if this is</text>
  <text start="843.259" dur="5.82">overridden well there&amp;#39;s a bigger problem</text>
  <text start="846.699" dur="4.06">because the Saudis already said that</text>
  <text start="849.079" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re gonna be selling US assets</text>
  <text start="850.759" dur="5.64">getting rid of the Treasury bonds if</text>
  <text start="852.679" dur="6.421">this happens and this is why Obama veto</text>
  <text start="856.399" dur="5">vetoed the bill right now because he</text>
  <text start="859.1" dur="5.82">knew that this would destroy the u.s.</text>
  <text start="861.399" dur="6.16">because all Saudi Arabia has to really</text>
  <text start="864.92" dur="4.62">do sell its assets and the Treasuries it</text>
  <text start="867.559" dur="5.31">did not have to bring down the World</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="6.659">Trade Center to do anything to do or</text>
  <text start="872.869" dur="4.77">destroy the United States they could</text>
  <text start="876.199" dur="3.271">have destroyed it with the stamp of a</text>
  <text start="877.639" dur="5.07">finger by selling their Treasuries and</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="6.179">assets but we can see this has all been</text>
  <text start="882.709" dur="6.961">set up right now because if the House</text>
  <text start="885.649" dur="7.081">and the Senate push this through the</text>
  <text start="889.67" dur="7.56">central bank the US government who can</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="7.919">they blame the people they can say that</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="6.93">people wanted this they destroyed the</text>
  <text start="900.649" dur="8.521">economy of the United States it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="904.16" dur="6.419">setup because once this happens the</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="3.329">system will collapse actually they need</text>
  <text start="910.579" dur="5.88">a movie about this called roll over and</text>
  <text start="912.499" dur="9.03">that was out 1981 where the Saudis sold</text>
  <text start="916.459" dur="7.97">their assets the Treasury bonds and the</text>
  <text start="921.529" dur="5.761">system imploded and it didn&amp;#39;t take long</text>
  <text start="924.429" dur="6.88">so from the very beginning of these 28</text>
  <text start="927.29" dur="6.81">pages this was a setup from the</text>
  <text start="931.309" dur="4.921">beginning because remember the central</text>
  <text start="934.1" dur="4.739">bank does not want to take blame for</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="4.289">what is about to happen Obama doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="938.839" dur="5.151">want to take blame for what is about to</text>
  <text start="940.519" dur="7.32">happen so this way when the people</text>
  <text start="943.99" dur="6.389">Senate the house decide to override</text>
  <text start="947.839" dur="5.37">Obama they&amp;#39;re going to turn around and</text>
  <text start="950.379" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re going to say because you did</text>
  <text start="953.209" dur="4.23">this the Saudis now are selling their</text>
  <text start="955.819" dur="5.281">assets they&amp;#39;re not even going to blame</text>
  <text start="957.439" dur="8.061">it on the Saudis and we can see right</text>
  <text start="961.1" dur="7.01">now this is the approach they are taking</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="5.88">and once this goes through this is</text>
  <text start="968.11" dur="8.55">another indicator that the entire system</text>
  <text start="971.38" dur="7.89">is about to implode so at this point we</text>
  <text start="976.66" dur="5.61">watch this very carefully if the Senate</text>
  <text start="979.27" dur="6.65">and the house push this through we will</text>
  <text start="982.27" dur="5.58">see a collapse coming very shortly</text>
  <text start="985.92" dur="4.21">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="987.85" dur="5.9">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="990.13" dur="3.62">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
  <text start="1010.06" dur="2.06">you</text>
