  <text start="38.84" dur="5.46">2015 and the title of this episode is</text>
  <text start="41.35" dur="7.23">IMF prepares for Greece default Russia</text>
  <text start="44.3" dur="6.57">and the BRICS Bank ask Greece to join</text>
  <text start="48.58" dur="3.64">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="50.87" dur="3.96">collapse news now we understand that</text>
  <text start="52.22" dur="4.92">Greece has been dealing with the IMF the</text>
  <text start="54.83" dur="4.31">Euro group trying to work out a deal</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="4.169">where you also understand that Greece is</text>
  <text start="59.14" dur="4.24">basically broke at this time they really</text>
  <text start="61.309" dur="5.461">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to continually make</text>
  <text start="63.38" dur="6.42">these huge payments I mean they went in</text>
  <text start="66.77" dur="5.34">they got the pension funds they asked</text>
  <text start="69.8" dur="4.76">all the municipalities listen we need</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="4.68">your cash they&amp;#39;re putting taxes on</text>
  <text start="74.56" dur="5.919">withdrawals they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="76.79" dur="5.67">possibly can to keep the system going by</text>
  <text start="80.479" dur="4.801">making the payments to the Eurogroup and</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="5.1">the IMF and we see that this cannot be</text>
  <text start="85.28" dur="4.56">sustained they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="87.56" dur="4.29">to do it we also understand that the</text>
  <text start="89.84" dur="4.86">Euro group with Greece they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="4.439">work out a deal and it seems at this</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="3.059">point right now that the Eurogroup</text>
  <text start="96.289" dur="4.021">meeting concluded without an agreement</text>
  <text start="97.759" dur="4.14">between Greece and its creditors so that</text>
  <text start="100.31" dur="4.47">completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="101.899" dur="6.481">now we also understand that the IMF</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="6.899">right now they are preparing for a Greek</text>
  <text start="108.38" dur="5.519">default contingency plan the</text>
  <text start="111.679" dur="4.261">International Monetary Fund is working</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="4.83">with national authorities in</text>
  <text start="115.94" dur="6.75">southeastern Europe on a contingency</text>
  <text start="118.729" dur="6.801">plan for a Greek default and this is</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="5.25">coming from a senior fund official and</text>
  <text start="125.53" dur="4.899">they are saying basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="5.07">doing is they want to ensure that these</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="4.771">subsidiaries of Greek banks have enough</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="3.99">assets that they can exchange for</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.5">emergency financing at their own central</text>
  <text start="137" dur="5.01">banks in case financing from their</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="5.009">parent institutions is suddenly cut off</text>
  <text start="142.01" dur="6.54">and that Deposit Insurance funds are at</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="6.78">sufficient levels so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="6.57">point in time it seems like in the back</text>
  <text start="151.489" dur="6.421">rooms discussions are being held and it</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="6.63">seems that Greece could be getting ready</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="6.18">to exit and then we have the news that</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="5.519">Russia and the</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="6.3">bricks bank system is asking Greece to</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="6.241">join Russian Deputy Finance Minister</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="6.9">Sergey Stewart Jack spoke with Alex</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="5.82">tsipras and basically he said listen we</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="5.19">want Greece to become the sixth member</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="5.73">of the new Development Bank you can join</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="5.58">Brazil Russia India China South Africa</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="6.8">and tsipras said listen we will discuss</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="8.399">this in st. Petersburg when we meet on</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="7.599">June 18th through June 20th so we can</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="8.011">see everything is in motion right now</text>
  <text start="199.459" dur="7.321">the IMF is planning on a default we</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="5.07">realize that the Eurogroup they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="5.13">to no agreement whatsoever and we see</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="5.729">that Russia and the BRIC system they are</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="6.63">extending a hand and saying listen we</text>
  <text start="215.269" dur="5.041">will help you if you need it now we can</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="4.14">see that Greece most likely will</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="5.13">eventually pivot towards these countries</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.339">because it&amp;#39;s going to be a very tough</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="5.04">time coming up with the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="228.019" dur="5.03">each one of these payments because the</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="5.849">Eurogroup the IMF to get these</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="5.59">additional funds which will put them</text>
  <text start="236.329" dur="6.27">further into debt they have to impose</text>
  <text start="238.639" dur="6.031">austerity on the people and the people</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="5.01">voted in this government because they</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="6.149">said we will not impose more austerity</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="5.46">and I could see this is why the Greek</text>
  <text start="250.819" dur="3.961">government right now is looking towards</text>
  <text start="253.069" dur="3.57">Russia and the BRIC systems but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="3.12">have to see how this plays out but from</text>
  <text start="256.639" dur="2.761">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and the indicators</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="5.579">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now it seems</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="7.35">like we&amp;#39;re heading in that direction now</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="6.711">out in the UK in Northern Ireland we see</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="6.09">things in the economy are not going well</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.539">April was the fourth month in the last</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="4.68">five on which business slowed down for</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="6.181">Northern Ireland with steep declines for</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="6.6">construction and retail and we see</text>
  <text start="280.91" dur="6.3">overall business activity is much slower</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="4.919">than some of the other regions in the UK</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="5.22">and this is starting to spread because</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="5.88">we understand it started out with Greece</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="3.77">Cyprus had spread to Italy Portugal</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="4.611">Spain</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="5.76">Frantz it moved up to the UK to Germany</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="4.47">and it&amp;#39;s continually spreading to all</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="4.08">these countries in every single one of</text>
  <text start="304" dur="6.42">these countries are feeling the effects</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="6.74">of the economy slowing down construction</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="5.37">and retail were among the poorest</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="6.07">performers shop owners reporting their</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="6.6">worst sales since 2012 construction</text>
  <text start="318.85" dur="7.8">right now it&amp;#39;s the lowest activity in</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="8.22">two years so right now we can see the</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.7">economy in Northern Ireland not doing</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="3.57">well and we&amp;#39;re having reports which I</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="4.92">reported on many many times from the UK</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="6.89">from Berman E the economies are starting</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="8.55">to slow we&amp;#39;re starting to see a break in</text>
  <text start="341.07" dur="6.16">the entire economic system here in the</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="4.43">United States what are we seeing well</text>
  <text start="347.23" dur="5.7">they put out the phony fake false</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="3.85">unemployment numbers of course that</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="3.6">unemployment number came down to five</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="4.92">point four percent and of course all</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="5.64">these jobs that they&amp;#39;re adding does not</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="5.28">connect to what&amp;#39;s really going on in the</text>
  <text start="362.17" dur="5.76">industry and I mean in the worldwide</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="6.09">economic indicators we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="4.23">jobs are being added but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="370.39" dur="4.86">increase in retail sales jobs are being</text>
  <text start="372.16" dur="6.24">added but there&amp;#39;s no increase in house</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="5.91">sales jobs are being added but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="5.82">see companies hiring jobs are being</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="6.36">added and we see part-time jobs being</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="6.15">added and we&amp;#39;re seeing continual layoffs</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="8.99">we see the BLS is not counted counting</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="9.98">those jobs that are laying off in the</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="7.93">energy sector in Texas and many other</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="5.83">states they&amp;#39;re just not counting it</text>
  <text start="404.44" dur="4.26">because we compared it between</text>
  <text start="406.18" dur="6.45">challenger grain Christmas a private</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="6.75">firm to BLS and there is huge</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="5.79">discrepancies so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="5.25">point in time things are not looking</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="5.84">good for the economy basically we are in</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="6.12">a collapse situation and it is</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="4.06">accelerating I mean think about this we</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="3.03">understand the real estate industry is</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="3.93">completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="429.85" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re bringing in hedge funds</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="4.92">investment companies there are</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="5.25">foreigners coming in with cash free</text>
  <text start="437.17" dur="3.51">money and they&amp;#39;re just buying homes</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re holding onto them the banks are</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="4.2">saying the banks have been told listen</text>
  <text start="442.6" dur="4.56">do not completely foreclose on houses</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="4.65">let people stay in there we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="3.96">them in the market we want the prices to</text>
  <text start="449.53" dur="3.18">go up and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="4.23">at this point because what we&amp;#39;ve seen is</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="6.35">that mortgage companies have been laying</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="6.78">off mortgage applications are declining</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="6.01">the interest rates have ticked up a</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="4.59">little bit and this throws more and more</text>
  <text start="465.07" dur="4.68">people out of the real estate market</text>
  <text start="466.72" dur="5.24">they can&amp;#39;t afford the houses and when we</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="5.58">look at the first-time homebuyers</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="6.94">normally in a normal situation in a</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="6.18">normal economic situation we see that</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="5.82">first-time homebuyers is about 45% right</text>
  <text start="481.51" dur="5.73">now we&amp;#39;re at 29% and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="4.5">first-time homebuyers we say hmmm how</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="7.5">long would it take a first time</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="9.18">homebuyer today to put down 20% on a</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="6.78">home and Lindsay David of LF economics</text>
  <text start="498.4" dur="5.4">he looked at 30 large US cities using</text>
  <text start="501.52" dur="4.62">their local median incomes and meeting</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="3.78">home prices it assumed that young</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="3.72">households could accomplish the tough</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="5.07">feat of saving about 5 percent of their</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="4.95">income year after year through bouts of</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="4.47">unemployment illness shop shopping</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.01">sprees family expansion and everything</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="6.6">else well guess what it takes them a</text>
  <text start="519.82" dur="6.51">very long time to do this in San Jose it</text>
  <text start="523.72" dur="3.84">would take someone almost 40 years to</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="4.04">come up with the money San Francisco</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="7.65">almost the same thing Los Angeles about</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="8.89">33 years Miami it would take someone 24</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="6.24">years Washington DC were looking at 20</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="6.81">years Charlotte North Carolina were</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="6.89">looking at 15 years because these youths</text>
  <text start="546.07" dur="5.03">who are cut graduating college</text>
  <text start="548.34" dur="5.38">graduating high school they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="5.53">finding the jobs the wages have not</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="6.12">increased to keep up with the inflated</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="4.71">housing prices and with the interest</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="2.8">rates ticking up a little bit it</text>
  <text start="561.34" dur="2.89">completely throws</text>
  <text start="562.64" dur="6.63">every one out of the market and this is</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="6.24">why we are seeing today these programs</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="3.21">where they&amp;#39;re saying listening you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="4.71">need any money down will actually pay</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="5.58">for your closing costs they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="575.18" dur="5.01">this to bring more people into the</text>
  <text start="578.06" dur="5.16">system but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="4.92">working because the American people they</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="5.16">are just completely tapped out they just</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="5.73">have nothing left and when we look at</text>
  <text start="588.38" dur="4.86">the lumber industry the lumber prices</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="5.4">are the most correlated with the</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="6.15">economic activity of all industrial</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="6.98">commodities well what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="599.39" dur="7.82">that the price of lumber is the Creason</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="6.91">the demand for lumber is decreasing and</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="5.38">when we look at the graphs and we look</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="6.45">at and we see what&amp;#39;s going on lumber is</text>
  <text start="612.59" dur="8.43">in a downward trajectory home builders</text>
  <text start="616.58" dur="8.1">and everything else is moving up how can</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="6.66">this be something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="624.68" dur="5.25">something doesn&amp;#39;t that correlate to what</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="5.03">we&amp;#39;re talking about here from the real</text>
  <text start="629.93" dur="6.3">economic indicators so again we go back</text>
  <text start="632.71" dur="5.14">to what we&amp;#39;ve said before it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="5.94">the private firms and all this economic</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="6.69">data is lying about unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="642.17" dur="6.56">inflation or the government is</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="6.81">manipulating the numbers massaging them</text>
  <text start="648.73" dur="5.44">lying to the American people to convince</text>
  <text start="651.35" dur="4.59">you that you are in a recovery and we</text>
  <text start="654.17" dur="7.05">can see at this point in time we are</text>
  <text start="655.94" dur="9.87">nowhere near a recovery whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="6.78">see Russia and the BRIC system they are</text>
  <text start="665.81" dur="4.92">starting to build right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668" dur="5.1">ratifying and bringing in the funds that</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="5.76">they need to push the bank</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="6.48">forward presidents of the South African</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="5.43">Republic and Russia Jacob Zuma and Putin</text>
  <text start="679.58" dur="3.99">discuss progress and establishment of</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="4.11">the new Development Bank of BRICS</text>
  <text start="683.57" dur="4.95">countries South Africa has been working</text>
  <text start="686.03" dur="4.77">actively on ratification of the</text>
  <text start="688.52" dur="4.86">agreements on the new bank and on the</text>
  <text start="690.8" dur="4.91">contingent reserve arrangement about</text>
  <text start="693.38" dur="5.81">which the member countries agreed at a</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="5.55">in 2014 a regional African Centre in</text>
  <text start="699.19" dur="4.02">Johannesburg will open simultaneously</text>
  <text start="701.26" dur="7.19">with opening the BRICS Bank headquarters</text>
  <text start="703.21" dur="8.91">in Shanghai we can see they are on a</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="5.98">path where they&amp;#39;re going to rival the</text>
  <text start="712.12" dur="4.35">private western central bank system now</text>
  <text start="714.43" dur="4.47">again like I said in the past does this</text>
  <text start="716.47" dur="6.66">mean this is going to be the best system</text>
  <text start="718.9" dur="5.43">ever no because as we know most likely</text>

  <text start="741.73" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re making tons of money they have</text>
  <text start="743.53" dur="7.2">control but we can see that the main</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="3.6">central bankers the elites they realize</text>
  <text start="750.73" dur="4.83">the system is coming down they</text>
  <text start="752.41" dur="6.36">understand that that system is dying we</text>
  <text start="755.56" dur="6">need to start a new one and every time</text>
  <text start="758.77" dur="5.76">they do this it includes a war and we</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="5.4">see this coming right now we see China</text>
  <text start="764.53" dur="4.62">and Russia they&amp;#39;re continually trading</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="4.92">not using the dollar they&amp;#39;re using the</text>

  <text start="782.08" dur="4.29">bankers are going to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="6.12">possibly can to stop this but I think</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="5.91">before this even occurs or if it does</text>
  <text start="789.07" dur="5.4">occur we are going to see war being</text>
  <text start="792.28" dur="4.47">provoked even further as we go</text>
  <text start="794.47" dur="5.58">throughout this year and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="7.17">more military assets being moved more</text>
  <text start="800.05" dur="6.39">provocations to really gin this up</text>
  <text start="803.92" dur="3.66">because they realize if they just sit</text>
  <text start="806.44" dur="4.5">back and do nothing</text>
  <text start="807.58" dur="4.83">these system collapses and everyone</text>
  <text start="810.94" dur="4.89">turns to them and says you are</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="7.05">responsible for this now again just</text>
  <text start="815.83" dur="5.97">because China Russia are starting the</text>
  <text start="819.46" dur="6.15">system as we know as time goes on the</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="6.39">system gets corrupt all of a sudden it</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="3.84">the new currency it&amp;#39;s not gold back this</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="4.86">is how they start out</text>
  <text start="829.45" dur="5.7">with it what we need to do as a people</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="3.6">is we need to take the system back we</text>
  <text start="835.15" dur="5.93">need to take it away from the central</text>
  <text start="836.65" dur="7.68">bankers and this is what we need to do</text>
  <text start="841.08" dur="5.35">at a certain point in time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="844.33" dur="6.54">getting closer and closer to that point</text>
  <text start="846.43" dur="7.26">in time out in Detroit it looks like</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="7.35">right now the people are going to be</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="6.9">getting a notice that their water is</text>
  <text start="858.22" dur="7.65">going to be shut off I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.59" dur="7.56">looking at 20 to 25,000 residential</text>
  <text start="865.87" dur="4.11">accounts will be getting this notice now</text>
  <text start="868.15" dur="2.58">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="869.98" dur="3.42">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="6.72">central bankers have no problem giving</text>
  <text start="873.4" dur="6.39">aid to every single country around the</text>
  <text start="877.45" dur="4.5">world and it&amp;#39;s not for humanitarian</text>
  <text start="879.79" dur="4.38">reasons it&amp;#39;s the payoff government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.95" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s to bring in military assets like</text>
  <text start="884.17" dur="6.96">you have you know 200 million 25 million</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="8.25">to boost the Ukrainian army couple</text>
  <text start="891.13" dur="6.33">hundred million to Israel you know</text>
  <text start="895.33" dur="4.86">millions of dollars to Saudi Arabia to</text>
  <text start="897.46" dur="6.33">bomb Yemen then 68 million for</text>
  <text start="900.19" dur="5.67">humanitarian aid after the bombing but</text>
  <text start="903.79" dur="3.54">they do nothing here for the people of</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="3.93">the United States that&amp;#39;s where that</text>
  <text start="907.33" dur="5.31">money should be spent but again our</text>
  <text start="909.79" dur="7.59">system is so corrupt by the central</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="6.6">bankers it doesn&amp;#39;t profit them to do</text>
  <text start="917.38" dur="6.21">anything here in this country because</text>
  <text start="919.24" dur="6.06">this country is broke it&amp;#39;s dead so they</text>
  <text start="923.59" dur="4.38">go out to other place and say okay you</text>
  <text start="925.3" dur="5.99">owe interest on this money and you have</text>
  <text start="927.97" dur="6.27">to pay it back because their system is</text>
  <text start="931.29" dur="6.07">based on debt the more debt out there</text>
  <text start="934.24" dur="6.81">the better they are the more profit they</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="6.21">make and we can see right now from the</text>
  <text start="941.05" dur="5.66">way the United States government does</text>
  <text start="943.57" dur="6.66">everything it&amp;#39;s nothing for the people</text>
  <text start="946.71" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re doing absolutely nothing for the</text>
  <text start="950.23" dur="5.28">people right now they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="5.4">everything for themselves and the</text>
  <text start="955.51" dur="5.79">central bankers and corporations period</text>
  <text start="957.94" dur="4.84">that&amp;#39;s it and they just continually lie</text>
  <text start="961.3" dur="4.18">to everyone at this</text>
  <text start="962.78" dur="5.69">time we see the number of Americans</text>
  <text start="965.48" dur="5.73">renouncing US citizenship continually</text>
  <text start="968.47" dur="7.84">inches up actually it has reached</text>
  <text start="971.21" dur="7.86">all-time highs last quarter in fact 1335</text>
  <text start="976.31" dur="3.87">people decided you know what we had</text>
  <text start="979.07" dur="2.94">enough and the reason why this is</text>
  <text start="980.18" dur="4.44">happening is because the united states</text>
  <text start="982.01" dur="4.95">government enacted the new law called</text>
  <text start="984.62" dur="6.56">FATCA where they go and they find these</text>
  <text start="986.96" dur="6.54">people who are you know supposedly as</text>
  <text start="991.18" dur="4.15">they would say hiding money which</text>
  <text start="993.5" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re not hiding it they have it in</text>
  <text start="995.33" dur="3.6">bank accounts because they&amp;#39;re working in</text>
  <text start="996.68" dur="4.65">different countries they want a piece of</text>
  <text start="998.93" dur="6.29">that because this is what happens with a</text>
  <text start="1001.33" dur="6.48">dying Society they look for revenue</text>
  <text start="1005.22" dur="4.6">anywhere they can possibly find it and</text>
  <text start="1007.81" dur="4.68">this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing out all</text>
  <text start="1009.82" dur="5.13">these draconian bills and laws like</text>
  <text start="1012.49" dur="5.16">Obamacare you can see the carbon tax</text>
  <text start="1014.95" dur="4.5">coming up for global warming because</text>
  <text start="1017.65" dur="4.62">they have to raise revenue there looked</text>
  <text start="1019.45" dur="6.72">using FATCA to go around the globe and</text>
  <text start="1022.27" dur="6.75">look for more revenue because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1026.17" dur="4.65">have enough to pay for the debt and if</text>
  <text start="1029.02" dur="5.67">these interest rates inch up a little</text>
  <text start="1030.82" dur="5.82">bit they won&amp;#39;t be able to pay it the</text>
  <text start="1034.69" dur="4.98">whole system will come down crumbling</text>
  <text start="1036.64" dur="5.79">down it will not be they couldn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="1039.67" dur="6.33">cannot sustain it whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.43" dur="6.81">impossible we see Donald Trump is out</text>
  <text start="1046" dur="5.79">there he&amp;#39;s even saying the TPP trade</text>
  <text start="1049.24" dur="4.38">deal is a complete disaster the United</text>
  <text start="1051.79" dur="3.66">States will lose thousands upon</text>
  <text start="1053.62" dur="4.05">thousands of jobs well yeah that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1055.45" dur="6.39">we we saw it with NAFTA we saw it with</text>
  <text start="1057.67" dur="7.59">Obama&amp;#39;s a job push or trade deal with</text>
  <text start="1061.84" dur="5.94">South Korea in 2011 about 50,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="1065.26" dur="5.58">were lost they&amp;#39;re everything they</text>
  <text start="1067.78" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve done where they continually tell</text>
  <text start="1070.84" dur="5.73">us it&amp;#39;s gonna create jobs has anyone</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="6.33">really seen it or have we lost more and</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="5.58">more manufacturing jobs and this is why</text>
  <text start="1079.57" dur="4.77">they keep these bills a secret they</text>
  <text start="1082.15" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t want people to know what is really</text>
  <text start="1084.34" dur="3.9">going on that it&amp;#39;s not for the people</text>
  <text start="1085.93" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s for the bankers it&amp;#39;s for the</text>
  <text start="1088.24" dur="6.51">corporations it&amp;#39;s for the elite and this</text>
  <text start="1091.27" dur="6.57">is why they keep everything a secret</text>
  <text start="1094.75" dur="4.86">and like I said those congressmen and</text>
  <text start="1097.84" dur="4.47">Congresswomen who want to see it they</text>
  <text start="1099.61" dur="3.9">have to go into a secret room they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1102.31" dur="4.11">bring their phone they can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="1103.51" dur="4.83">cameras they can&amp;#39;t take notes because if</text>
  <text start="1106.42" dur="5.37">they do they&amp;#39;re confiscated and they</text>
  <text start="1108.34" dur="5.49">can&amp;#39;t discuss it after they read it so</text>
  <text start="1111.79" dur="4.17">right there and then it&amp;#39;s something you</text>
  <text start="1113.83" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t want to vote on and of course</text>
  <text start="1115.96" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re using all its national security</text>
  <text start="1117.13" dur="7.26">now they use national security way too</text>
  <text start="1121.54" dur="4.92">much to keep everything a secret and</text>
  <text start="1124.39" dur="3.96">every time they use national security</text>
  <text start="1126.46" dur="4.14">red flag should be going up all over the</text>
  <text start="1128.35" dur="3.54">place ah the reason why they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="1130.6" dur="5.4">is because they don&amp;#39;t want the people to</text>
  <text start="1131.89" dur="7.53">know what&amp;#39;s really going on now we</text>
  <text start="1136" dur="6.66">understand the US government the Patriot</text>
  <text start="1139.42" dur="5.67">Act will expire June 1st and of course</text>
  <text start="1142.66" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re trying to push forth the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1145.09" dur="3.72">Freedom Act which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1147.43" dur="3.15">ridiculous all these titles that they</text>
  <text start="1148.81" dur="3.36">put on all these bills like the</text>
  <text start="1150.58" dur="4.05">Affordable Care Act which is not</text>
  <text start="1152.17" dur="5.1">affordable the Patriot Act which is</text>
  <text start="1154.63" dur="5.1">nowhere near any patron nothing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1157.27" dur="5.01">patriotic about it the u.s. Freedom Act</text>
  <text start="1159.73" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s no freedom in it whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1162.28" dur="3.93">always the opposite of what the title is</text>
  <text start="1164.2" dur="3.33">but we understand that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1166.21" dur="3">spying on the American people even</text>
  <text start="1167.53" dur="3.24">without these bills they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1169.21" dur="4.05">about the laws they just bypass them</text>
  <text start="1170.77" dur="4.83">completely but most people don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="1173.26" dur="5.78">that the words they speak are not</text>
  <text start="1175.6" dur="6.09">private in phone conversation basically</text>
  <text start="1179.04" dur="4.93">out of the top secret documents from</text>
  <text start="1181.69" dur="3.84">Edward Snowden they show that the</text>
  <text start="1183.97" dur="3.51">National Security Agency can now</text>
  <text start="1185.53" dur="4.8">automatically recognize the content</text>
  <text start="1187.48" dur="5.25">within phone calls by creating rough</text>
  <text start="1190.33" dur="4.47">transcripts and phonetic representations</text>
  <text start="1192.73" dur="4.92">that can be easily searched and stored</text>
  <text start="1194.8" dur="5.01">actually YouTube does this right now on</text>
  <text start="1197.65" dur="4.74">videos if you&amp;#39;ve ever taken a look at it</text>
  <text start="1199.81" dur="5.19">you go to the I think it&amp;#39;s a share tab</text>
  <text start="1202.39" dur="4.29">and you go to transcripts it transcribes</text>
  <text start="1205" dur="3.48">what is being said in the video</text>
  <text start="1206.68" dur="4.89">automatically now is a perfect no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1208.48" dur="4.68">not but they look for keywords and this</text>
  <text start="1211.57" dur="3.96">is what the NSA does they take it they</text>
  <text start="1213.16" dur="6.9">transcribe it and they look for keywords</text>
  <text start="1215.53" dur="7.26">and they use that to see ah let&amp;#39;s see</text>

  <text start="1230.59" dur="3.99">that they&amp;#39;re looking for and they</text>
  <text start="1232.09" dur="5.309">correlate all the information into a</text>

  <text start="1237.399" dur="5.66">they compare to your emails your text</text>
  <text start="1240.1" dur="5.429">and they start to create a profile about</text>
  <text start="1243.059" dur="5.62">each person and if they need that</text>
  <text start="1245.529" dur="6.03">information later on they pull it up out</text>
  <text start="1248.679" dur="5.97">of the database system and this is what</text>

  <text start="1366.14" dur="2.49">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for this I mean</text>
  <text start="1367.28" dur="2.94">we see on the White House they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1389.05" dur="3.94">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="1391.37" dur="6.36">that they prepare they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="1392.99" dur="6.48">for this since 2008 and back then as we</text>
  <text start="1397.73" dur="5.73">remember the system came crumbling down</text>
  <text start="1399.47" dur="6.62">and of course as any fascistic system</text>
  <text start="1403.46" dur="4.71">they build out all the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1406.09" dur="4.87">instead of letting the system completely</text>
  <text start="1408.17" dur="5.43">crumble apart and restart so they</text>
  <text start="1410.96" dur="4.92">decided to bail out all these</text>
  <text start="1413.6" dur="6.39">corporations that made very bad business</text>
  <text start="1415.88" dur="7.62">decisions and the people are basically</text>
  <text start="1419.99" dur="6">holding the tab for all this and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1423.5" dur="5.64">been pumping the system up as best they</text>
  <text start="1425.99" dur="4.4">could for the last seven years of course</text>
  <text start="1429.14" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re doing a lot of manipulation</text>
  <text start="1430.39" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone that everything</text>
  <text start="1432.44" dur="6.98">is fine there weren&amp;#39;t a recovery but</text>
  <text start="1435.05" dur="8.22">since 2008 a u.s. department of defense</text>
  <text start="1439.42" dur="6.58">research program is funding universities</text>
  <text start="1443.27" dur="6.75">to model the dynamics risks and tipping</text>
  <text start="1446" dur="6.96">points for a large scale civil unrest</text>
  <text start="1450.02" dur="8.49">across the world under the supervision</text>
  <text start="1452.96" dur="9.15">of various US military agencies this is</text>
  <text start="1458.51" dur="6.78">a multi-million dollar program designed</text>
  <text start="1462.11" dur="8.73">to develop immediate and long-term war</text>
  <text start="1465.29" dur="12.03">fighter relevant insights so what are</text>
  <text start="1470.84" dur="9">they doing here they knew from 2008 even</text>
  <text start="1477.32" dur="6.6">before this that this system cannot be</text>
  <text start="1479.84" dur="7.62">sustained the debt level the economic</text>
  <text start="1483.92" dur="6.39">system is crashing it actually crashed</text>
  <text start="1487.46" dur="5.28">in 2008 and all they did was print a lot</text>
  <text start="1490.31" dur="4.1">of money at that time to bail out not</text>
  <text start="1492.74" dur="4.01">the people not</text>
  <text start="1494.41" dur="4.86">the spur economic growth it was to bail</text>
  <text start="1496.75" dur="7.53">out themselves corporations and banks</text>
  <text start="1499.27" dur="7.16">and to keep this system going and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1504.28" dur="6.15">complete illusion it&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="1506.43" dur="8.47">and we can see that this program uses</text>
  <text start="1510.43" dur="6.63">social media Twitter posts conversations</text>
  <text start="1514.9" dur="5.88">that they examine to identify</text>
  <text start="1517.06" dur="7.62">individuals mobilized in a social</text>
  <text start="1520.78" dur="5.97">contagion and when these people become</text>
  <text start="1524.68" dur="4.98">mobilized so they&amp;#39;re looking at this to</text>
  <text start="1526.75" dur="5.7">see let&amp;#39;s take a look let&amp;#39;s listen in</text>
  <text start="1529.66" dur="6.39">and let&amp;#39;s see when they are going to be</text>
  <text start="1532.45" dur="5.4">mobilized and ready to go so does the US</text>
  <text start="1536.05" dur="3.81">Department of Defense seem protest</text>
  <text start="1537.85" dur="4.17">movements and social activism in</text>
  <text start="1539.86" dur="6.09">different parts of the world as a threat</text>
  <text start="1542.02" dur="5.52">to US national security if so why does</text>
  <text start="1545.95" dur="3.63">the US Department of Defense consider</text>
  <text start="1547.54" dur="4.26">political movement aiming for</text>
  <text start="1549.58" dur="4.11">large-scale political and economic</text>
  <text start="1551.8" dur="3.89">change as a national security matter if</text>
  <text start="1553.69" dur="4.68">so why</text>
  <text start="1555.69" dur="5.05">activism protests political movements</text>
  <text start="1558.37" dur="5.6">and of course NGOs are a vital element</text>
  <text start="1560.74" dur="6.3">of a healthy civil society and democracy</text>
  <text start="1563.97" dur="5.23">why is it that the DoD is funding</text>
  <text start="1567.04" dur="4.14">research to investigate such issues</text>
  <text start="1569.2" dur="5.85">because they realize and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1571.18" dur="5.4">to understand and locate those people</text>
  <text start="1575.05" dur="4.71">who are going to be a threat to their</text>
  <text start="1576.58" dur="5.91">authority and they want to understand</text>
  <text start="1579.76" dur="5.67">where these things break out and how</text>
  <text start="1582.49" dur="5.97">they form and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1585.43" dur="6.24">studying all along because not just the</text>
  <text start="1588.46" dur="5.1">US but the European nations they are</text>
  <text start="1591.67" dur="5.73">getting ready for this this is what</text>
  <text start="1593.56" dur="8.25">happened when we saw the terror in</text>
  <text start="1597.4" dur="8.7">Canada Australia France Belgium now the</text>
  <text start="1601.81" dur="8.22">United States it allowed the countries</text>
  <text start="1606.1" dur="5.85">to put draconian laws on the books</text>
  <text start="1610.03" dur="4.47">basically what it does it takes away</text>
  <text start="1611.95" dur="5.16">your rights it allows them to control</text>
  <text start="1614.5" dur="7.05">the people it allowed them to put</text>
  <text start="1617.11" dur="5.73">military personnel on the streets they</text>
  <text start="1621.55" dur="3.39">tried to do it here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1622.84" dur="5.04">but it was a botched operation in Texas</text>
  <text start="1624.94" dur="4.71">will they try again most likely</text>
  <text start="1627.88" dur="4.08">because they are definitely preparing us</text>
  <text start="1629.65" dur="6.87">for two things here to bring more</text>
  <text start="1631.96" dur="7.53">military on the streets to say ah this</text>
  <text start="1636.52" dur="8.039">is why we need the training like Jade</text>
  <text start="1639.49" dur="8.04">helm to get us ready for the next event</text>
  <text start="1644.559" dur="5.821">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="1647.53" dur="6.45">preparing for this is why we see</text>
  <text start="1650.38" dur="5.039">millions of rounds for DHS this is why</text>
  <text start="1653.98" dur="5.28">we see the nationalization of police</text>
  <text start="1655.419" dur="5.941">forces this is why DHS is giving local</text>
  <text start="1659.26" dur="4.32">police department tanks which they</text>
  <text start="1661.36" dur="5.01">absolutely don&amp;#39;t need for a small little</text>
  <text start="1663.58" dur="7.04">town this is why we see them giving them</text>
  <text start="1666.37" dur="6.45">fatigues machine guns Kevlar vests</text>
  <text start="1670.62" dur="5.89">stingray systems where they can spy on</text>
  <text start="1672.82" dur="7.08">the local people all of this is being</text>
  <text start="1676.51" dur="6.18">done on purpose they&amp;#39;ve been planning</text>
  <text start="1679.9" dur="5.519">and getting ready for this for quite a</text>
  <text start="1682.69" dur="7.65">while and not just the u.s. other</text>
  <text start="1685.419" dur="7.321">countries because they realize they</text>
  <text start="1690.34" dur="6.75">definitely have a situation coming and</text>
  <text start="1692.74" dur="6.299">it&amp;#39;s a huge situation and we can see</text>
  <text start="1697.09" dur="4.44">already going back to 2008 when they</text>
  <text start="1699.039" dur="4.681">discussed what would happen if we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1701.53" dur="4.649">bail out these corporations we&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="1703.72" dur="4.77">riots on the street we have mass panic</text>
  <text start="1706.179" dur="5.49">people would lose work the economy would</text>
  <text start="1708.49" dur="4.62">completely fall apart and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1711.669" dur="5.281">going to happen now but it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1713.11" dur="6.38">a hundred times worse because we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1716.95" dur="4.38">hundred times worse than we were in 2008</text>
  <text start="1719.49" dur="5.02">things didn&amp;#39;t get better</text>
  <text start="1721.33" dur="6.209">it was just masked over it was an</text>
  <text start="1724.51" dur="5.43">illusion to make you think things have</text>
  <text start="1727.539" dur="4.231">improved this is why the government is</text>
  <text start="1729.94" dur="4.859">out there continually telling you that</text>
  <text start="1731.77" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1734.799" dur="4.051">feel that Obama actually came out and</text>
  <text start="1736.419" dur="6.24">said listen I&amp;#39;m telling you we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1738.85" dur="7.11">recovery even though you don&amp;#39;t feel it</text>
  <text start="1742.659" dur="5.88">think about it go back to 2008 the</text>
  <text start="1745.96" dur="6.57">Federal Reserve the central bankers told</text>
  <text start="1748.539" dur="7.76">us in that year we had a crash they were</text>
  <text start="1752.53" dur="7.71">not forecasting any type of recession</text>
  <text start="1756.299" dur="5.351">whatsoever that everything is contained</text>
  <text start="1760.24" dur="3.27">the subprime</text>
  <text start="1761.65" dur="5.73">completely contain nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="1763.51" dur="6.06">about they lie so whenever you hear them</text>
  <text start="1767.38" dur="4.649">whenever you hear a central bank or</text>
  <text start="1769.57" dur="3.87">government official it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="1772.029" dur="7.621">opposite of what you&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1773.44" dur="10.5">telling you now out in France we</text>
  <text start="1779.65" dur="7.47">understand Russia ordered to Mistral</text>
  <text start="1783.94" dur="5.16">helicopter carriers and of course the US</text>
  <text start="1787.12" dur="5.01">is putting pressure on France not to</text>
  <text start="1789.1" dur="4.11">sell them and we see NATO was gonna try</text>
  <text start="1792.13" dur="3">to buy them but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1793.21" dur="4.469">funds to do this and we see that right</text>
  <text start="1795.13" dur="4.409">now Russia is saying no no France cannot</text>
  <text start="1797.679" dur="4.74">sell the Mistral helicopter carriers</text>
  <text start="1799.539" dur="5.49">without Moscow&amp;#39;s permission because</text>
  <text start="1802.419" dur="4.531">Russia had the end-user certificate for</text>
  <text start="1805.029" dur="4.081">the stern parts of the ship which were</text>
  <text start="1806.95" dur="4.02">built in st. Petersburg before being</text>
  <text start="1809.11" dur="4.98">transported to France for a further</text>
  <text start="1810.97" dur="5.22">assembly France is unable to use the</text>
  <text start="1814.09" dur="3.959">Mistral ships for its own purposes as</text>
  <text start="1816.19" dur="3.51">they were built and adapted to meet the</text>
  <text start="1818.049" dur="2.901">specifications provided by the Russian</text>
  <text start="1819.7" dur="4.26">Navy</text>
  <text start="1820.95" dur="4.9">so basically France is stuck with these</text>
  <text start="1823.96" dur="5.37">ships and they can&amp;#39;t do anything with</text>
  <text start="1825.85" dur="5.85">them at this point in time and basically</text>
  <text start="1829.33" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to refund Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1831.7" dur="5.13">money if Russia says listen you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1835.45" dur="3.92">deliver the ships then we want our money</text>
  <text start="1836.83" dur="6.69">back and this is going to hurt the</text>
  <text start="1839.37" dur="7.049">economy of France even further now John</text>

  <text start="2331.13" dur="7.38">they want is their little area the</text>
  <text start="2334.76" dur="6.96">losers needed time to rebuild to train</text>
  <text start="2338.51" dur="4.59">to bring in new weapons so this is how</text>

  <text start="2392.84" dur="3.99">this is during the drills and they</text>
  <text start="2394.94" dur="5.13">always seem to have some type of story</text>
  <text start="2396.83" dur="8.33">that they push out into the media for</text>
  <text start="2400.07" dur="8.22">propaganda purposes we see now that</text>
  <text start="2405.16" dur="5.08">China is making deals with Djibouti we</text>
