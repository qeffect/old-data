  <text start="70.65" dur="6.899">a problem they need some cash they had a</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="6.119">bailout of around 4.1 billion in euros</text>
  <text start="77.549" dur="6.121">and now they need some more money and</text>

  <text start="116.189" dur="6.42">start doing some balance at this point</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="6.36">and and we can see that most of the</text>
  <text start="122.609" dur="4.44">banks are having the same problems</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="4.47">because what&amp;#39;s happening is every</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="4.111">country is saying you know what there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="5.429">just no more bailouts we are done with</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="6.03">this use the US said it UK said it this</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.351">eurozone is saying it right now and this</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="3.42">is why the the country is not bailing</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="2.7">them out</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="4.62">why they&amp;#39;re looking for the three</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="5.46">billion euros to help out Australia said</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="4.5">it can is saying it and this is why they</text>

  <text start="149.73" dur="5.88">the blueprint of how to do a Balin and</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="4.62">of course cyprus was the template they</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="4.2">saw how that work that work pretty well</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="3.99">know what there were no riots no one did</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="3.33">anything and they think they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="5.1">going to go and do this again throughout</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="5.25">Europe the US UK Australia Canada and</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="3.93">this is what they are planning on doing</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="4.65">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they take</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="5.01">the next step and do some balance if no</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="3.57">outside interest comes in and gives them</text>
  <text start="175.32" dur="5.22">the three billion euros that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="6.96">looking for now there is a report that</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="5.13">the u.s. is starting an economic fight</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="3.84">with China right now the United States</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="4.5">is reportedly seeking a new agreement</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="4.71">with European Union and Pacific Rim</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="4.23">countries in order to stop China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.65">growing economic power and we have to</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="5.1">remember that China said they don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="5.55">the benefit of taking on more US debt or</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.82">holding US dollars Russia has already</text>
  <text start="202.32" dur="4.44">said that the u.s. dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="3.36">collapse they don&amp;#39;t want their people</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="4.62">inside the country taking on more US</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="5.25">dollars and both Russia China and other</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="6.329">nations are actually starting to sell</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="6.33">their Treasury bonds and right now the</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="5.461">deal was planned because Washington is</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="5.1">worried the US could lose influence to</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="4.74">China Congress on the White House are</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="5.849">pushing broad trade deals that risk</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="6.27">triggering an economic fight with China</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="5.851">and China is coming out in the same well</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="5.3">that these agreements will be an act by</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="6.03">the u.s. to try to force changes in</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="5.89">China&amp;#39;s domestic laws and we can see</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.04">what is happening right now the you one</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="5.399">and what China is doing all around the</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="5.4">world is a huge threat to the private</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.581">western central banks and we can see</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="5.37">that China has been making deals with</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.43">England has made deals with Africa has</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="6.21">made deals with Russia with Iran with</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="7.23">Syria is talking to the Saudis making</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="6.63">deals with Egypt and Australia and many</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.25">of Brazil many other nations and they</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="4.11">are making deals all over the place pump</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="4.41">money in two different countries like</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="5.19">Afghanistan into Central Africa into</text>
  <text start="278.67" dur="5.97">Sudan and building their infrastructure</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="7.11">and helping them bind and and build</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="6.69">their natural resource infrastructure so</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="6.33">eventually when the u1 takes control and</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="5.07">is the reserve currency they will be</text>
  <text start="294.48" dur="4.14">doing exactly what the United States did</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="4.26">in the beginning and right after World</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="4.98">War two where they became the world</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="5.52">reserve currency and we can see that</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="5.01">this is all unfolding right now and the</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="4.17">u.s. of course is very worried about</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="5.1">this and we have to remember this is why</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="6.09">the fed is buying all these Treasury</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="5.4">bonds every month which was a 85 billion</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="4.47">total and because most of the countries</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="5.03">are not purchasing and for the</text>
  <text start="320.91" dur="6.75">government to borrow money they issued</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="5.83">Treasury bonds and countries have to</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="3.54">purchase these but no one is and most of</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="3.51">the countries are starting to sell them</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="4.41">and the Fed is sitting there buying</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="5.88">these Treasury bonds and let me just say</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="6.3">that the set is going to have to</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="4.89">increase QE because as more and more</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="4.62">countries see that the u.s. is in</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="5.37">trouble they&amp;#39;re going to start unloading</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="6.35">their Treasury bonds and the Fed is then</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="6.51">going to have to keep purchasing as</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="5.89">these countries unload them because they</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="8.67">are pretty much the only ones that are</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="9.09">purchasing at this time now the LAPD is</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="5.97">deploying drug detection swab test at</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="4.56">different checkpoints right now and what</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re taking some DNA</text>
  <text start="372.42" dur="5.97">from you putting it into the DNA</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="7.05">database and right now it the driver it</text>
  <text start="378.39" dur="4.47">is voluntary right now and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="3.36">this in many many different states or</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="3.63">receiving grants and money to do this</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="5.4">because what they&amp;#39;re really trying to do</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="5.88">is create a DNA DNA database we saw this</text>
  <text start="390" dur="4.74">happen in Texas we&amp;#39;re seeing it in LA</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="4.56">right now and we will see this start to</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="5.04">spread all across the country because we</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="6">have to remember what they are doing DHS</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="5.82">is giving local law enforcement grants</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="4.84">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is create</text>
  <text start="405.6" dur="5.069">a massive DNA</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="5.25">database system so they can identify</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="5.71">every single person and this goes along</text>
  <text start="413.02" dur="5.04">with NSA with the fusion centers where</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re spying on everyone creating</text>
  <text start="418.06" dur="5.34">social profiles facial recognition and</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="7.889">then they&amp;#39;ll just link to the DNA to</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="7.889">confirm all this information ok now</text>
  <text start="429.069" dur="4.741">Uzbekistan has become the ninth country</text>

  <text start="690.96" dur="7.08">investigating a military-style raid on</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="5.65">California power station US officials</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="4.53">warn about attacks on electrical power</text>
  <text start="700.2" dur="4.77">facilities these days the first thing</text>
  <text start="702.57" dur="4.68">that comes to all of our minds is it was</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="5.97">a cyberattack which is going to shut</text>
  <text start="707.25" dur="6.87">down the power grid by using some type</text>
  <text start="710.94" dur="6.27">of malware virus being placed into the</text>
  <text start="714.12" dur="5.46">system but a more traditional attack on</text>
  <text start="717.21" dur="5.1">a power station in California as US</text>
  <text start="719.58" dur="4.74">officials puzzled and worried about the</text>
  <text start="722.31" dur="4.89">physical security of electrical grid</text>
  <text start="724.32" dur="6.84">from attack from attackers who come in</text>
  <text start="727.2" dur="6.03">with guns blazing initially the attack</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="4.56">was being treated as vandalism and</text>
  <text start="733.23" dur="4.29">handled by local law enforcement the</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="5.01">senior intelligence official said</text>
  <text start="737.52" dur="5.91">however investigators have been quoted</text>
  <text start="740.73" dur="5.64">in the press expressing opinions that</text>
  <text start="743.43" dur="5.31">there are indications that the timing of</text>
  <text start="746.37" dur="5.16">the attacks and target selection</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="6.12">indicate a higher level of planning and</text>
  <text start="751.53" dur="8.31">sophistication the FBI has taken over</text>
  <text start="754.86" dur="7.86">the case right now they were these were</text>
  <text start="759.84" dur="4.8">not amateurs taking potshots mark</text>
  <text start="762.72" dur="6.96">johnson a former vice president for</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="6.93">transmission operations and PG and E he</text>
  <text start="769.68" dur="4.98">said this last month at a conference on</text>
  <text start="771.57" dur="6.09">grid security held in Philadelphia his</text>
  <text start="774.66" dur="6.09">personal opinion and his personal view</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="7.14">is that this was a dress rehearsal for</text>
  <text start="780.75" dur="6.15">future attacks on the infrastructure now</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ve heard this before in different</text>
  <text start="786.9" dur="4.4">areas we&amp;#39;ve heard there was a memo going</text>
  <text start="789.15" dur="5.34">around that there were dry runs on</text>
  <text start="791.3" dur="6.67">airplanes then we heard that airplanes</text>
  <text start="794.49" dur="7.44">can easily be cyber attacked and taken</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="6.45">over now we&amp;#39;re seeing the power grid</text>
  <text start="801.93" dur="5.4">they were talking about cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="804.42" dur="3.87">but now we&amp;#39;re seeing that this could</text>
  <text start="807.33" dur="4.02">have been age</text>
  <text start="808.29" dur="5.31">rehearsal for some type of future attack</text>
  <text start="811.35" dur="4.59">and this goes on to say that the attack</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="4.47">points to an arguably overlooked</text>
  <text start="815.94" dur="4.41">physical threat to power facilities at a</text>
  <text start="818.07" dur="4.62">time when much of the US intelligence</text>
  <text start="820.35" dur="4.89">community Congress and the electrical</text>
  <text start="822.69" dur="7.56">power industry is focused on the risk of</text>
  <text start="825.24" dur="7.019">cyber attacks and we can see that I</text>
  <text start="830.25" dur="4.199">remember reporting on this going back a</text>
  <text start="832.259" dur="4.351">couple was like a month or two months</text>
  <text start="834.449" dur="3.781">ago that there was some type of an</text>
  <text start="836.61" dur="4.169">attack and they thought it was vandalism</text>
  <text start="838.23" dur="5.45">and now the FBI is looking into it</text>
  <text start="840.779" dur="8.101">because they believe it was some type of</text>
  <text start="843.68" dur="7.93">dry run and we all know who probably and</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="4.139">most likely did the dry run it was</text>
  <text start="851.61" dur="3.599">probably the FBI and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="853.019" dur="3.87">needed to take over and they were</text>
  <text start="855.209" dur="2.94">probably getting the lay of the land and</text>
  <text start="856.889" dur="4.021">this is probably going on in many</text>
  <text start="858.149" dur="4.981">different areas and it makes it easier</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="5.58">for them to do the actual attack when</text>
  <text start="863.13" dur="6.42">the time comes and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="866.49" dur="6.209">there are ways that a very few number of</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="6">actors with very rudimentary equipment</text>
  <text start="872.699" dur="6.12">could take down large portions of our</text>
  <text start="875.55" dur="6.659">grid I don&amp;#39;t think we have a level of</text>
  <text start="878.819" dur="8.401">physical security we need in each of our</text>
  <text start="882.209" dur="8.19">power grid locations and I can see how</text>
  <text start="887.22" dur="5.97">this is all starting to come together</text>
  <text start="890.399" dur="5.701">right now of course Janet Napolitano</text>
  <text start="893.19" dur="4.709">said that you know in the future there</text>
  <text start="896.1" dur="4.95">is going to be some type of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="897.899" dur="5.521">not if but when it could be a natural</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="5.849">attack but the there will be some type</text>
  <text start="903.42" dur="8.909">of attack on the infrastructure and we</text>
  <text start="906.899" dur="10.351">can see if the cyber attack doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="912.329" dur="7.411">or if it does work could be used with</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="7.31">some type of physical attack to make</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="8.55">sure the power grid does come down and</text>
  <text start="924.56" dur="6.219">this is all being set up right now for</text>
  <text start="928.29" dur="6.81">what is coming because we have to</text>
  <text start="930.779" dur="6.75">remember the US economy the European</text>
  <text start="935.1" dur="6.69">economy is teetering right now on</text>
  <text start="937.529" dur="6.661">collapse so they need some type of</text>
  <text start="941.79" dur="5.55">meant to blame this on one of those</text>
  <text start="944.19" dur="6.51">countries that are no longer or have</text>
  <text start="947.34" dur="7.56">never been controlled by the western</text>
  <text start="950.7" dur="6.75">central bankers and they need this to</text>
  <text start="954.9" dur="4.08">happen very soon because the Fed has</text>
  <text start="957.45" dur="3.39">already said they&amp;#39;re going to taper</text>
  <text start="958.98" dur="3.72">which they have not done yet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="960.84" dur="3.66">going to start this in January we</text>
  <text start="962.7" dur="5.01">understand that the debt ceiling debate</text>
  <text start="964.5" dur="7.23">comes up in March and they have a small</text>
  <text start="967.71" dur="6.33">window right now and again they are not</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="5.73">the Fed is number based and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="974.04" dur="7.92">basing all their their market</text>
  <text start="977.46" dur="7.62">manipulations on unemployment and how</text>
  <text start="981.96" dur="6.12">the stock market&amp;#39;s doing inflation on</text>
  <text start="985.08" dur="6.72">GDP and we have to remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="988.08" dur="6.15">manipulated all of these numbers so none</text>
  <text start="991.8" dur="4.29">of these numbers are true they have been</text>
  <text start="994.23" dur="4.71">changed they&amp;#39;ve been manipulated and</text>
  <text start="996.09" dur="4.95">they are using them to create the</text>
  <text start="998.94" dur="4.41">illusion that everything is recovering</text>
  <text start="1001.04" dur="4.62">and we know better that everything is</text>
  <text start="1003.35" dur="6.12">not recovering and they&amp;#39;ve said that</text>
  <text start="1005.66" dur="7.14">they are going to start the tapering</text>
  <text start="1009.47" dur="6.03">which they might even start it but we</text>
  <text start="1012.8" dur="5.7">will definitely see some type of an</text>
  <text start="1015.5" dur="5.82">event occur where they need to say whoa</text>
  <text start="1018.5" dur="5.73">whoa whoa we need to stop tapering at</text>
  <text start="1021.32" dur="7.38">this point because what happened here</text>
  <text start="1024.23" dur="7.05">just collapsed the economy and this will</text>
  <text start="1028.7" dur="5.43">be blamed on North Korea Iran Syria</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="5.46">Russia China whatever country you would</text>
  <text start="1034.13" dur="5.96">like and of course this event will bring</text>
  <text start="1036.74" dur="6.99">down the power grid lights will go out</text>
  <text start="1040.09" dur="5.62">it could be a dirty nuclear weapon it</text>
  <text start="1043.73" dur="5.58">could be a chemical weapon because we</text>
  <text start="1045.71" dur="6.57">have to remember CNN reported that Assad</text>
  <text start="1049.31" dur="5.61">has a cache of hidden chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1052.28" dur="8.6">and the UN has no knowledge of this</text>
  <text start="1054.92" dur="11.66">right now now just wasn&amp;#39;t yesterday on</text>
  <text start="1060.88" dur="10.54">CNN they had a report saying al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1066.58" dur="7.96">hints at a new terror attack in 2014 I</text>
  <text start="1071.42" dur="4.32">have the link on this report that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1074.54" dur="3.87">doing right now</text>
  <text start="1075.74" dur="5.25">which is episode 2 50 and there is a</text>
  <text start="1078.41" dur="5.34">video on this and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1080.99" dur="4.65">they they have intercepted messages and</text>
  <text start="1083.75" dur="6.27">we before I started we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1085.64" dur="7.26">that all this al-qaeda and all these</text>
  <text start="1090.02" dur="6.48">terrorists being pushed and flooded into</text>
  <text start="1092.9" dur="7.71">the country are all back by the US and</text>
  <text start="1096.5" dur="6.059">all created by the CI CIA FBI and they</text>
  <text start="1100.61" dur="4.02">they are the ones that are manipulating</text>
  <text start="1102.559" dur="3.991">what is coming and they could be getting</text>
  <text start="1104.63" dur="4.47">help from Israel and from other</text>
  <text start="1106.55" dur="4.98">countries but what this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1109.1" dur="5.579">is that there are newly intercepted</text>
  <text start="1111.53" dur="9.149">messages from senior al Qaeda operatives</text>
  <text start="1114.679" dur="9.121">and there are concerns that terrorist</text>
  <text start="1120.679" dur="8.581">attacks in the Middle East and here in</text>
  <text start="1123.8" dur="8.19">the US and 2014 could increase and this</text>
  <text start="1129.26" dur="6.33">is a Barbara Starr from CNN is reporting</text>
  <text start="1131.99" dur="6.689">this saying that new attacks active</text>
  <text start="1135.59" dur="12.65">plotting in Yemen against US and</text>
  <text start="1138.679" dur="13.081">overseas controlled us areas are in</text>
  <text start="1148.24" dur="6.49">target to new terrorist attacks us</text>
  <text start="1151.76" dur="7.5">officials very nervous about attacks in</text>
  <text start="1154.73" dur="7.89">the u.s. using commercial planes al</text>
  <text start="1159.26" dur="6.27">Qaeda has moved into Syria and getting</text>
  <text start="1162.62" dur="6.36">stronger and more dangerous these</text>
  <text start="1165.53" dur="7.59">terrorists are well trained and ready to</text>
  <text start="1168.98" dur="6.78">strike out across and into the u.s. so</text>
  <text start="1173.12" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;ve mentioned commercial planes they</text>
  <text start="1175.76" dur="6.09">mentioned Syria they are feeding and</text>
  <text start="1179.059" dur="6.12">laying the bread crumbs out here to make</text>
  <text start="1181.85" dur="7.05">everyone believe that this is coming</text>
  <text start="1185.179" dur="5.821">from overseas that they&amp;#39;re in the United</text>
  <text start="1188.9" dur="5.49">States right now they are controlled by</text>
  <text start="1191" dur="5.58">Syria they could be using airplanes they</text>
  <text start="1194.39" dur="5.58">could be hitting the power grid they</text>
  <text start="1196.58" dur="5.94">could they are they are planning new</text>
  <text start="1199.97" dur="6.449">types of attacks they are actively</text>
  <text start="1202.52" dur="6.46">plotting at this time this is all in</text>
  <text start="1206.419" dur="5.561">preparation for the next of</text>
  <text start="1208.98" dur="5.34">that we are going to see what exactly it</text>
  <text start="1211.98" dur="4.56">will be I do not know but we can make</text>
  <text start="1214.32" dur="5.52">some conclusions on what they have been</text>
  <text start="1216.54" dur="8.37">saying and everything that we see around</text>
  <text start="1219.84" dur="9.089">us and I mean we can see that something</text>
  <text start="1224.91" dur="6.6">in regards to definitely a power grid</text>
  <text start="1228.929" dur="7.021">type of attack is definitely coming we</text>
  <text start="1231.51" dur="5.85">can see that some type of chemical type</text>
  <text start="1235.95" dur="4.859">of attack will probably most likely</text>
  <text start="1237.36" dur="6.809">happen here and or it could be some type</text>
  <text start="1240.809" dur="5.101">of natural event that could occur I mean</text>
  <text start="1244.169" dur="3.421">we&amp;#39;ve been having the earthquake drill</text>
  <text start="1245.91" dur="3.84">saying that there&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="1247.59" dur="4.95">type of major earthquake happening soon</text>
  <text start="1249.75" dur="5.34">they could send set off a small nuke to</text>
  <text start="1252.54" dur="4.95">trigger it and say it was an earthquake</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="4.2">and there are so many different things</text>
  <text start="1257.49" dur="3.9">but the main thing that we need to take</text>
  <text start="1259.29" dur="3.96">away from this is that we need to be</text>
  <text start="1261.39" dur="4.71">ready and prepared because if the lights</text>
  <text start="1263.25" dur="5.309">go out and certain areas are put into</text>
  <text start="1266.1" dur="5.28">darkness you want to make sure that you</text>
  <text start="1268.559" dur="4.651">have food that you have cash that you</text>
  <text start="1271.38" dur="3.929">have extra medicine that you have water</text>

  <text start="1277.59" dur="4.829">sure that you can survive and this is</text>
  <text start="1280.11" dur="4.559">why we are this is why I&amp;#39;m doing this</text>
  <text start="1282.419" dur="5.101">and this is why we are all in this</text>
  <text start="1284.669" dur="4.861">together saying we need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="1287.52" dur="5.58">to call out the government at a moment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1289.53" dur="6.42">notice to say this was not real this was</text>
  <text start="1293.1" dur="6.209">completely planned but we are ready and</text>
