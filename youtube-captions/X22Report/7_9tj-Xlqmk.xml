  <text start="43.73" dur="5.399">treated as critical infrastructure</text>
  <text start="45.2" dur="6.06">during a cyberattack let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="49.129" dur="4.741">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="51.26" dur="6.33">geopolitical news now a couple reports</text>
  <text start="53.87" dur="6.03">ago we talked about GMO foods and Obama</text>
  <text start="57.59" dur="4.32">signed the legislation that requires</text>
  <text start="59.9" dur="3.99">manufacturers of genetically modified</text>
  <text start="61.91" dur="3.12">food to provide labeling of their</text>
  <text start="63.89" dur="4.92">products and we talked about all the</text>
  <text start="65.03" dur="8.85">different problems of this bill s 7 64</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="8.82">and once again we as a people we have a</text>
  <text start="73.88" dur="6">right to know what is in the food what</text>
  <text start="77.63" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;re putting into our bodies is it safe</text>
  <text start="79.88" dur="6.93">for us we&amp;#39;re adults we can make the</text>
  <text start="83.78" dur="4.199">decision what is good and what is not</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="4.88">good but this is not what it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="87.979" dur="8.851">it&amp;#39;s about keeping certain corporations</text>
  <text start="91.69" dur="7.989">in business making a profit and hiding</text>
  <text start="96.83" dur="6.48">the facts from the people that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="99.679" dur="6.78">what it&amp;#39;s all about and also there are</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="7.83">other agendas infertility poisoning</text>
  <text start="106.459" dur="6.66">keeping us obese and other things but</text>
  <text start="111.14" dur="4.8">there are problems with this and we know</text>
  <text start="113.119" dur="6.571">that this bill is not going to require</text>
  <text start="115.94" dur="6.569">the manufacturers to put a text type of</text>
  <text start="119.69" dur="5.129">form of labeling on the products they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="122.509" dur="5.581">have to use like maybe a QR code or</text>
  <text start="124.819" dur="6.211">something like that another problem with</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="5.58">the bill is its lack standards of broad</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="4.47">definitions for example the bill</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="5.069">stipulates that if majority of products</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="6.989">contain meat it need not be labeled as</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="6.931">containing GM ingredients very</text>
  <text start="142.489" dur="6.391">interesting now the two lawmakers who</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="7.35">crafted the bill debbie Stabenow and Pat</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="7.68">Roberts they are direct beneficiaries of</text>
  <text start="153.02" dur="6.27">lobbyists Stabenow is six largest donor</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="7.319">in 2016 was dow chemical which</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="5.61">coincidentally lobbied for s-76 for</text>
  <text start="163.879" dur="3.671">passage</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="5.08">stabenow is other donors include Morgan</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="5.43">Stanley Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="6.24">Company Stabenow accepted more money</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="6.77">from agribusiness political action</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="8.76">committees in 2016 then from any other</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="7.99">industry packs so you can see right now</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="7.35">that these individuals they are in the</text>
  <text start="187.74" dur="6.45">pockets of these corporations and this</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="5.67">is something that we really need to</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="7.02">change in America these lobbyists what</text>
  <text start="198" dur="6.12">the senators representatives can accept</text>
  <text start="201.21" dur="6.87">they should not be allowed to accept any</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="8.67">money from central banks from</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="10.61">corporations or anything like that to</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="9.66">fund their campaign each individual</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="9.4">should be blocked from accepting any</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="8.75">type of funds because once our</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="8.55">representatives are president our</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="9.88">senators once they take the funds the</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="7.8">corporation&amp;#39;s those individuals they</text>
  <text start="241.08" dur="8.82">have them and once that individual is</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="8.579">elected into office guess what those</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="6.45">corporations they come running and</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="7.321">saying okay you owe us now we have these</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="8.19">laws that we&amp;#39;ve written up and we want</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="7.62">you to back them and this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="8.36">benefit the people it benefits the</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="8.22">corporation&amp;#39;s once again and all of this</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="8.89">should not be in our government the</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="8.88">government is there to support the</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="6.6">people to do everything in their best</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="7.08">interest for the people what the people</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="7.22">want and what corporations want and what</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="6.12">people want are two different things and</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="4.12">we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="6.03">our government right now is completely</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="7.32">corrupt at this point they all need to</text>
  <text start="304.29" dur="5.07">be removed and replaced now the</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="5.4">situation in Ukraine has gone from bad</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.67">to worse we see the Organization for</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.26">Security and Cooperation in Europe said</text>
  <text start="315.03" dur="5.97">that one of its monitors were threatened</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="10.02">at gunpoint in eastern Ukraine and this</text>
  <text start="321" dur="8.34">was at a Kiev checkpoint and the special</text>
  <text start="326.73" dur="5.61">monitoring mission they were stopped by</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="7.2">armed man military style clothing with</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="7.8">no markings at a known Ukrainian army</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="5.4">position and one of the smm monitors</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="5.04">step down to the vehicle to speak with</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="5.13">the man and the individual that was</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="5.72">dressed in military solid clothing</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="7.23">chambered a round into his machine gun</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="8.47">put his finger on the trigger and it</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="6.87">told this group to leave this area now</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s apparent they don&amp;#39;t want them to</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="5.64">see what&amp;#39;s going on in certain areas</text>
  <text start="363.51" dur="7.95">near the contact line and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="8.06">seeing right now is that Kiev they</text>
  <text start="371.46" dur="6.66">reject negotiations with Dom bass</text>
  <text start="374.87" dur="6.43">altogether and it looks like right now</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="5.01">that the political dialogue as part of</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.56">the Minsk negotiation is actually</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="6.6">blocked by the Ukrainian side which we</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="6.09">knew for a very long time there no</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="3.65">there&amp;#39;s no law on the special status on</text>
  <text start="391.95" dur="4.68">the constitutional reform on the</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="5.59">elections and on the amnesty of the</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="6.57">southeastern people and it does look</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="8.97">like right now that all of this is off</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="6.99">the table and it looks like Ukraine will</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="4.17">be going to war once again and this is a</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="4.74">situation we need to watch and if we</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="6.12">really think about it the United States</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="5.55">right now is bombing many of the</text>
  <text start="418.23" dur="4.59">countries in the Middle East they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="5.19">getting ready to start war in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="6.42">and they&amp;#39;re provoking North Korea China</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="6.12">in the South Pacific they are really</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="7.83">pushing the idea for war</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="8.04">at this point we see the UN member</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="4.95">states they have rejected a un proposal</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="4.98">to resettle ten percent of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="4.38">refugees annually as part of a new</text>
  <text start="444.81" dur="4.5">global effort to tackle the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.4" dur="7.77">worst refugee crisis since world war two</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="7.91">and all of this was created by the</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="6.21">United States and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="457.22" dur="5.53">because look do you think the people in</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="3.93">Libya with the US now bombing in there</text>
  <text start="462.75" dur="4.98">of course France is going to join in</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="6.3">later on UK will join in NATO eventually</text>
  <text start="467.73" dur="5.28">will arrive do you think the people are</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="5.04">going to stay in this country most</text>
  <text start="473.01" dur="4.89">likely not they&amp;#39;re going to leave who</text>
  <text start="475.65" dur="3.78">wants to stay in an area where there is</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.02">constant more and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="5.1">seeing in Iraq this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="481.92" dur="6.87">in Syria this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="6.9">Lebanon Sudan Yemen Libya where is the</text>
  <text start="488.79" dur="7.44">United States in each one of these</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="9.72">countries causing chaos and more for</text>
  <text start="496.23" dur="7.77">what to prop up the petro dollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="4.2">it that&amp;#39;s the reason we&amp;#39;re in all of</text>
  <text start="504" dur="3.54">these areas and this is the reason why</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re continually trying to move into</text>
  <text start="507.54" dur="7.74">more and more countries but as we can</text>
  <text start="510.93" dur="7.68">see the US is losing control very very</text>
  <text start="515.28" dur="6.54">quickly we see the US Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="7.35">John Kerry well he&amp;#39;s going to be making</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="7.94">a stop in Turkey in late August to</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="7.32">discuss what happened with the coup and</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="4.93">talked to Irwin about what happened with</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="3.69">the coup and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch that</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="5.16">situation very carefully turkey right</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="7.26">now they issued a formal arrest warrant</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="8.85">for Glenn and it came out of the</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="6.87">istanbul-based court and right now the</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="6.03">United States is not handing him over</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re keeping him and I know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="554.73" dur="4.62">know if the United States at this point</text>
  <text start="556.08" dur="7.11">will actually hand Glenn over to turkey</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="6.33">because the goal in Turkey is to remove</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="5.94">her one at this point as we can see</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="7.26">and the goal in the Middle East is to</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="5.49">start a war so I think this is the</text>
  <text start="572.94" dur="3.78">furthest from their agenda right now and</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="4.8">I believe right now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="5.94">continually push their agenda in this</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="7.8">entire region and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="582.66" dur="6.81">u.s. they are bombing in Libya now Obama</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="5.4">says they&amp;#39;re going to be bombing in this</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="8.09">area for 30 days so at the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="592.62" dur="9.69">press briefing on Monday Nancy Yosef</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="9.93">asked the question what gives you the</text>
  <text start="602.31" dur="9.839">authorization to go into Libya and cook</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="7.08">responded that they&amp;#39;re still using the</text>
  <text start="612.149" dur="8.011">authorization for use of military force</text>
  <text start="614.57" dur="9.67">which was passed during 911 so it&amp;#39;s 15</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="7.2">years old right now and when you look at</text>
  <text start="624.24" dur="5.55">the AUMF resolution it authorizes the</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="5.97">United States to go into countries where</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="5.52">al-qaeda is and to fight them not the</text>
  <text start="633.33" dur="6.27">Islamic state and this is what the</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="8.1">United States is doing in Libya and it</text>
  <text start="639.6" dur="5.79">really doesn&amp;#39;t pertain to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="4.049">state now we know there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.889">authorization for war pending in</text>
  <text start="647.459" dur="4.951">Congress where they can go after</text>
  <text start="650.279" dur="3.901">al-qaeda the Islamic state Boko Haram or</text>
  <text start="652.41" dur="3.51">any other terrorist group that is not</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="4.29">named in the document but they never got</text>
  <text start="655.92" dur="5.43">any traction so they&amp;#39;re using this old</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="7.59">one right now and the old Wars power</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="9.54">resolution allows the President to go in</text>
  <text start="666.06" dur="10.17">and bomb or do whatever he has to do for</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="10.08">a hundred and eighty days and we can see</text>
  <text start="676.23" dur="8.79">in Syria well 180 days have passed in</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="7.14">Iraq 180 days have passed congress</text>
  <text start="685.02" dur="7.11">hasn&amp;#39;t voted on anything the president</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="5.669">is just doing whatever he wants and if</text>
  <text start="692.13" dur="5.399">we think the bombing is going to end in</text>
  <text start="693.779" dur="5.341">30 days there&amp;#39;s no way because they need</text>
  <text start="697.529" dur="1.921">to take control of the Middle East</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="699.45" dur="5.16">lost control of the Middle East Ashton</text>
  <text start="701.76" dur="5.85">Carter even a minute is he told troops</text>
  <text start="704.61" dur="6.21">at Fort Bragg we will be going into each</text>
  <text start="707.61" dur="5.76">in every one of these countries to take</text>
  <text start="710.82" dur="6.84">back control and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="713.37" dur="9.3">seeing right now and this is not going</text>
  <text start="717.66" dur="6.42">to end this is going to escalate as we</text>
  <text start="722.67" dur="4.47">move throughout the month of August</text>
  <text start="724.08" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re going to see more bombings we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.14" dur="4.68">going to see war heat up we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="728.82" dur="5.85">see more troops head over to the Middle</text>
  <text start="731.82" dur="5.25">East you&amp;#39;ll hear announcements coming</text>
  <text start="734.67" dur="5.4">from the White House that we need to</text>
  <text start="737.07" dur="6.12">send more advisers now to Libya we need</text>
  <text start="740.07" dur="8.45">a special ops team inside of Libya to</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="10.08">help out and this will continue on</text>
  <text start="748.52" dur="7.09">because what they want is war down and</text>
  <text start="753.27" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to get it either they</text>
  <text start="755.61" dur="4.95">take control of the entire situation</text>
  <text start="757.05" dur="5.97">where we go to war and at the same time</text>
  <text start="760.56" dur="5.55">while trying to take over the entire</text>
  <text start="763.02" dur="7.29">Middle East war is going to come out of</text>
  <text start="766.11" dur="7.14">this now out in Syria we can see that</text>
  <text start="770.31" dur="5.01">the propaganda is all over the place and</text>
  <text start="773.25" dur="3.51">we can see that they&amp;#39;re mentioning</text>
  <text start="775.32" dur="5.85">chemical weapons they&amp;#39;re mentioning</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="10.92">napalm but here are some facts that we</text>
  <text start="781.17" dur="8.82">need to remember President Assad he has</text>
  <text start="787.68" dur="5.67">a higher approval rating than Barack</text>
  <text start="789.99" dur="5.91">Obama the people in his country see him</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="5.94">as a war hero he brought in Russia</text>
  <text start="795.9" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re removing the terrorists and we</text>
  <text start="799.29" dur="3.75">have to remember the United States they</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t have permission to be inside Syria</text>
  <text start="803.04" dur="5.34">Assad has never used chemical weapons on</text>
  <text start="805.77" dur="4.17">his own people a UN investigation into</text>
  <text start="808.38" dur="6.2">the first major chemical weapons attack</text>
  <text start="809.94" dur="9.3">committed an early of 2013 concluded</text>

  <text start="1107.86" dur="5.22">whatsoever but told everyone they had</text>

  <text start="1125.83" dur="6.75">of months ago John Kerry came out and</text>
  <text start="1128.95" dur="5.85">said that the US the moderate rebels</text>

  <text start="1139.15" dur="10.26">August and we&amp;#39;re actually seeing this</text>
  <text start="1145.02" dur="6.82">because august first exactly the same</text>
  <text start="1149.41" dur="6.27">day Kerry had set starting date for the</text>
  <text start="1151.84" dur="6.42">very different track the US had prepared</text>
  <text start="1155.68" dur="5.16">for an escalation and extension of the</text>
  <text start="1158.26" dur="4.83">war on Syria in December and January</text>
  <text start="1160.84" dur="5.22">ships under US controls transported at</text>

  <text start="1191.62" dur="6.87">north of the city and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1195.34" dur="7.17">planning this for months so carries very</text>
  <text start="1198.49" dur="8.93">different track fits right into what is</text>
  <text start="1202.51" dur="8.28">going on right now and the attack</text>
  <text start="1207.42" dur="9.4">started on Sunday and by Monday the</text>
  <text start="1210.79" dur="8.94">second we see that the attack failed the</text>
  <text start="1216.82" dur="6.38">plan did not work out in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="1219.73" dur="7.65">whatsoever they failed to achieve</text>
  <text start="1223.2" dur="7.45">desired aim now most likely the coup was</text>
  <text start="1227.38" dur="5.16">supposed to get her to one out of power</text>
  <text start="1230.65" dur="3.629">they were going to be able to have the</text>
  <text start="1232.54" dur="4.859">forces in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1234.279" dur="4.86">maybe come down from that direction but</text>
  <text start="1237.399" dur="5.671">the whole thing was completely messed up</text>
  <text start="1239.139" dur="6.09">and we can see right now what has</text>
  <text start="1243.07" dur="5.699">happened since August first they tried</text>
  <text start="1245.229" dur="6.3">this attack in Syria in Aleppo it</text>
  <text start="1248.769" dur="9.72">completely failed they&amp;#39;re bombing now in</text>
  <text start="1251.529" dur="9.061">Libya and were not even done yet most</text>
  <text start="1258.489" dur="7.14">likely they&amp;#39;re going to be going to plan</text>
  <text start="1260.59" dur="8.519">what are they on plan Z now and as the</text>
  <text start="1265.629" dur="4.65">US continually loses because you have to</text>
  <text start="1269.109" dur="5.101">remember the United States government</text>
  <text start="1270.279" dur="6.99">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not gods most of</text>
  <text start="1274.21" dur="5.879">them are imbeciles every plan they have</text>
  <text start="1277.269" dur="7.02">seems not to work out or Putin is one</text>
  <text start="1280.089" dur="5.88">step ahead of them so what happens to</text>
  <text start="1284.289" dur="3.93">these individuals that don&amp;#39;t get their</text>
  <text start="1285.969" dur="4.981">way well they&amp;#39;re going to stamp their</text>
  <text start="1288.219" dur="5.19">feet they&amp;#39;re going to slam their fists</text>
  <text start="1290.95" dur="7.289">down and they&amp;#39;re going to do something</text>
  <text start="1293.409" dur="7.5">stupid and the stupid thing is is some</text>
  <text start="1298.239" dur="5.701">type of an event they will go that route</text>
  <text start="1300.909" dur="6.48">they will go to that extreme to get</text>
  <text start="1303.94" dur="7.799">their way if it ends up and more they</text>
  <text start="1307.389" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t care so what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1311.739" dur="6.3">seeing the economy deteriorate and</text>
  <text start="1314.379" dur="6.27">collapse we&amp;#39;re seeing provocations in</text>
  <text start="1318.039" dur="6.93">the South Pacific against North Korea</text>
  <text start="1320.649" dur="9.9">and China we see Ukraine heading towards</text>
  <text start="1324.969" dur="7.08">war NATO provoking Russia we see the</text>
  <text start="1330.549" dur="3.54">Middle East the United States is all</text>
  <text start="1332.049" dur="4.74">over the place bombing everyone troops</text>
  <text start="1334.089" dur="5.67">everywhere and then we have the</text>
  <text start="1336.789" dur="5.7">elections the elections coming up this</text>
  <text start="1339.759" dur="6.39">November and we know there&amp;#39;s a candidate</text>
  <text start="1342.489" dur="5.221">that the u.s. government the central</text>
  <text start="1346.149" dur="5.76">bankers the shadow government they all</text>
  <text start="1347.71" dur="6.179">want and there&amp;#39;s another candidate where</text>
  <text start="1351.909" dur="8.19">they just want to get rid of that person</text>
  <text start="1353.889" dur="8.85">and we understand something might occur</text>
  <text start="1360.099" dur="6.06">during this time if it&amp;#39;s not going their</text>
  <text start="1362.739" dur="4.401">way now we talked about some type of an</text>
  <text start="1366.159" dur="4.101">event</text>
  <text start="1367.14" dur="8.25">just a couple reports ago we talked</text>
  <text start="1370.26" dur="7.68">about the new six schema alert system</text>
  <text start="1375.39" dur="3.99">that the US government is going to use</text>
  <text start="1377.94" dur="4.85">and what they consider critical</text>
  <text start="1379.38" dur="7.35">infrastructure and they laid it out</text>
  <text start="1382.79" dur="7.63">because we can expect a cyberattack but</text>
  <text start="1386.73" dur="6.99">very interestingly they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1390.42" dur="5.61">include the election systems they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1393.72" dur="4.95">going to be treated as critical</text>
  <text start="1396.03" dur="6.96">infrastructure so if there is a</text>
  <text start="1398.67" dur="7.26">cyberattack on the election the</text>
  <text start="1402.99" dur="4.32">electronic election systems which they</text>
  <text start="1405.93" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t even have to prove by the way</text>
  <text start="1407.31" dur="8.37">it&amp;#39;ll just tell everyone there is they</text>
  <text start="1411.42" dur="8.04">will look at how bad it&amp;#39;s hit what level</text>
  <text start="1415.68" dur="7.98">we&amp;#39;re at and that might even postpone</text>
  <text start="1419.46" dur="8.19">the election so what do we have here we</text>
  <text start="1423.66" dur="6.6">have the election systems included with</text>
  <text start="1427.65" dur="5.43">the critical infrastructure they can use</text>
  <text start="1430.26" dur="6.08">this to postpone the elections actually</text>
  <text start="1433.08" dur="9.27">they can declare a state of emergency</text>
  <text start="1436.34" dur="9.19">with this we also have maybe the Zika</text>
  <text start="1442.35" dur="6.24">virus where they can say okay we have an</text>
  <text start="1445.53" dur="4.95">outbreak here it&amp;#39;s we can&amp;#39;t get this</text>
  <text start="1448.59" dur="3.03">under control cdc you can come up with</text>
  <text start="1450.48" dur="2.94">their models saying millions of people</text>
  <text start="1451.62" dur="3">are infected this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1453.42" dur="3.93">happen we have to vaccinate everyone</text>
  <text start="1454.62" dur="5.22">there has to be total lockdown they can</text>
  <text start="1457.35" dur="6.72">go that route or there could be some</text>
  <text start="1459.84" dur="7.05">type of physical attack and even if none</text>
  <text start="1464.07" dur="4.08">of this happens let&amp;#39;s say because they</text>
  <text start="1466.89" dur="2.76">think they have it under control they</text>
  <text start="1468.15" dur="3.87">think they have the person they want and</text>
  <text start="1469.65" dur="4.55">the other person gets into office and</text>
  <text start="1472.02" dur="5.49">you know who I&amp;#39;m talking about Trump</text>
  <text start="1474.2" dur="7.42">most likely something will happen at</text>
  <text start="1477.51" dur="7.44">that point so this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1481.62" dur="6.33">watching here because as we can see from</text>
  <text start="1484.95" dur="5.76">the indicators that we see what is</text>
  <text start="1487.95" dur="6.27">happening in the Middle East now this is</text>
  <text start="1490.71" dur="6.57">like a perfect storm coming all together</text>
  <text start="1494.22" dur="6.12">and it is going to be a complete and</text>
  <text start="1497.28" dur="6.09">utter disaster it will not cover</text>
  <text start="1500.34" dur="5.67">up it will not stop I should say the</text>
  <text start="1503.37" dur="4.7">economic collapse it will just make</text>
  <text start="1506.01" dur="4.64">everyone look in a different direction</text>
  <text start="1508.07" dur="6.239">but everything that&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="1510.65" dur="7">because the economy cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="1514.309" dur="6.521">they want to go to war they want people</text>

  <text start="1530.46" dur="8.16">losses they take the gains they want</text>
  <text start="1534.33" dur="7.67">rules for the everyday person and no</text>
  <text start="1538.62" dur="6.929">rules for them they love this country of</text>
  <text start="1542" dur="7.71">course they do because they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="1545.549" dur="8.791">on a completely different playing field</text>
