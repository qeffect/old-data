  <text start="128.3" dur="7.68">a total number of 300 stores and this is</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="7.14">continuing throughout the retail matrix</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="7.56">here and what&amp;#39;s happening is that all</text>
  <text start="139.3" dur="7.95">retail is contracting right now we see</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="7.23">from reports coming in the retail sector</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re not any better than any other</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="4.29">sector here in the US and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="152.99" dur="3.09">looking at other sectors here in the US</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at housing the auto</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="5.07">industry and all of this is declining</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="3.27">right now they are showing that a total</text>
  <text start="163.22" dur="4.59">earnings for the</text>
  <text start="164" dur="7.67">496 SP 500 members have reported results</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="6.32">and they are down negative 6.1 percent</text>
  <text start="171.67" dur="4.87">so what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="6.06">everything is completely contracting</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="8.61">declining falling apart the economy is</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="7.48">continually doing a lot worse and as we</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="5.07">go through this entire year it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="4.59">to get worse and worse even though the</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="4.17">president is out there patting himself</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.41">on the back that we manipulated all</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="3.9">these numbers look how great the</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="3.48">economy&amp;#39;s doing and people are actually</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="4.199">believing us and he&amp;#39;s patting himself on</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="5.07">the back showing all of this off and</text>
  <text start="202.489" dur="4.831">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that all of</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="3.45">this is going to crash now remember they</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for this because</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.17">think about it all this time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.71">been telling us has how great this has</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="6">been how fantastic the economy&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="215.57" dur="5.43">doing and they can have it go down on</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="5.07">their watch they need to blame this on</text>
  <text start="221" dur="4.98">another group and or another country and</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="5.67">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="6.69">now we see that they&amp;#39;re still pushing a</text>
  <text start="229.58" dur="4.89">cashless society Sweden right now has</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="3.599">begun their five-year countdown until</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="4.26">eliminates all cash and we know they</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="4.711">want to do this completely but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="5.819">very interesting about what has been</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="8.67">going on all around the world is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.549" dur="8.491">trying to sustain this huge debt bubble</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="5.429">now it has grown very very large it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="4.77">getting worse and worse it cannot be</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="5.431">sustained and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="5.669">realize this they understand that as</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="4.86">they go forward it just can&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="3.121">this is why Christine Lagarde was out</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="5.37">there saying it would be great if we had</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="7.379">a 10% wealth tax 10% wealth tax not to</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="5.82">pay down the debt but just to let us</text>
  <text start="273.979" dur="4.531">continually keep moving forward because</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="3.27">they really don&amp;#39;t want all the debt paid</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="4.56">off which is completely impossible</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="5.58">anyhow but they just want to lower it so</text>
  <text start="283.07" dur="4.53">they can continue and move forward and</text>
  <text start="285.41" dur="4.17">prop the system up for a little bit</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="5.819">longer until they get everything in</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="6.12">place to bring it down and we see that</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="3.391">they were trying a carbon tax to tax the</text>
  <text start="295.7" dur="2.13">people and this is what happens during</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.11">this time they</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="6.69">add more taxes so the next part of their</text>
  <text start="300.92" dur="5.64">strategy is to basically extend the</text>
  <text start="304.52" dur="4.89">retirement ages so if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="306.56" dur="4.68">retire in 65 you won&amp;#39;t be able to retire</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="3.36">if you want to retire in 70 you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="3.06">able to retire we don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="3.18">age will be but we know they want to</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="3.6">move it up and the reason they want to</text>
  <text start="315.95" dur="5.01">do this is because they can tax you</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="6.27">longer and you have a shorter period of</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.37">time in receiving those benefits think</text>
  <text start="324.17" dur="6.96">about what they&amp;#39;re doing now in Europe</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="9.06">we know that these refugees have been</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.34">let loose into Europe from Turkey now</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s many different agendas</text>
  <text start="336.47" dur="4.68">associated with this we know at this</text>
  <text start="338.69" dur="4.65">point they want to shut down the borders</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="4.82">they want to get rid of Schengen why</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="6.9">because they don&amp;#39;t want movement of</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="6.73">capital they want it contained in each</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="4.08">one of these countries and we can see</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="2.66">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="354.32" dur="3.99">do at this point</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="5.26">so Lagarde is trying to alter the</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="5.69">pension system by extending the</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="8.01">productive life of each individual and</text>
  <text start="364" dur="6.1">this will allow them to prop the system</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="3.86">up because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re desperate at</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="6.39">this point they are looking everywhere</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="6.88">to bring in more revenue to keep this</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="5.28">system alive just a little longer until</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="4.73">they can bring it down themselves and of</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="6.21">course start a war to cover it all up</text>
  <text start="384.1" dur="5.68">now out in Japan we see things are</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="4.2">heating up there the people the governor</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="4.35">of Okinawa they are speaking out there</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.17">having protests and they&amp;#39;re saying we do</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="3.87">not want this base here whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="396.35" dur="3.6">the u.s. came out saying we&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="398" dur="4.14">delayed but we&amp;#39;re moving forward of</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="5.43">course they&amp;#39;re not going to stop well</text>
  <text start="402.14" dur="6.48">the Japanese premier Abbaye he said okay</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re not going to build in Okinawa</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re going to suspend the construction</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="6">there is so much pressure on him that he</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="6.06">says we&amp;#39;re going to look to move the</text>
  <text start="416.72" dur="5.85">base to a different location where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.75" dur="4.53">not so populated so does this mean the</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="3.15">base is not going to be built no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="3.63">just not going to be built in that area</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re going to move it to a different</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="5.75">area so the people hunker down they</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="3.81">pushed and they said we do not want it</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="3.539">here now of course all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="3.93">picking a different location and of</text>
  <text start="437.199" dur="3.811">course they they need this base because</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="4.97">they need it bigger larger more advanced</text>
  <text start="441.01" dur="7.02">to bring in more advanced weaponry to</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="6.46">fight China to fight Russia once war</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="5.49">breaks out you know out in Kiev we see</text>
  <text start="450.79" dur="5.01">Kiev is continually shelling the lagoons</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="2.73">area if they&amp;#39;ve done this in the last 24</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="2.85">hours</text>
  <text start="456.25" dur="4.979">and they&amp;#39;re continually doing this and</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="5.7">actually this is increasing in intensity</text>
  <text start="461.229" dur="6.541">in this area because we know the Kiev</text>
  <text start="464.35" dur="5.789">government they are pushing at this</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="3.69">point to start a major offensive they</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="3.301">don&amp;#39;t want to complete the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="5.429">ceasefire agreement Russia&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="5.28">pressure on Kiev the u.s. Kiev and the</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="4.741">European nations are putting pressure on</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="4.83">Russia so we can see at this point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="4.44">at a deadlock right now because we know</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="5.07">Kiev the US government they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="486.07" dur="5.7">to fulfill this whatsoever now out in</text>
  <text start="488.62" dur="4.859">Saudi Arabia things are deteriorating</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="4.89">very very quickly the financial</text>
  <text start="493.479" dur="5.431">situation is a huge problem in the Saudi</text>
  <text start="496.66" dur="5.03">Kingdom much of their budget has been</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="5.79">burned up from that war in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re losing badly in this area a lot</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="5.16">of their black water mercenaries they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="4.14">been killed in missile attacks last</text>

  <text start="520.719" dur="6.421">hundred Saudi soldiers Saudi Arabia has</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="5.76">a water crisis and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="5.19">right now is they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="5.52">entire situation the kingdom is falling</text>
  <text start="532.33" dur="6.03">apart financial situation is hurt</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="4.89">because of the low oil prices and now</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="5.72">they&amp;#39;re starting to tax water for the</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="7.14">first time to bring in more revenue and</text>
  <text start="544.08" dur="7.3">they need this war to go forward in</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="8.37">Syria they need Assad removed they need</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="6.66">the u.s. to come in and help out to</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="3.93">remove these elected governments and put</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="3.15">back the puppet governments so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="3.06">gonna have to watch as a situation very</text>
  <text start="561.19" dur="3.36">very closely to see what&amp;#39;s going on as</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="3.09">we move forward here because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="3.85">going to become desperate</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="4.93">turkey is continually shelling into</text>
  <text start="568.4" dur="4.02">Syria they have not stopped they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="3.15">keeping the corridor open of course</text>
  <text start="572.42" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re bombing the Kurds</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re bombing the Islamic state and we</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="3.42">know this is not really what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="3.75">doing now Turkish activities in the</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="6.54">region they&amp;#39;re undermining the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="7.38">and this is basically their job this is</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="8.91">what the US wants them to do because the</text>
  <text start="588.92" dur="10.14">u.s. right now they&amp;#39;re pushing a new</text>
  <text start="594.77" dur="8.13">plan in this area they know they are</text>
  <text start="599.06" dur="5.82">beat because Russia has been bombing the</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="5.4">Islamic state because we know in the</text>
  <text start="604.88" dur="4.89">past the US was not bombing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="608.3" dur="4.23">state because it is their proxy or me</text>
  <text start="609.77" dur="5.91">this is why Obama was calling out the</text>
  <text start="612.53" dur="4.56">targets there were specific targets</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="3.78">which were not the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="6.27">were the infrastructure of Syria and</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="5.45">Iraq and we can see right now what</text>
  <text start="623.36" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re doing but very interestingly</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="7.21">there was a report that was leaked from</text>
  <text start="627.38" dur="8.04">NATO and they basically said okay look</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="7.31">Russia is really hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="8.52">state and they&amp;#39;ve done this with fewer</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="7.44">bombing runs fewer warplanes compared to</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="5.52">the coalition forces now I know the</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="4.51">corporate media the US government the</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="2.76">propaganda is out there they tell a</text>
  <text start="651.38" dur="3">different story</text>
  <text start="652.22" dur="3.45">even NATO tells a different story but</text>
  <text start="654.38" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re watching the situation very</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="7.26">closely and this leaked report that came</text>
  <text start="658.85" dur="5.88">out shows that Russia is actually doing</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="3.72">the work because when we look at this</text>
  <text start="664.73" dur="4.44">the document points out that Russia</text>
  <text start="666.65" dur="7.11">deployed about 40 warplanes performing</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="6.33">about 75 sorties and the US and the</text>
  <text start="673.76" dur="4.11">coalition forces deployed about a</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="5.85">hundred and eighty warplanes against the</text>
  <text start="677.87" dur="6.27">Islamic state and they were hitting 20</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="5.22">targets a day now we know most of these</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="4.32">targets almost all of them we&amp;#39;re not the</text>
  <text start="686.57" dur="4.71">Islamic state this is why we see the</text>
  <text start="688.46" dur="5.28">discrepancy right now and the US and the</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="5.19">coalition forces they know they&amp;#39;re beat</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="4.71">right now they know the plan they once</text>
  <text start="696.47" dur="2.58">had is not going to work this is why</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="1.889">Carter was</text>
  <text start="699.05" dur="3.9">going around to all these different</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="4.981">countries during this ceasefire period</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="5.31">asking countries to bring in more</text>
  <text start="705.32" dur="4.38">military assets more troops to fight the</text>
  <text start="708.26" dur="5.22">Islamic state which makes no sense at</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="7.41">this point because Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="713.48" dur="6.81">armed forces have been doing the job now</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="4.53">why all of a sudden does the US and the</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="3.6">rest of the coalition forces need to</text>
  <text start="721.64" dur="4.35">bring in more into this territory when</text>
  <text start="723.89" dur="3.629">they couldn&amp;#39;t do it for the last year</text>
  <text start="725.99" dur="3.9">well we know the real reason because</text>
  <text start="727.519" dur="5.491">they weren&amp;#39;t really doing it so are they</text>
  <text start="729.89" dur="5.819">gonna really do it this time no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="733.01" dur="5.31">going after Assad they&amp;#39;re making plans</text>
  <text start="735.709" dur="3.471">they&amp;#39;re using this as a cover story at</text>
  <text start="738.32" dur="3.42">this point</text>
  <text start="739.18" dur="4.779">and they know the Islamic state is beat</text>
  <text start="741.74" dur="6.24">at this time now we understand that</text>
  <text start="743.959" dur="7.261">Syria is going to call for elections but</text>
  <text start="747.98" dur="5.49">Saudi Arabia is saying listen before the</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.859">elections before the transitional</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="4.619">government and they keep using these</text>
  <text start="756.079" dur="4.471">terms that it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="758.089" dur="3.841">transitional government now most likely</text>
  <text start="760.55" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re going to try to force this of</text>
  <text start="761.93" dur="5.04">course but they want Assad to step down</text>
  <text start="764.42" dur="4.08">before the elections now why would they</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="5.54">want him to do this at this point</text>
  <text start="768.5" dur="6.329">because they know he will be a reelected</text>
  <text start="772.51" dur="4.42">this is what they&amp;#39;re nervous about and</text>
  <text start="774.829" dur="5.461">we know the elections are coming up next</text>
  <text start="776.93" dur="6.149">month we know they&amp;#39;re gonna try to get</text>
  <text start="780.29" dur="4.14">rid of them and fix elections they&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="783.079" dur="3.841">whatever they have to to try to get rid</text>
  <text start="784.43" dur="5.64">of them but we see very interesting</text>
  <text start="786.92" dur="6.419">things happening during this period of</text>
  <text start="790.07" dur="5.55">time like we said we&amp;#39;ve seen military</text>
  <text start="793.339" dur="3.601">assets coming in we&amp;#39;ve seen troops from</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="5.279">many different countries coming in</text>
  <text start="796.94" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;ve found weapons on a Turkish</text>
  <text start="800.899" dur="4.56">freighter</text>
  <text start="801.529" dur="7.321">they found uniforms in Spain and now we</text>
  <text start="805.459" dur="7.07">see the Syrian army in sweida Syria on</text>
  <text start="808.85" dur="8.989">the border of Jordan the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="812.529" dur="9.161">confiscated a huge amount of weapons</text>
  <text start="817.839" dur="6.75">destined for the Islamic state and they</text>
  <text start="821.69" dur="6.69">were Israeli weapons and us-made weapons</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="8.261">they included 20 RPG shells landmines 90</text>
  <text start="828.38" dur="7.889">anti-tank missiles bks machine gun boxes</text>
  <text start="832.85" dur="5.929">and other ammunition so we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.269" dur="5.671">still supplying the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="838.779" dur="4.87">they realize as Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="841.94" dur="4.019">Armed Forces continues their bombing in</text>
  <text start="843.649" dur="4.021">the area against the Islamic state not</text>
  <text start="845.959" dur="3.451">the rebel forces now think about this</text>
  <text start="847.67" dur="6.359">for a second they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="6">hitting the moderate rebels at this</text>
  <text start="854.029" dur="3.601">point they&amp;#39;re going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="855.41" dur="4.409">state so what the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="857.63" dur="5.519">forces are doing at this point is</text>
  <text start="859.819" dur="6.95">they&amp;#39;re having the moderate rebels take</text>
  <text start="863.149" dur="9.271">over the areas where the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="866.769" dur="8.351">were so the Syrian rebel fighters they</text>
  <text start="872.42" dur="5.609">have now seized border crossings with</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="5.579">Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="6.151">this way the Russian forces the Syrian</text>
  <text start="880.699" dur="5.971">the Syrian Armed Forces will not attack</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="6.029">that area and the US can keep that under</text>
  <text start="886.67" dur="5.729">their control so we see right now the</text>
  <text start="890.209" dur="4.531">Islamic state had controlled the Alton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.399" dur="4.201">border crossing and now the moderate</text>
  <text start="894.74" dur="4.289">rebels they&amp;#39;ve taken that over and we</text>
  <text start="896.6" dur="5.609">see this occurring all throughout Syria</text>
  <text start="899.029" dur="5.87">in different areas now the u.s. is going</text>
  <text start="902.209" dur="10.021">to be using the b-52 stratofortress</text>
  <text start="904.899" dur="10.36">bombers in the campaign to fight the</text>
  <text start="912.23" dur="5.849">Islamic state in Syria this is what</text>
  <text start="915.259" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone now is this</text>
  <text start="918.079" dur="4.86">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing why all of a</text>
  <text start="920.48" dur="5.25">sudden if the Islamic state is beaten</text>
  <text start="922.939" dur="7.59">all these towns and cities are liberated</text>
  <text start="925.73" dur="10.32">Russia has been doing this since what is</text>
  <text start="930.529" dur="8.101">it four five six months now why does the</text>
  <text start="936.05" dur="6.45">US and the coalition forces need to ramp</text>
  <text start="938.63" dur="7.17">things up they don&amp;#39;t not for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="942.5" dur="5.67">state they need to ramp things up for</text>
  <text start="945.8" dur="6.889">the next plan so now they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="948.17" dur="8.82">more advanced weaponry like two b-52</text>
  <text start="952.689" dur="7.481">because they can drop 32 ton bombs</text>
  <text start="956.99" dur="5.279">simultaneously and those are going to</text>
  <text start="960.17" dur="4.919">replace the rockwell b-1 lancer</text>
  <text start="962.269" dur="4.361">supersonic strategic bombers now we have</text>
  <text start="965.089" dur="3.791">another report where</text>
  <text start="966.63" dur="4.53">harder is out there saying that the him</text>
  <text start="968.88" dur="3.81">are battery are being deployed in the</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="3.21">Middle East right now this is a multiple</text>
  <text start="972.69" dur="3.18">rocket launcher and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="974.37" dur="4.01">used of course against the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="975.87" dur="6.11">he added that the us-led coalition is</text>
  <text start="978.38" dur="6.58">going to step up its cyber offensive</text>
  <text start="981.98" dur="8.14">against the terror group to disable</text>
  <text start="984.96" dur="7.71">their internet connections so we see</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="6.12">everything they&amp;#39;re telling us is kind of</text>
  <text start="992.67" dur="4.7">a half-truth here cyber warfare is going</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="4.62">to be on Syria</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="6.94">these new weapons coming in is going to</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="10.31">be used for the next phase of the battle</text>
  <text start="1004.31" dur="6.86">in Syria because if Assad stays in power</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="6.76">this whole thing is going to move</text>
  <text start="1014.87" dur="6.75">forward because the u.s. the coalition</text>
  <text start="1018.56" dur="9.24">forces their goal has always been the</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="10.5">same remove Assad put in a pipeline to</text>
  <text start="1027.8" dur="6.72">supply Europe with natural gas place the</text>
  <text start="1032.12" dur="5.28">dollar on the oil set up a central bank</text>
  <text start="1034.52" dur="5.25">and this is their path then into a ramp</text>
  <text start="1037.4" dur="4.169">and this has not changed</text>
