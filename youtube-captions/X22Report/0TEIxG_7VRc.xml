  <text start="43.87" dur="3.99">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46" dur="4.32">collapse news now we&amp;#39;re going to head</text>
  <text start="47.86" dur="6.6">out to Greece and it&amp;#39;s almost been about</text>
  <text start="50.32" dur="7.379">one year ago that the ECB concluded its</text>
  <text start="54.46" dur="6.739">largest European stress test and back</text>
  <text start="57.699" dur="6.121">then they said 25 banks are so failed</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="4.811">although the central bank properly added</text>
  <text start="63.82" dur="4.26">that just nine point five billion euros</text>
  <text start="66.01" dur="4.71">in that capital shortfall have been</text>
  <text start="68.08" dur="6.66">identified what was more surprising is</text>
  <text start="70.72" dur="5.82">that the ECB reported that the Greek</text>
  <text start="74.74" dur="5.75">banks alpha bank the National Bank of</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="7.47">Greece and others had entered a bailout</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="6.37">territory well fast forward to today the</text>
  <text start="84.01" dur="6.39">ECB is repeating its annual exercise and</text>
  <text start="86.86" dur="8.61">they&amp;#39;re seeing that the capital needs is</text>
  <text start="90.4" dur="7.2">now at 14.4 billion euros and what does</text>
  <text start="95.47" dur="5.97">this mean for the Greek people this</text>
  <text start="97.6" dur="8.01">means and as we know come January they</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="7.02">are eligible for balance and it looks</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="5.37">like the Greek people need the handover</text>
  <text start="108.46" dur="5.1">what little cash they have left to</text>
  <text start="110.98" dur="4.83">recapitalize these banks and we know</text>
  <text start="113.56" dur="4.02">sooner or later balance will be coming</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="3.99">to every single country we understand</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="3.84">the FDIC Bank of England created the</text>
  <text start="119.8" dur="4.32">bail and document back in twenty twelve</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="4.77">European nations have the bail in</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="5.1">documents Canada New Zealand and other</text>
  <text start="126.19" dur="5.37">countries they&amp;#39;re all set up ready to go</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="4.62">because when this system comes down the</text>
  <text start="131.56" dur="4.44">only place they need to look and the</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="5.64">only place they know withers the</text>
  <text start="136" dur="4.769">currency they need is in the banks and</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="3.66">this is where they&amp;#39;re going to go get it</text>
  <text start="140.769" dur="5.731">and we can see already from Cyprus now</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="5.519">Greece this is the new model and this is</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="6.17">why I say and this is what I do this is</text>
  <text start="148.659" dur="8.521">my opinion do not keep all of your</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="7.18">currency in the bank I only keep as much</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="4.47">as I need to pay the bills everything</text>
  <text start="159.85" dur="4.5">else is in the either cash gold and</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="3.24">silver hidden other places why would I</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="2.28">want to keep</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="4.23">the bank not getting any interest anyhow</text>
  <text start="166.63" dur="4.32">now out in Ukraine NATO supreme Allied</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="5.46">commander europe general Philip</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="6.66">Breedlove said the following at a press</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="5.879">conference in the Pentagon we have not</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.67">seen Russia removing any of its forces</text>
  <text start="180.459" dur="5.571">in Ukraine the command and control air</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="5.58">defense artillery spotting support</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="5.5">artillery support personal supplies all</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="5.61">still being supplied to DOM bass by</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="4.98">Russia of course they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="4.35">evidence for this they have no satellite</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.55">imagery they have no photographs or</text>
  <text start="198.82" dur="4.62">video basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re pushing the propaganda once</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="4.829">again the question is why would they be</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="4.65">doing this at this point if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.269" dur="5.371">trying to push forward the mins to sis</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="5.1">ceasefire agreement the mints to cease</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="4.74">fire was not created by the United</text>
  <text start="215.83" dur="6.06">States it was not created by a Kiev it</text>
  <text start="218.38" dur="6.92">was created by Russia to say you know</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="7.08">something let&amp;#39;s have peace in this area</text>
  <text start="225.3" dur="5.95">what motive would rush i have right now</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.59">to do what general be Breedlove says</text>
  <text start="231.25" dur="5.79">there would be no motive because this</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="4.739">would be a complete disaster now we</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="3.57">understand the United States government</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="5.331">central bankers are pushing and</text>
  <text start="240.61" dur="6.53">provoking war all around the world</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="7.78">specifically aimed at certain countries</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="6.28">North Korea Russia China and we know the</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="4.59">United States sailed their ships 12</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="6.599">nautical miles outside of the Spratly</text>
  <text start="256" dur="5.85">Islands to provoke China and there was</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="6.481">another agenda that was associated with</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="9.27">this it was to bring in all the existing</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="7.13">US allies around the area closer to the</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="5.58">United States now because of this event</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="6.4">what we are seeing is that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="276.7" dur="5.67">allies are saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="280.03" dur="5.94">need more weapons we need the United</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="8.64">States here in our area to protect us</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="8.91">and if we go back in time China back in</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="6.75">1947 actually claimed the largest swath</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="3.54">of territory in this area and they had a</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="2.49">map and they</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="4.89">listen we claim these island and of</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="5.64">course other countries like Vietnam the</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="4.58">Philippines saying no no you do not</text>
  <text start="305.89" dur="5.46">claim these these are part of our</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="6.52">country and the united states got</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="5.07">involved in this and if vietnam or the</text>
  <text start="314.41" dur="6.06">philippines have a problem why is the</text>
  <text start="316.42" dur="5.88">United States there at all I mean Japan</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="3.92">decided okay we&amp;#39;re going to have talks</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="4.95">with the Chinese government right now</text>
  <text start="324.39" dur="5.98">but we see the rest of the allies in the</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="6.74">region they are turning towards the</text>
  <text start="330.37" dur="6.42">United States asking for more weapons</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="5.32">now of course we know this is all part</text>
  <text start="336.79" dur="7.14">of the agenda to build this up and to</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="6.78">contain n encircle China now we know the</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="3.63">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="3.78">their main mission is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="5.97">Assad and there was a poll taken in</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="6.75">France from a French newspaper and they</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="4.32">sampled around 21,000 French adults it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="2.31">very interesting about this is that</text>
  <text start="357.85" dur="3.99">seventy two percent of the respondents</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="6.33">answered no to the survey question</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="6.45">should world powers demand Assad to</text>
  <text start="365.26" dur="4.83">leave and they said no but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="4.14">interesting about this is every time</text>
  <text start="370.09" dur="6.39">there&amp;#39;s a poll the government&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="6.15">listen to the people anymore oh yeah the</text>
  <text start="376.48" dur="4.32">people said no but what they really mean</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="5.21">is yes and they do whatever they want no</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="6.47">matter what here in the United States I</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="6.52">mean we have the same thing people</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="4.99">petition the White House the White House</text>
  <text start="390.31" dur="6.81">only responds to those that they want to</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="6.99">respond to not the real issues and we</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="3.39">can see right now that United States</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="3">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="3.75">continually pushing propaganda and</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re making things up I mean for</text>
  <text start="404.26" dur="7.5">instance in Vienna we understand the</text>
  <text start="407.11" dur="7.56">United States Iran Russia Syria the</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="6.27">coalition forces were all in that area</text>
  <text start="414.67" dur="8.61">for talks and it came out that Iran said</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="8.04">yes they agreed to remove Assad and have</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="7.74">a smooth transition within like the next</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="6.02">six months or so and this turned out to</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="4.369">be a</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="5.4">solutely false fake and phony this was</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="4.291">complete propaganda Iran is out there</text>
  <text start="437.49" dur="3.87">saying no we&amp;#39;ve never said this this is</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="3.959">propaganda from the United States and</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="4.26">this was never mentioned in the talks</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="3.601">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting about these</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="3.9">talks is they&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="5.55">ceasefire and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="6.72">Assad and the government and Russia</text>
  <text start="452.79" dur="5.31">actually backed United States into a</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="4.92">corner because the ceasefire that</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re talking about right now does not</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.009">include the terrorists the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="464.07" dur="4.17">and the other terrorist groups now the</text>
  <text start="466.169" dur="3.571">United States can&amp;#39;t say anything because</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="4.35">what are they gonna say well yes of</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="5.7">course it includes them because we back</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="5.19">them because there are terror so they</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="4.74">couldn&amp;#39;t say anything so rush is talking</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="6.359">about a ceasefire between the Free</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="8.04">Syrian Army and the Assad government but</text>
  <text start="484.139" dur="6.181">not with the terrorists and this is a</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="5.79">major problem for the United States</text>
  <text start="490.32" dur="6.599">because Putin is using their propaganda</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="5.04">against them and they can&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="496.919" dur="5.401">say no no that we support them we pay</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="5.79">for them they can&amp;#39;t say anything now</text>
  <text start="502.32" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s very interesting is the Treasury</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="6.06">Secretary always seems to know how much</text>
  <text start="508.68" dur="5.82">the Islamic state is making from their</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="5.85">oil sales in Syria but what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="514.5" dur="4.229">happening is Russia has been bombing the</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="3.539">Islamic state which is the products are</text>
  <text start="518.729" dur="5.821">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="520.289" dur="6.691">and they&amp;#39;re telling everyone that oil</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="6.21">sales now conducted by the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="7.2">has dropped dramatically and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="6.66">losing revenue as they continually push</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="5.25">them back and at the same time that</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re losing revenue right now and</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re losing ground in Syria the</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="4.8">United States came out and said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="4.8">going to give them a hundred million</text>
  <text start="546.57" dur="3.75">more dollars now of course they said</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="5.37">this to the Free Syrian Army but you</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="6">know it&amp;#39;s all one in the same they can</text>
  <text start="554.43" dur="4.89">call the moderates that calm Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="5.46">Army but all this is going to the</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="6">Islamic state because this is the proxy</text>
  <text start="561.78" dur="4.26">army so they already spent 500 million</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="3.75">dollars</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="5.31">and they trained what eight people or</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="3.72">whatever and then they went over right</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="3.419">over to the Islamic state which is part</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="4.289">of their plan but we know that most of</text>
  <text start="574.769" dur="4.801">these funds do not go to the training</text>
  <text start="577.079" dur="5.161">they&amp;#39;re going to the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="4.889">keep it operational and we can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="3.63">figure out how much they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="584.459" dur="3.99">giving them because they also have the</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="4.85">covert funds from the poppy fields where</text>
  <text start="588.449" dur="5.841">they&amp;#39;re selling drugs around the world</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="6.419">now this military presence in Syria</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="6.31">eventually is going to lead to a</text>
  <text start="597.139" dur="5.26">large-scale military presence in Syria</text>
  <text start="600.6" dur="3.57">because we know that they&amp;#39;re sending in</text>
  <text start="602.399" dur="4.531">a small force probably trying to clean</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="4.95">up a lot of their mess trying to capture</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="6.839">a lot of the cat intelligence cash</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="6.87">that&amp;#39;s all around Syria so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.769" dur="3.961">figure out or nobody can get ahold of</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="3.99">these documents to show that oh yes the</text>
  <text start="617.73" dur="3.63">Islamic state is definitely a proxy army</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="4.44">of the United States government central</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="8.399">bankers but as soon as these troops that</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="9.06">are in Syria start to take fire this is</text>
  <text start="629.759" dur="6.721">going to basically spring the</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="5.52">springboard this into more military</text>
  <text start="636.48" dur="4.589">coming into Syria and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="639" dur="5.069">going to stop with these you know 20 to</text>
  <text start="641.069" dur="6.171">50 Special Ops teams it&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="644.069" dur="7.651">further than this now over the weekend</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="8.649">which is which happened on Saturday we</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="7.71">saw a Russian commercial jet brought</text>
  <text start="655.889" dur="5.611">down now of course the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="4.5">Rose their hand up and said yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.5" dur="3.389">responsible for this we shot it down but</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="3.209">of course where they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="664.889" dur="6.481">weapons to hit a plane that&amp;#39;s thirty one</text>
  <text start="667.139" dur="5.491">thousand plus feet in the air and the</text>
  <text start="671.37" dur="3.39">only way they can bring this down is</text>
  <text start="672.63" dur="4.8">maybe a bomb on board or there could</text>
  <text start="674.76" dur="5.1">have been a malfunction right now</text>
  <text start="677.43" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;re reviewing the black box trying</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="5.729">to figure out what happened and the</text>
  <text start="682.439" dur="4.681">Islamic stay put out a video and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.589" dur="4.071">very interesting about this video was</text>
  <text start="687.12" dur="6.079">taken down right off the bat and then</text>
  <text start="689.66" dur="8.789">the video resurfaced now the video is</text>
  <text start="693.199" dur="6.881">hosted on a channel called News live HD</text>

  <text start="706.83" dur="7.98">24th 2015 and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="713.22" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s really not much on this channel</text>
  <text start="714.81" dur="5.28">and they have this video and it says</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="3.39">Isis claims in this video shooting down</text>
  <text start="720.09" dur="3.21">the Russian aircraft but when you look</text>
  <text start="721.65" dur="5.55">at the video and then you look at the</text>
  <text start="723.3" dur="7.89">past videos of the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="727.2" dur="9.11">were very well done High Definition care</text>
  <text start="731.19" dur="7.2">cameras and this video is blurred</text>
  <text start="736.31" dur="3.37">because if they actually did it they</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="2.4">would have their cameras standing by</text>
  <text start="739.68" dur="5.28">they would have everything ready to go</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="6.84">and it&amp;#39;s unfocused and then midway</text>
  <text start="744.96" dur="8.22">through it turns into black-and-white</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="10.47">footage and the person behind the voice</text>
  <text start="753.18" dur="7.11">is a one of those computer computerized</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="5.1">voices which you type in and it repeats</text>
  <text start="760.29" dur="6.15">what you just typed in so this video to</text>
  <text start="763.2" dur="6.75">me is looking like it&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="766.44" dur="6.69">phony and false this channel right here</text>
  <text start="769.95" dur="6.69">is a little suspicious because it was</text>
  <text start="773.13" dur="4.8">just created and everything does not fit</text>
  <text start="776.64" dur="2.73">into place and it doesn&amp;#39;t follow the</text>
  <text start="777.93" dur="4.44">format that the United States government</text>
  <text start="779.37" dur="7.02">central bankers Israel coalition forces</text>
  <text start="782.37" dur="6.09">use when they put out a video so a lot</text>
  <text start="786.39" dur="4.44">of this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now we have</text>
  <text start="788.46" dur="4.47">to think about this whole thing and put</text>
  <text start="790.83" dur="7.02">the pieces together here now the Islamic</text>
  <text start="792.93" dur="7.35">state is being pushed back in Syria</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="4.92">right now they&amp;#39;re losing the battle</text>
  <text start="800.28" dur="4.5">against Russia now if we believe the</text>
  <text start="802.77" dur="4.92">official story that this is a terrorist</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="4.8">group why in the world what would be</text>
  <text start="807.69" dur="4.32">their motive at this point in time to</text>
  <text start="809.58" dur="4.46">shoot down a Russian plane because you</text>
  <text start="812.01" dur="3.78">know this would not help them whatsoever</text>
  <text start="814.04" dur="5.8">because if you believe the official</text>
  <text start="815.79" dur="7.11">story if this is a terrorist group and</text>
  <text start="819.84" dur="4.77">Russia is fighting this terrorist group</text>
  <text start="822.9" dur="3.81">that has no association with the United</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="4.05">States this would just make it worse for</text>
  <text start="826.71" dur="5.31">them because Russia would bring in more</text>
  <text start="828.66" dur="5.279">forces and really obliterate them</text>
  <text start="832.02" dur="4.069">completely</text>
  <text start="833.939" dur="5.24">would not make the situation better and</text>
  <text start="836.089" dur="5.44">if you look at this and the other</text>
  <text start="839.179" dur="5.17">viewpoint of the United States is</text>
  <text start="841.529" dur="5.73">sponsoring the Islamic state which we</text>
  <text start="844.349" dur="8.34">know they are this is a message to</text>
  <text start="847.259" dur="10.5">Russia from the united states that this</text>
  <text start="852.689" dur="8.31">is going to get a lot worse you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.759" dur="7.16">destroying our proxy army you need to</text>
  <text start="860.999" dur="7.62">stop and if it doesn&amp;#39;t things will</text>
  <text start="864.919" dur="5.051">basically escalate we the United States</text>
  <text start="868.619" dur="5.34">government central banks are already</text>
  <text start="869.97" dur="7.5">bringing troops into the area of Syria</text>
  <text start="873.959" dur="6.69">and Iraq even though the president has</text>
  <text start="877.47" dur="4.349">told us that no we will have no boots on</text>
  <text start="880.649" dur="3.09">the ground which we know this is</text>
  <text start="881.819" dur="4.8">completely lie and he told us this 16</text>
  <text start="883.739" dur="6.45">times so we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="886.619" dur="5.55">time who has the real motive to send a</text>
  <text start="890.189" dur="5.73">message it is the United States and</text>
  <text start="892.169" dur="5.97">during the talks in Vienna they said the</text>
  <text start="895.919" dur="4.801">terrorists are not part of the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="898.139" dur="4.92">which backed the United States into a</text>
  <text start="900.72" dur="4.709">corner because they can&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="903.059" dur="4.23">say they must be included in the</text>
  <text start="905.429" dur="3.96">ceasefire because they&amp;#39;re terrorists and</text>
  <text start="907.289" dur="4.14">if they did come out and say this then</text>
  <text start="909.389" dur="4.23">it would look like the United States is</text>
  <text start="911.429" dur="4.53">completely backing them and they are</text>
  <text start="913.619" dur="5.4">supporting them so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="915.959" dur="6.511">United States if this is really a downed</text>
  <text start="919.019" dur="6.12">plane the United States sent a message</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="6.689">to Russia that&amp;#39;s what this is all about</text>
  <text start="925.139" dur="6.36">because of Russia being in Syria messing</text>
  <text start="929.159" dur="4.08">up their plans in Ukraine listen</text>
