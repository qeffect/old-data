  <text start="88.35" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve talked about how Trump and the</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="3.901">Patriots they needed to bring back</text>
  <text start="92.19" dur="5.79">manufacturing to the United States now</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="6.87">we know over a long period of time the</text>
  <text start="97.98" dur="6.14">central bankers the steep state their</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="5.79">entire plan was to move all</text>
  <text start="104.12" dur="5.2">manufacturing corporations out of the</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="5.63">United States and they have been doing</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="6.839">this since 1971 they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="112.31" dur="5.8">companies out of the country this was</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="3.661">being done on purpose of course they</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="3.51">couldn&amp;#39;t do it too quickly because</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="2.13">people would notice like what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="121.62" dur="2.52">here</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="4.77">all of a sudden 50 companies just left</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="5.519">so they did it very very slowly very</text>
  <text start="126.72" dur="6.689">methodically and they did it over time</text>
  <text start="129.659" dur="6.151">they used regulation until here we are</text>
  <text start="133.409" dur="5.311">today where we lost most of our</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="5.759">manufacturing Trump came into the</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="6.15">presidency and he only has a short</text>
  <text start="141.569" dur="6.42">period of time to remedy this but once</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.009">again what is the problem the problem is</text>
  <text start="147.989" dur="5.101">that we&amp;#39;re in a central bank illusionary</text>
  <text start="149.879" dur="6.451">system which is crashing a central bank</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="3.869">system only lasts 45 to 50 years at the</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="3.45">most</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="3.931">yes you can keep it going but it breaks</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="2.97">down on the outer</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="4.77">ages and then it comes in and it</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="5.91">completely implodes this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.66" dur="4.68">seeing today we&amp;#39;re at the end stage of a</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="4.14">central banking system this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="5.58">to keep the system going this is why he</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="5.31">needed to cut rates and he needed to</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="5.25">start stimulus again because if he just</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="6.54">let interest rates rise normally or if</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.52">the Fed artificially raises them the</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="3.99">entire system just completely implodes</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="2.46">and at the same time what was the Fed</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="3.48">doing</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="5.96">they were tightening their books now</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="5.4">since the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="5.62">imploding remember Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="197.52" dur="5.13">they only have a couple of years to undo</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="3.99">everything the globalists and the</text>
  <text start="202.65" dur="4.23">central bankers have been doing over the</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="5.4">many many years they knew this was</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.04">impossible they knew that this couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="3.24">be done first of all the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="4.2">in the United States has been</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="5.52">deteriorating the leaders that were</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="3.96">before Trump they were not taking care</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="2.88">of the United States</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="4.79">they weren&amp;#39;t rebuilding the</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="5.1">infrastructure it&amp;#39;s all falling apart</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="3.25">yes Trump is trying to get an</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="4.56">infrastructure bill he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="5.16">the central bank funds against them and</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="5.129">try to rebuild in that states which I</text>
  <text start="233.28" dur="6.929">think he will do and then eventually say</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="6.961">okay you know something this whole thing</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="7.441">is a scam they might have an audit to</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="7.56">prove this but the Patriots they knew</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="6.74">they didn&amp;#39;t have this time so they</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="5.55">needed to counter this someway somehow</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="5.319">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="5.58">minute but first we can see that Trump</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="5.551">is using all weapons against the central</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="4.65">bank and the deep state and the economy</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="5.25">statistically of course and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="7.35">people to get confused we have a central</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="6.54">bank system and what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="4.98">not going to fix this system he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="5.42">going to fix the Fiat central bank</text>
  <text start="279.18" dur="5.94">system he is just using the tools that</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="5.02">he has right now because we&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="5.46">inside of this system he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="5.02">their tools against them to get</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="4.06">reelected and you</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.43">need to show that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="7.88">well one thing that the people have in</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="10.23">common and that I have to say is money</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="8.56">currency and jobs when people feel</text>
  <text start="308.17" dur="6.62">comfortable when people feel good and</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="10.2">they feel like the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="10.18">they like that leader period and if</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="6.09">you&amp;#39;re running for reelection you want</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="4.74">to make sure that everyone understands</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="5.1">that if you like this economy if you</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="3.96">like what&amp;#39;s going on right now you got</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="2.81">to keep me now</text>
  <text start="333.67" dur="5.64">the people that going up against Trump</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="6.73">they don&amp;#39;t have a platform on the</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="3.75">economy to stand on what are they going</text>
  <text start="342.01" dur="4.38">to say they&amp;#39;re gonna make it a lot</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="5.43">better I don&amp;#39;t like this great economy I</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t like the stock market continually</text>
  <text start="348.49" dur="4.62">moving up and remember Trump how to do</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="2.76">this because since the interest rates</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="3.68">are so low</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="5.64">pensions they&amp;#39;re no longer based on</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="4.77">interest rates they&amp;#39;re gambling in the</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="6.57">stock market the stock market came down</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="6.94">people&amp;#39;s pensions would implode so he</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="5.55">had to make the market move up plus this</text>
  <text start="368.5" dur="5.01">gives them an added benefit everyone</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="5.49">believes that the market is sometime</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="7.14">somehow some way a gauge of how the</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="5.43">economy&amp;#39;s doing but it really isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="4.29">mainstream media has making us believe</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.83">that it has been for many many years and</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="4.38">of course what you do is you show that</text>
  <text start="387.13" dur="3.99">other numbers other statistics are</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="5.46">looking really good if you look at the</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="6.06">jobless claims they fell by ten thousand</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="5.73">to two hundred and three thousand now</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="5.04">the fall in jobless claims indicates</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="4.59">that the labor market remains tight and</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="4.46">layoffs scarce now we know that these</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="4.35">numbers are manipulated but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="5.17">pretend they&amp;#39;re not they have been for a</text>
  <text start="409.45" dur="5.7">very long time and once again Trump is</text>
  <text start="411.85" dur="6.48">using this to get to where he needs to</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="9.8">be that&amp;#39;s what this is this whole thing</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="9.29">is a show now the jobless claims</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="9.03">these are the lowest weekly jobless</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="9.78">claims numbers since 1969 didn&amp;#39;t we come</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="5.25">off the gold standard in 71 so he</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="5.25">brought these numbers all the way back</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="4.62">to that time period that is amazing and</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="3.69">when everyone&amp;#39;s looking at this</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="5.73">everyone&amp;#39;s you know their minds are</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="5.67">blown look at the jobless claims look at</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="5.28">unemployment look at GDP look at the</text>
  <text start="452.01" dur="5.55">stock market look what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="8.16">he&amp;#39;s saving us money with the NATO</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="7.74">summit he we negotiated trade deals we</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="4.65">have a new trade deal what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.26">u.s. MCA and we know eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="4.89">going to happen here we know eventually</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="4.86">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="3.69">have to restructure the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="5.37">the Federal Reserve is a private</text>
  <text start="476.25" dur="5.73">corporation United States does not need</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="5.25">a private corporation running its</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="5.4">economy because their interest is not in</text>
  <text start="485.04" dur="6.3">the people their interest is making</text>
  <text start="487.38" dur="5.22">profit for themselves period and if you</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="4.86">look at some of the federal reserve</text>
  <text start="492.6" dur="6.47">governors they make between 346 thousand</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="5.79">and four hundred and sixty six thousand</text>
  <text start="499.07" dur="5.46">now these are the low level Federal</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="6.8">Reserve governors throughout the states</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="8.74">their total salaries are two billion and</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="7.6">the track record for the Fed is 0 for 3</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="6.69">on the greatest bubbles 0 for every</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="7.5">recession system crashed in 2008 under</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="6.87">their supervision and it&amp;#39;s just getting</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="6.51">worse actually the Fed helped rollback</text>
  <text start="526.83" dur="7.32">dodd-frank so why would we ever want</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="7.02">them we wouldn&amp;#39;t trumpet the Patriots</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="5.52">they know this and they understand that</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to have to restructure the</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="5.13">Fed actually I&amp;#39;ll think it will be</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="6.96">engulfed into the Treasury and the</text>
  <text start="544.8" dur="5.25">people will control the creation of</text>
  <text start="548.31" dur="3.9">currency when this is all said and done</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.43">I do believe that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="5.46">and remember the plan is to get a lot of</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.91">these manufacturers</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="6">out of China that is why Trump right now</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="5.22">has tariffs placed in trying to remember</text>
  <text start="563.67" dur="5.67">the globalists the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="6">are moving everything off to China or to</text>
  <text start="569.34" dur="5.64">other Asian countries Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="5.73">reversing this now the process is slow</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="6.54">we all know this the process can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="578.34" dur="4.77">sped up it&amp;#39;s completely impossible yes</text>
  <text start="581.52" dur="3.06">there are companies that are moving out</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.17">of China they&amp;#39;re moving into are the</text>
  <text start="584.58" dur="4.47">locations some are even moving back to</text>
  <text start="587.28" dur="4.68">the United States but remember the</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="5.4">globalists the central banks the the</text>
  <text start="591.96" dur="6.96">deep state they&amp;#39;ve had years upon years</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="7.94">upon years to push their agenda Trump</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="7.73">the Patriots they don&amp;#39;t have this time</text>
  <text start="602.39" dur="7.84">so they found a way to get around this</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="6.37">it is called the u.s. MCA and I know</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="5.97">that Trump he continually pushes Nancy</text>
  <text start="613.02" dur="6.17">Pelosi to push to pass this we need it</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="5.79">passed and they don&amp;#39;t want to pass this</text>
  <text start="619.19" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re holding it they&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="8.81">the right moment because they know if</text>
  <text start="623.7" dur="11.31">they pass US jobs are gonna be created</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="9.07">the economy the manufacturing is going</text>
  <text start="635.01" dur="8.33">to boom why is this while trumping the</text>
  <text start="639.87" dur="7.38">Patriots they knew that Canada Mexico</text>
  <text start="643.34" dur="7.06">especially Mexico they had manufacturing</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="6.39">they already had the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="650.4" dur="5.49">there built a lot of the automobile</text>
  <text start="653.64" dur="3.87">manufacturers are down in Mexico a lot</text>
  <text start="655.89" dur="5.43">of other manufacturers are down in</text>
  <text start="657.51" dur="5.79">Mexico and they knew that the United</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="3.51">States couldn&amp;#39;t bring all the</text>
  <text start="663.3" dur="5.49">manufacturers back to the United States</text>
  <text start="664.83" dur="6.66">now Trump he&amp;#39;s doing his best job to</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="5.04">keep manufacturers here in United&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="671.49" dur="5.43">Apple they&amp;#39;re developing the Mac Pro</text>
  <text start="673.83" dur="6.87">here in the United States he needed a</text>
  <text start="676.92" dur="7.23">way to make sure that we controlled the</text>
  <text start="680.7" dur="5.94">manufacturing once companies move out of</text>
  <text start="684.15" dur="5.39">China maybe some back to the United</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="4.27">States we needed a way to make a</text>
  <text start="689.54" dur="3.62">manufacturing base</text>
  <text start="690.91" dur="5.12">even though we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="693.16" dur="6.44">manufacturers here in the United States</text>
  <text start="696.03" dur="7.15">this is why he came up with the USMC a</text>
  <text start="699.6" dur="10.32">because he knew he could use Mexico to</text>
