  <text start="125.97" dur="4.259">problem is completely out of hand and we</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="3.629">understand that the debt is continually</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.961">growing and there&amp;#39;s hat there has been</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="3.841">warnings out there letting us know that</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="135.66" dur="2.88">problems plus we understand that the</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="3.39">central banks have been keeping the</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="4.65">interest rates very very low and the biz</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="4.35">is continually coming out with their</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="4.53">warning messages now this is the central</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="5.7">banks of central banks and basically</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="5.519">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the central</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="6.18">banks right now are in danger of falling</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="6">into a debt trap where they can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="6.12">needed action for fear of triggering</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="8.161">defaults and economic turmoil and this</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="6.02">is coming from a senior a senior Bank of</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="5.339">International Settlements official</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="7.18">Claudio borio and he gave a speech in</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="6.421">London and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="5.04">there is no way around this the debt is</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="3.75">too large there&amp;#39;s nothing that the</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="2.82">central banks can do this is why</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="3.81">interest rate to need to be kept very</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="4.47">very low they continually need to add</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="4.38">more debt to the system because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="3.75">no way around this and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.05">going to happen is that this whole</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="5.64">system is going to basically include on</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="5.28">itself and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="4.23">there is inflation out there all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="4.2">doing is siphoning it off in two</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="3.84">different directions so no one realizes</text>
  <text start="204.63" dur="5.25">that there&amp;#39;s real inflation but if you</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="6.51">really look at food and at tuition at</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="4.56">housing prices you can see this is where</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve been putting it all and this is</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="6.15">where it&amp;#39;s going and again these low</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="4.8">interest rates well they&amp;#39;re encouraging</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="4.08">a record amount of borrowing that means</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s more debt out here out there</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="5.07">plus they&amp;#39;re the central banks are</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="5.01">buying stocks we see all the central</text>
  <text start="229.74" dur="4.29">banks around the world doing this and</text>
  <text start="231.3" dur="4.95">this is going to be a major problem and</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing these warnings over and</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="6.38">over again because they understand that</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="8.73">this cannot be sustained whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="6.91">at this point I mean the published debt</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="4.23">problem here in the United States is 20</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="4.5">trillion dollars but we know behind the</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="5.13">scenes the debt is much much higher</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="4.86">especially in the global arena we</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="3.84">understand that they miscalculated the</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="6.66">debt problem by about 16 trillion</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="8.79">dollars or so and there&amp;#39;s no way that</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="7.2">this can be maintained right now on how</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="5.16">the economy is operating because look at</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="3.93">all these different areas France or</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="3.99">looking at Germany we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="5.64">Spain Greece United States Australia</text>
  <text start="279" dur="4.5">Canada the UK there are so many people</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="3.48">that are out of work and all these</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="4.44">statistics have been manipulated so far</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="3.99">you don&amp;#39;t even know what the truth is</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="3.09">anymore just because someone tells you</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.09">that unemployment here in the United</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="3.03">States for example is that four point</text>
  <text start="292.89" dur="2.37">seven percent or four point eight</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="2.85">percent and they&amp;#39;re saying well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="3.57">almost at full employment they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.74">telling you the quality of jobs how much</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="4.32">money people are actually making do they</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.72">have one two three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="4.62">because they count that part-time job as</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="4.41">a full-time job so they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="3.48">giving you the full picture they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="3.21">throwing out a number telling you that</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="3.18">everything is fine but if you</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="3.5">continually manipulate all the</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="5.52">statistics throughout time well you</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="4.09">don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s real anymore and we</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="2.219">could see</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="3">from the real indicators like tax</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="4.141">receipts coming into the government</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="5.19">those have been declining since 2008</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="5.069">that tells us that the jobs have been</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="4.709">low paying jobs because if you have high</text>
  <text start="331.379" dur="5.04">paying jobs people actually pay more</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="5.37">taxes yes some people can get around it</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="4.8">some people can pay less taxes but you</text>
  <text start="338.849" dur="5.37">know most of the people don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="341.219" dur="4.621">and they pay their normal taxes and the</text>
  <text start="344.219" dur="3.66">tax receipts would be going up they</text>
  <text start="345.84" dur="3.569">wouldn&amp;#39;t be going down plus in retail</text>
  <text start="347.879" dur="3.57">you would see the same thing you would</text>
  <text start="349.409" dur="4.5">see stores expanding you would see</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="4.59">online expanding in a much much faster</text>
  <text start="353.909" dur="4.531">pace everything would be a lot better</text>
  <text start="356.039" dur="4.171">right now but it is not we see that</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="4.11">Obamacare well this looks like this</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.41">might be dead in the water this repeal</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="4.829">that they&amp;#39;re trying to do we see McCain</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="3.66">is saying no Cruz is saying no and it</text>
  <text start="367.379" dur="2.94">really doesn&amp;#39;t matter at this point</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="3.3">because that is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s going to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.92">because the premiums are way too high</text>
  <text start="374.159" dur="4.56">the premiums for employers is way too</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="3.629">high and people are looking at this</text>
  <text start="378.719" dur="3.361">thing I just can&amp;#39;t afford this this is</text>
  <text start="380.129" dur="3.961">just absolutely out of my reach right</text>
  <text start="382.08" dur="4.079">now I don&amp;#39;t have a high paying job and</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do about it except</text>
  <text start="386.159" dur="6.301">to take that penalty we see out in Spain</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.369">right now well it looks like they trot</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="5.549">the Spanish government tried to put</text>
  <text start="394.949" dur="5.761">pressure on all the local mayors they</text>
  <text start="398.009" dur="5.13">were confiscating millions of ballots to</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="6.06">stop the October 1st independence</text>
  <text start="403.139" dur="5.64">referendum and the groups out there they</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="4.41">are protesting they&amp;#39;re marching and</text>
  <text start="408.779" dur="5.431">they&amp;#39;re saying we are going forward with</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="5.729">this referendum we want independence and</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="5.4">at this point we can see that the polls</text>
  <text start="416.909" dur="5.37">show that 7.5 million residents of</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="5.76">Catalonia are roughly split on breaking</text>
  <text start="422.279" dur="5.19">with the rest of Spain but as the</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="4.44">Spanish government continually you know</text>
  <text start="427.469" dur="3.45">cracks down on them a lot of these</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="3.18">individuals are saying you know</text>
  <text start="430.919" dur="4.381">something maybe we should be separate</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="4.919">and apart and it&amp;#39;s having the opposite</text>
  <text start="435.3" dur="4.619">effect right now and it looks like all</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="3.66">these voters all these residents are</text>
  <text start="439.919" dur="3.21">saying you know something we don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="3.15">the way the government is reacting right</text>
  <text start="443.129" dur="3.15">now maybe we should have our</text>
  <text start="444.719" dur="3.271">independence and they&amp;#39;re switching sides</text>
  <text start="446.279" dur="4.411">so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch that very</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="5.039">carefully that is coming up in about six</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="3.91">days or so and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see</text>
  <text start="453.029" dur="3.671">how that plays out</text>
  <text start="454.6" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ll take a look at it as we approach</text>
  <text start="456.7" dur="4.83">October first we&amp;#39;ll look at it on</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="6.99">October first and see what does occur at</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="5.67">that time point out in North Korea well</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="3.99">we see things are really heating up</text>
  <text start="467.2" dur="5.79">there the United States the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="469.42" dur="5.91">they a flew their US Air Force b-1b</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="4.77">Lancer bombers and they were escorted by</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="4.5">fighter jets and flew in international</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="6.39">airspace over waters east of North Korea</text>
  <text start="479.83" dur="6.57">but it was right at the border of North</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="4.95">Korea this is the furthest that the</text>
  <text start="486.4" dur="5.43">United States has flown any bomber or</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="4.98">jet and the DMZ is a strip of land</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="4.5">running across the Korean Peninsula near</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="3.9">the 38th parallel and it separates in</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="4.2">North Korea in South Korea and it was</text>
  <text start="497.98" dur="4.98">created back in 1953 and the United</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="4.68">States flew right up to that point and</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="4.65">this is very very close to North Korea</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="5.97">and this was to scare North Korea to</text>
  <text start="507.61" dur="5.91">provoke north to North Korea and once</text>
  <text start="511.18" dur="4.919">again North Korea is not going to stop</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="4.32">developing their nuclear program their</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="4.411">missile program just because the United</text>
  <text start="517.84" dur="4.44">States flies their bombers there Russia</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="3.99">is out there and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="522.28" dur="3.72">Sergey Lavrov is saying that the United</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="3.06">States is not going to attack North</text>
  <text start="526" dur="3.75">Korea whatsoever because the United</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="4.53">States already understands and realizes</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="6.09">that North Korea does have a nuclear</text>
  <text start="532.09" dur="5.67">bomb if they attack and of course Sergey</text>
  <text start="535.84" dur="4.41">Lavrov is saying they don&amp;#39;t have all the</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="5.34">information but they realize they do</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="5.58">have a nuclear weapon and if they go in</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="5.31">and attack you know that North Korea</text>
  <text start="545.83" dur="5.4">will use it because they need some type</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="5.55">of defense they will launch it they will</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="4.95">you know try to use it any way they</text>
  <text start="553.96" dur="4.53">possibly can and this would be a</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="4.35">complete and utter disaster and this is</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="3.84">why Russia is saying there&amp;#39;s no way at</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="5.13">this point the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="5.1">do anything now we understand out in the</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="5.61">Middle East things are really heating up</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="6.33">and we see it with the Kurdistan region</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="4.02">now we talked about this before and we</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="4.46">understand that the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="6.36">Qaeda the Syrian democratic forces the</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="4.63">moderate rebels they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="581.65" dur="3.3">wiped out</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="5.13">very very shortly there their numbers</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="3.69">are dwindling very very quickly and we</text>
  <text start="587.98" dur="3.42">can</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="4.89">the cabal&amp;#39;s plan is now switching</text>
  <text start="591.4" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re moving to a completely different</text>
  <text start="593.53" dur="4.26">plan and this is what they planned on</text>
  <text start="595.48" dur="3.75">all along and they realize that they</text>
  <text start="597.79" dur="2.76">can&amp;#39;t do anything with the Islamic say</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="4.02">they can&amp;#39;t do anything with al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="4.53">with this Syrian democratic forces so</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re going to be using the Kurds now</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="4.59">the Kurds are also doing what the</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="3.66">Catalonians are doing they&amp;#39;re going for</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="4.89">an independence referendum on September</text>
  <text start="611.77" dur="3.96">25th which is tomorrow now the Iraqi</text>

  <text start="844.51" dur="6.42">they want what the Cabal is doing right</text>
  <text start="847.54" dur="5.76">now they are creating chaos in these two</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="4.56">regions in Syria and Iraq with the Kurds</text>
  <text start="853.3" dur="4.65">and with North Korea they</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="5.73">an event they want something to happen</text>
  <text start="857.95" dur="6.09">now they want to make Russia still the</text>
  <text start="861.22" dur="6.51">enemy they haven&amp;#39;t given up on this now</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="6.45">over the past week or so there have been</text>
  <text start="867.73" dur="5.669">a wave of fake bomb threats across</text>
  <text start="870.49" dur="5.909">Russia and this has entered its second</text>
  <text start="873.399" dur="5.13">week and what they&amp;#39;re saying is this is</text>
  <text start="876.399" dur="4.771">a full-scale cyber war because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878.529" dur="5.071">been happening right now is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="881.17" dur="4.109">calling in and these are all fake calls</text>
  <text start="883.6" dur="4.739">they&amp;#39;ve never found anything these are</text>
  <text start="885.279" dur="6.091">all fake calls and this is going through</text>
  <text start="888.339" dur="5.461">the internet and they&amp;#39;re trying to trace</text>
  <text start="891.37" dur="6.18">where this is coming from these these</text>
  <text start="893.8" dur="6.06">calls aren&amp;#39;t from real people this is</text>
  <text start="897.55" dur="4.74">all done through the internet through</text>
  <text start="899.86" dur="4.95">computer systems where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="902.29" dur="5.4">computer voice saying that these that</text>
  <text start="904.81" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s a bomb in a shopping mall a bomb</text>
  <text start="907.69" dur="3.6">in this area and about 400,000 people</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="3.63">have been evacuated</text>
  <text start="911.29" dur="5.25">for more than a more than a thousand</text>
  <text start="913.81" dur="4.89">shopping malls airports government and</text>
  <text start="916.54" dur="4.71">other buildings around the country since</text>
  <text start="918.7" dur="4.74">it started two weeks ago and Russia is</text>
  <text start="921.25" dur="5.579">saying that they are prepared for a</text>
  <text start="923.44" dur="5.16">full-scale cyber war using telephone</text>
  <text start="926.829" dur="5.431">terrorism this is what they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="928.6" dur="6.27">it right now now most likely this is</text>
  <text start="932.26" dur="5.99">connected to the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="934.87" dur="6.54">the Cabal where they&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="938.25" dur="5.32">Russia into the fold and they want them</text>
  <text start="941.41" dur="6.15">to do something somehow some way and</text>
  <text start="943.57" dur="6.78">keep them on edge and the way these this</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="4.38">has been done is that they use a chain</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="5.07">of servers located in different</text>
  <text start="951.94" dur="6.209">jurisdictions to make the calls and they</text>
  <text start="955.42" dur="5.58">use voice modulation software and Google</text>
  <text start="958.149" dur="5.221">Translate that makes it impossible to</text>
  <text start="961" dur="5.16">trace and Russia is saying right now</text>
  <text start="963.37" dur="5.61">that you know this is going to ramp up</text>
  <text start="966.16" dur="4.14">in the next couple of weeks and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="968.98" dur="4.62">saying so far all of them have been</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="5.13">hoaxes and it looks like the the Cabal</text>
  <text start="973.6" dur="3.69">will the intelligence agencies won&amp;#39;t on</text>
  <text start="975.43" dur="3.75">the same actually they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="977.29" dur="4.56">Russia on edge right now because it</text>
  <text start="979.18" dur="4.02">looks like their plan at this point and</text>
  <text start="981.85" dur="5.09">looks like they&amp;#39;re going forward with it</text>
  <text start="983.2" dur="5.91">is to create chaos within North Korea</text>
  <text start="986.94" dur="5.95">with that whole situation</text>
  <text start="989.11" dur="6.06">with Syria and Iraq and to keep Russia</text>
  <text start="992.89" dur="5.25">on edge worrying about something else</text>
  <text start="995.17" dur="4.979">while they create these events and we</text>
  <text start="998.14" dur="3.75">can see in the next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="1000.149" dur="3.451">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch us now</text>

  <text start="1011.7" dur="4.829">to show that the central banks are not</text>
  <text start="1014.07" dur="3.93">responsible for any of this even though</text>
  <text start="1016.529" dur="2.671">the business given people the discretion</text>
  <text start="1018" dur="2.85">about why is that biz giving the</text>
  <text start="1019.2" dur="3.87">warnings like this because the biz is</text>
