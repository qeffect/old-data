  <text start="102.33" dur="5.55">now we talked about Obamacare quite a</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="4.17">bit and we can see right now Trump did</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.379">promise that he&amp;#39;ll be getting rid of</text>
  <text start="109.44" dur="5.67">Obamacare when he comes into office and</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="5.97">we see the process is already in motion</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="5.759">we see Republican senators Ted Cruz of</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="5.491">Texas Mike Lee of Utah Marco Rubio of</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="5.551">Florida well they&amp;#39;re reaffirming their</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="5.55">support for repealing Obamacare using a</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="4.98">reconciliation this year but are calling</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="3.42">on Senate leaders to craft a bill that</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.29">goes further than the previous</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="5.129">legislation passed in 2015 so we can see</text>
  <text start="135.69" dur="5.79">already the wheels are in motion so</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="6.39">Trump right now is having pence lead</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="5.97">this up and they are creating executive</text>
  <text start="144.209" dur="6.211">actions to start unwinding Obamacare on</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="5.039">day one and pence went out to say that</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="4.98">our first order of business will be to</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="5.281">repeal and replace Obamacare now of</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="4.02">course Obama doesn&amp;#39;t like this the elite</text>
  <text start="157.77" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t like this the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t like this because what they really</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="6.27">wanted was a system where it generated</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="6.72">them a lot of money and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="7.62">be taking this away so we already see</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="8.569">that the repeal of Obamacare has already</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="6.6">cleared the first hurdle Republicans</text>
  <text start="180.379" dur="8.051">they had a vote in</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="8.13">Senate and a vote was 51 to 48 and the</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="5.04">54 page document unveiled yesterday by</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="5.25">Budget Chairman Mike Enzi directs</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="4.829">Committees of jurisdictions to come up</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="6.17">with an affordable care act legislation</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="7.951">by January 27th meaning a repeal bill</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="7.42">could be to donald trump&amp;#39;s desks by the</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="7.349">end of february and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="6.569">point what he said and what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="213.599" dur="6.961">aren&amp;#39;t matching up right now which means</text>
  <text start="216.299" dur="7.53">that tax penalty would disappear for</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="4.86">many individuals now of course they have</text>
  <text start="223.829" dur="3.451">to come up with something completely</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="4.08">different or they have to put the system</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="4.59">the back the way it was and then come up</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="4.019">with something different but we can see</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="4.14">the system that they put into place</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="4.11">remember that bill the law that was</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="3.33">passed the Affordable Care Act they</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="5.791">couldn&amp;#39;t read it until they passed it</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="7.229">well it didn&amp;#39;t work it wasn&amp;#39;t a benefit</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="6.149">to the people the people the majority of</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="5.82">the people were not receiving a benefit</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="4.92">from this it was hurting more than it</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="5.041">was helping and this was the major</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="4.59">problem because all those individuals do</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="4.5">have that had to get rid of their</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="4.501">insurance remember the insurance had to</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="3.51">be compliant with Obamacare and if it</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.51">wasn&amp;#39;t you had to get rid of it and go</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.289">back onto the system and get insurance</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s how they really got all those</text>
  <text start="269.729" dur="3.541">individuals on the plan in the first</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="3.36">place it wasn&amp;#39;t like oh look we just</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="3.75">found all these extra people who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="5.28">have health insurance and they came on</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="6.84">no their plans were dropped and they had</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="8.15">to go get other insurance and of course</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="8.1">the poor they were being subsidized and</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="5.62">we see right now that if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="5.82">put something into place it has to be a</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="6.72">benefit to the people the people not a</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="6.54">select group of people and if this was</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="6.84">so great why didn&amp;#39;t everyone in</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="7.279">government drop their health plans and</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="7.53">go on Obamacare to show the people how</text>
  <text start="311.599" dur="5.111">fantastic it was did you notice that no</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="5.04">one really did this</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="4.98">and maybe a few but even the staffers at</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="4.56">the time said listen we can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="7.59">this this is way too expensive and Obama</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="6.66">came in and exempted them so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="4.02">seeing right now is all those people who</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.079">are saying oh you shouldn&amp;#39;t do it you</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="5.459">know what drop what you have and go out</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="3.541">and pay for it and let me know how it</text>
  <text start="338.759" dur="2.28">goes</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="3.42">all these people who are saying oh you</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="3.481">can&amp;#39;t let it go it&amp;#39;s so great</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="5.12">they have incredible insurance in the</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="5.97">government they made sure they have and</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="7.569">it&amp;#39;s funny how they didn&amp;#39;t take it on if</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="8.429">it&amp;#39;s so fantastic we see that the Trump</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="7.5">transition team they are asking homeland</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="7.651">security some important questions here</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="6.061">they want to know if anyone in the</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="5.04">Department of Homeland Security whether</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="6.14">any immigrant records have been changed</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="6">for any reason did they alter</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="3.94">documentation now of course the</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="3.9">corporate media is out there saying oh</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.39">my god how dare he asked this department</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="7.2">if they&amp;#39;ve done anything like this well</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="7.11">he wants to know did you alter any</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="5.429">documentation to get these individuals</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="5.02">into the United States and to move them</text>
  <text start="394.139" dur="5.25">to their select cities I don&amp;#39;t see a</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="4.23">problem with that but of course the</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="4.5">corporate media is making a really big</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="5.31">deal about this and we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="5.611">that people were being shipped all over</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.989">the United States WikiLeaks is out there</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="5.849">right now and they were offering a</text>
  <text start="412.039" dur="6.491">$20,000 reward to anyone who exposes the</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="6.6">destruction of significant Records by a</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="5.129">member of the Obama administration now</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="5.791">they tweeted on Tuesday evening</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="6.211">WikiLeaks said we are issuing a 20,000</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="5.31">dollar reward for information leading to</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="5.519">the arrest or exposure of any Obama</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="4.47">admin agent destroying significant</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="3.78">records however it is not explicitly</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="5.66">alleged that the administration is</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="7.86">suspected of removing or erratically</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="7.09">destroying records but they did this for</text>
  <text start="447.029" dur="6.451">a reason because the announcement</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="5.46">was provoked by a previous tweet in</text>
  <text start="453.48" dur="3.99">which WikiLeaks hinted that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="4.47">government is quietly eradicating</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="6.78">mentions of the organization from</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="7.29">official statements WikiLeaks disappears</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="4.77">from US government statements and you</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="4.26">could see this on the x-22 report.com</text>
  <text start="469.02" dur="6.12">site or on youtube you can see it there</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="6.66">where they&amp;#39;re comparing October 7 2016 2</text>
  <text start="475.14" dur="7.38">December 16th of 2016 and December 29th</text>
  <text start="478.41" dur="6.87">of 2016 where WikiLeaks that information</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="7.35">is removed from government documentation</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="7.11">which is very odd and strange so he</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.07">wants people to come forward to say yes</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="5.13">we have been doing this we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="4.44">see where this goes now out in North</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="3.77">Korea we understand the United States</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="6.27">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="501.29" dur="7.09">pushing and provoking North Korea and we</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="4.71">can see that they are doing this for a</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="5.07">reason now remember the players are all</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="5.91">the same China North Korea Syria Iran</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="7.04">Russia they&amp;#39;re all going to be involved</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="7.05">in a war if the elite can get it started</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="6.04">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting out of</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="6.18">Stratford there was an opinion piece on</text>
  <text start="526.53" dur="8.63">how the US could derail North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="9.93">nuclear program and this is a feeler to</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="5.92">see how people react to it and they</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.58">normally put these things out there to</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="6.09">see you know what the response would be</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="6.07">now they&amp;#39;re talking about having a</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="6.96">limited strike on North Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="7.83">program or a regime change in North</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="7.26">Korea and what they say is the first</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="5.25">minimalist strike specifically focused</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="5.36">on dismantling North Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="6.36">weapons program would be a scenario</text>
  <text start="566.75" dur="6.88">where they would come in they would hit</text>
  <text start="569.52" dur="8.31">a certain area and they would destroy</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="8.16">their nuclear program and again this</text>
  <text start="577.83" dur="6.3">could start World War three or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="6.69">saying that the leader of North Korea</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="8.569">would just back down the second strike</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="7.89">is more comprehensive where the scenario</text>
  <text start="592.699" dur="6.94">says they will go in hit the nuclear</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="6.449">infrastructure and a full-scale war will</text>
  <text start="599.639" dur="5.551">break out so they&amp;#39;re listing all these</text>
  <text start="602.819" dur="5.041">different options of what the US can do</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="5.91">now first of all North Korea hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="5.99">attacked anyone North Korea is not</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="5.489">threatening the United States actually</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="4.929">North Korea wanted to have peace</text>
  <text start="616.589" dur="7.05">negotiations with the United States the</text>
  <text start="618.779" dur="8.011">United States said no instead they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="623.639" dur="6.12">rather provoke actually if you notice</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="5.489">Russia China they&amp;#39;re always talking</text>
  <text start="629.759" dur="5.121">about peace let&amp;#39;s talk about this why do</text>
  <text start="632.279" dur="6">we have to go right to an aggressive</text>
  <text start="634.88" dur="5.889">nature but this is what the United</text>
  <text start="638.279" dur="4.56">States has left because we&amp;#39;re at its</text>
  <text start="640.769" dur="3.661">endgame I&amp;#39;m talking about the elite not</text>
  <text start="642.839" dur="3.031">the people of the United States the</text>
  <text start="644.43" dur="4.649">people in the United States they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="6.839">rather not have war war is devastating</text>
  <text start="649.079" dur="7.74">on families and on people the elite they</text>
  <text start="652.709" dur="8.55">like war brings in a lot of money forces</text>
  <text start="656.819" dur="8.01">their position all over the world and we</text>
  <text start="661.259" dur="8.01">see right now this is what they really</text>
  <text start="664.829" dur="7.401">want they want a war and what the United</text>
  <text start="669.269" dur="6.361">States right now their currency system</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="6.43">well it&amp;#39;s at its endgame this is what</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="6.12">happens to empires when they&amp;#39;re at their</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="4.919">end stage they use force on other</text>
  <text start="681.75" dur="4.529">countries and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="683.579" dur="5.61">right now now it looks like the United</text>
  <text start="686.279" dur="6.87">States and NATO and I should really say</text>
  <text start="689.189" dur="6.601">the elite the elite they&amp;#39;re pushing war</text>

  <text start="1013.99" dur="5.93">looks like something in a video game and</text>

  <text start="1036.04" dur="8.21">administration is 100 percent certain</text>
  <text start="1038.4" dur="12.4">that Russia did play a role in hacking</text>
  <text start="1044.25" dur="8.98">the election system now they did show a</text>
  <text start="1050.8" dur="4.95">document which was something like 13</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="5.49">pages or so it was a PDF and of course</text>
  <text start="1055.75" dur="6.51">we discussed how they left the CSV XML</text>
  <text start="1058.72" dur="6.48">file out of it and to read the XML file</text>
  <text start="1062.26" dur="4.77">you need like an RSS reader or you need</text>
  <text start="1065.2" dur="3.09">to read it in the web browser it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1067.03" dur="2.49">something readily available where</text>
  <text start="1068.29" dur="2.82">someone can just look at it and say well</text>
  <text start="1069.52" dur="3.98">yeah I could see all the different</text>
  <text start="1071.11" dur="5.1">information it seems like they purposely</text>
  <text start="1073.5" dur="4.8">created it in this fashion and left it</text>
  <text start="1076.21" dur="5.25">out so no one would really look at it</text>
  <text start="1078.3" dur="6.76">but we didn&amp;#39;t notice when we did look at</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="5.88">it that 895 IP addresses were listed</text>
  <text start="1085.06" dur="4.98">there from 40 different countries you</text>

  <text start="1090.04" dur="6.09">from Russia and this is what they are</text>
  <text start="1092.41" dur="9.75">using to convince everyone that Russia</text>
  <text start="1096.13" dur="9.66">was responsible in hacking the election</text>
  <text start="1102.16" dur="5.7">system and the DNC now Trump was</text>
  <text start="1105.79" dur="6.42">supposed to have an intelligence</text>
  <text start="1107.86" dur="6.93">briefing and it was delayed until Friday</text>
  <text start="1112.21" dur="3.87">he didn&amp;#39;t delay it the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1114.79" dur="4.859">community</text>
  <text start="1116.08" dur="6.66">to delay this now he&amp;#39;s supposedly going</text>
  <text start="1119.649" dur="5.491">to meet with the CIA director the FBI</text>
  <text start="1122.74" dur="3.929">director and others from the</text>
  <text start="1125.14" dur="4.889">intelligence agencies and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1126.669" dur="5.73">to brief him on what really happened now</text>
  <text start="1130.029" dur="3.471">again we have to look at what has</text>
  <text start="1132.399" dur="3.66">happened here</text>
  <text start="1133.5" dur="4.059">they used the Russian hacking in the</text>
  <text start="1136.059" dur="3.391">beginning Obama came out and said yes</text>
  <text start="1137.559" dur="4.201">Russia has hacked the DNC in the</text>
  <text start="1139.45" dur="4.68">election and if this happens during the</text>
  <text start="1141.76" dur="3.75">election system well we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1144.13" dur="4.23">shut everything down now they really did</text>
  <text start="1145.51" dur="5.039">believe that Trump might have might get</text>
  <text start="1148.36" dur="4.02">the popular vote and if that did happen</text>
  <text start="1150.549" dur="2.97">they were going to use this and they</text>
  <text start="1152.38" dur="2.82">were going to shut down the election</text>
  <text start="1153.519" dur="4.5">system but what happened was their</text>
  <text start="1155.2" dur="4.14">manipulation paid off and Hillary got</text>
  <text start="1158.019" dur="5.4">the popular vote this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1159.34" dur="5.819">reporting to the public now after this</text>
  <text start="1163.419" dur="5.37">they didn&amp;#39;t like that Trump was elected</text>
  <text start="1165.159" dur="5.341">the electors voted him in and they were</text>
  <text start="1168.789" dur="3.781">like okay this cannot stand</text>
  <text start="1170.5" dur="4.049">so we&amp;#39;re going to use the Russian</text>
  <text start="1172.57" dur="6.839">hacking once again to convince the world</text>
  <text start="1174.549" dur="7.98">that this election is null and void so</text>
  <text start="1179.409" dur="4.98">they had Jill Stein do a recount they</text>
  <text start="1182.529" dur="4.291">were going to give an Intel briefing to</text>
  <text start="1184.389" dur="4.231">the electors and all of that fell apart</text>
  <text start="1186.82" dur="3.93">they never briefed the electors and</text>
  <text start="1188.62" dur="4.35">Congress asked for the information and</text>
  <text start="1190.75" dur="4.23">the CIA never presented any of the</text>
  <text start="1192.97" dur="4.439">information in the beginning the FBI and</text>
  <text start="1194.98" dur="6.059">the National Intelligence director said</text>
  <text start="1197.409" dur="5.4">we don&amp;#39;t have any information on this</text>
  <text start="1201.039" dur="3.27">hacking that they&amp;#39;re talking about and</text>
  <text start="1202.809" dur="4.801">then all of a sudden they fell in line</text>
  <text start="1204.309" dur="6.511">and said yes Russia did hack so that was</text>
  <text start="1207.61" dur="6">strange right off the bat then it went a</text>
  <text start="1210.82" dur="5.13">step further where they were saying that</text>
  <text start="1213.61" dur="4.679">Russia also hacked the Vermont</text>
  <text start="1215.95" dur="6.27">electrical grid well it turns out it was</text>
  <text start="1218.289" dur="5.911">a laptop who was belonged to a person</text>
  <text start="1222.22" dur="3.089">that worked for Vermont and it was not</text>
  <text start="1224.2" dur="3.3">attached to the grid</text>
  <text start="1225.309" dur="4.86">The Washington Post put the story out</text>
  <text start="1227.5" dur="6.149">and guess what it was fake</text>
  <text start="1230.169" dur="7.921">they retracted the story and here we are</text>
  <text start="1233.649" dur="7.14">today with this fake documentation with</text>
  <text start="1238.09" dur="5.04">no links or proof I said they were going</text>
  <text start="1240.789" dur="5.25">to come out with IP addresses that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1243.13" dur="5.38">they have systems are probed all the</text>
  <text start="1246.039" dur="4.451">time around the world it</text>
  <text start="1248.51" dur="3.84">doesn&amp;#39;t mean just because an IP address</text>
  <text start="1250.49" dur="3.33">says what country it&amp;#39;s coming from it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1252.35" dur="4.62">actually coming from that country</text>
  <text start="1253.82" dur="4.65">because state actors bounce it off many</text>
  <text start="1256.97" dur="3.42">different servers they use many</text>
  <text start="1258.47" dur="3.57">different devices very difficult to</text>
  <text start="1260.39" dur="4.68">track down but they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="1262.04" dur="6.14">proof they want the propaganda out there</text>
  <text start="1265.07" dur="5.64">on purpose why why do they want this</text>
  <text start="1268.18" dur="5.86">because they&amp;#39;re going for a lights-out</text>
  <text start="1270.71" dur="10.07">scenario now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="1274.04" dur="10.89">that out in Canada Ontario power utility</text>
  <text start="1280.78" dur="7.57">came out and it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="1284.93" dur="7.85">news saying that Russia is linked to</text>
  <text start="1288.35" dur="8.04">hacking the electricity distributor and</text>
  <text start="1292.78" dur="4.66">it is linked back to Russia now Russia</text>
  <text start="1296.39" dur="1.56">is saying we don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1297.44" dur="2.97">talking about</text>
  <text start="1297.95" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re not hacking anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1300.41" dur="4.65">saying an IP address at Hydra 1 was</text>
  <text start="1303.2" dur="4.98">among hundreds of malicious addresses</text>
  <text start="1305.06" dur="5.28">and it&amp;#39;s definitely Russia so here we</text>
  <text start="1308.18" dur="3.66">have two different cases where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1310.34" dur="4.08">saying that Russia is hacking the</text>
  <text start="1311.84" dur="5.22">electrical grid now we have to go back</text>
  <text start="1314.42" dur="5.64">in time for a second Janet Napolitano</text>
  <text start="1317.06" dur="5.91">from DHS when she was leaving office she</text>
  <text start="1320.06" dur="5.55">said it&amp;#39;s not if but when we are cyber</text>
  <text start="1322.97" dur="5.7">attacked they had this all planned from</text>
  <text start="1325.61" dur="4.5">the beginning now it might not be</text>
  <text start="1328.67" dur="3.3">playing out the way they had it planned</text>
  <text start="1330.11" dur="3.33">but their goals rose the same and we</text>
  <text start="1331.97" dur="3.86">know these elite the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1333.44" dur="5.52">they always like to meet their goals and</text>
  <text start="1335.83" dur="6.58">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1338.96" dur="4.68">going for it all they&amp;#39;re making the case</text>
  <text start="1342.41" dur="3.93">and there&amp;#39;s only one reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1343.64" dur="5.58">doing this they are planning to bring</text>
  <text start="1346.34" dur="4.62">down the electrical grid 2003 was a test</text>
  <text start="1349.22" dur="3.24">to see if they can bring down the East</text>
  <text start="1350.96" dur="2.76">Coast now they&amp;#39;re not going to shut down</text>
  <text start="1352.46" dur="4.77">the electric in the entire country</text>
  <text start="1353.72" dur="5.52">because that wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense because</text>
  <text start="1357.23" dur="3.81">they couldn&amp;#39;t get their news out to let</text>
  <text start="1359.24" dur="5.43">you know what&amp;#39;s happening but what they</text>

  <text start="1364.67" dur="7.14">areas to make it look like Russia is</text>
  <text start="1368.66" dur="5.25">actually hacking now has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="1371.81" dur="4.89">with proof has nothing to do with</text>
