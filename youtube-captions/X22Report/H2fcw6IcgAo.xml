  <text start="84.47" dur="4.41">happening right now and home Capital</text>

  <text start="93.04" dur="6.939">94% of the funds in the past six weeks</text>

  <text start="99.979" dur="7.17">about like two billion dollars or so</text>
  <text start="102.91" dur="7.54">going back to March now they have a</text>

  <text start="122.899" dur="4.47">you think this is the only company</text>
  <text start="124.67" dur="5.789">that&amp;#39;s having a problem like this I mean</text>
  <text start="127.369" dur="7.911">think about 2007 going into 2008 going</text>
  <text start="130.459" dur="8.191">into 2009 was it just Bear Stearns no</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="5.92">this is going to be a domino effect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="4.199">going to hit many more companies think</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="4.98">about when this housing bubble</text>
  <text start="142.849" dur="6.691">completely pops it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="146.18" dur="5.85">complete disaster because remember the</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="5.46">whole housing market was pumped up into</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="5.55">a gigantic housing bubble remember how</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.47">they did it investment companies hedge</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="4.129">funds they purchased thousands and</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.739">thousands of houses they held on to them</text>
  <text start="161.709" dur="5.5">they bought them very inexpensive right</text>
  <text start="164.209" dur="6.36">after 2008 crisis they held onto them</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="6.03">and they created this bubble because</text>
  <text start="170.569" dur="4.92">they were instructed from the Fed the</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="4.021">whole plan was to create the bubble hold</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="4.531">on to all these houses buy them very</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="4.679">inexpensive sell them off later on this</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="3.59">is how bubbles work and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="181.939" dur="4.081">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="183.61" dur="4.99">Thanks we&amp;#39;re told to</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="3.75">hold on to the foreclosures do not put</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="4.02">them on the market</text>
  <text start="189.77" dur="5.52">why because less houses on the market</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="4.5">drives the prices up and they needed to</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="3.45">do this in certain cities they could do</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="3.84">it through the whole country this is why</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="5.25">the whole country didn&amp;#39;t really perform</text>
  <text start="200.96" dur="5.46">like these 20 cities and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.99" dur="3.78">starting to see it all break down but</text>
  <text start="206.42" dur="3.42">people are still out there</text>
  <text start="207.77" dur="4.71">and according to you Mitch they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="4.56">confident about what is happening even</text>
  <text start="212.48" dur="3.57">though there&amp;#39;s reports coming out saying</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="3.36">that retail stores in just the beginning</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="2.94">of this year thirty five hundred stores</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="2.55">are going to be closing projecting it</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="3.09">out to the end of this year we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="4.95">have about eight thousand plus stores</text>
  <text start="222.08" dur="4.77">closing fifty bankruptcies the housing</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="2.34">market and I&amp;#39;ve been looking around all</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="3.03">over the place</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="4.95">houses are on the market longer and</text>
  <text start="229.88" dur="4.2">longer and longer and when people were</text>
  <text start="232.55" dur="3.72">asked a question you know what do you</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="4.44">think about homes and home buying they</text>
  <text start="236.27" dur="4.82">all of them are saying or are out there</text>
  <text start="238.52" dur="6.72">right now saying this is a great time to</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="7.92">sell a home yes this is how it works</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="7.46">when the bubble is at the height at the</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="6.46">point where it can&amp;#39;t go any higher</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="5.68">people believe and this is done on</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="5.7">purpose that this is the time to sell</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="6.63">the home and then purchase another home</text>
  <text start="261.17" dur="6.87">and what they find out is that no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="5.73">coming around anymore because by the</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="4.59">time they start to sell by the time they</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="4.41">go out and they start doing things we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="4.62">heading down the other way traffic dries</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.97">up and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="7.44">now retail sales just like we expected</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="6.03">well they came in pretty darn bad retail</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="5.13">sales miss across the board now remember</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been living in this illusion what</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="4.68">do I mean by illusion numbers are</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="4.14">manipulated at this point in time</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="3.78">everyone realizes that unemployment is</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="3.87">manipulated we discussed this many many</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="3.93">times before we talked about retail</text>
  <text start="300.2" dur="4.17">sales now when we look at the retail</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.85">sales numbers and we discussed how</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="6.51">retail sales work they&amp;#39;re coming up with</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="5.76">retail sales they&amp;#39;re up by 0.4 percent</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="5.49">they missed the expectations by 0.6</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="4.92">percent now we know that all these</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="3.12">stores are closing I mean I go to the</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="2.489">mall I</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="3.63">see like pay less you know going out of</text>
  <text start="321.229" dur="3.481">business and things like that</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="5.19">we know the Sports Authority closed down</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="4.82">remember how they work with the stores</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="4.71">that are closing</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="5.919">once the stores closed they don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="5.28">say okay we&amp;#39;re done with the sales with</text>
  <text start="335.449" dur="6.9">this store they project it out for many</text>
  <text start="338.3" dur="6.239">months into the year so it doesn&amp;#39;t hit</text>
  <text start="342.349" dur="4.801">the economy that bad even though in</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="3.301">reality that store is not selling</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="3.21">anymore</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="6.21">so when we look at these numbers are</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="6.899">they really true or is it a lot worse</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="6.83">than what they are saying we know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="357.259" dur="5.63">lot worse I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="6.45">3,500 stores</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="7.03">we&amp;#39;re going to hit 50 bankruptcies</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="4.39">JCPenney Macy&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re all saying that</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="4.201">they have to close many more stores</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.819">which means more people are being laid</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="6.6">off we have been kept in an illusion and</text>
  <text start="377.539" dur="6.241">the illusion is still here but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="4.439">breaking apart people are starting to</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="3.33">realize well blame it I&amp;#39;m going to the</text>
  <text start="385.159" dur="3.57">store that&amp;#39;s closed this is closed the</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="3.779">anchor store is gone what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="388.729" dur="3.75">here how is this recovery aren&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="390.889" dur="2.851">supposed to be expanding and then of</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="2.881">course the corporate media well it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="3.72">going to online sales yeah that&amp;#39;s eight</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="4.5">point six three percent of total retail</text>
  <text start="397.46" dur="5.009">sales I don&amp;#39;t care if it goes up thirty</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="6.809">percent it&amp;#39;s only thirty percent of the</text>
  <text start="402.469" dur="5.641">eight percent who cares but when we look</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="4.141">at this we can see what&amp;#39;s up and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="6.589">that furniture and home furnishing</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="6">stores down negative point five percent</text>

  <text start="429.28" dur="4.84">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.18">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of negative numbers</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="5.639">now even the numbers that are positive</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="6.15">like motor vehicle 0.7% electronics</text>
  <text start="439.759" dur="4.351">which are 1.3 percent you have to</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="5.58">remember they&amp;#39;re still counting those</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="5.01">stores even though they&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="447.44" dur="4.08">business even though a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="3.93">have closed already they didn&amp;#39;t just cut</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.09">them off so we</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.25">these numbers are completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="6.45">and false now the Trump administration</text>

  <text start="485.65" dur="4.69">long GMO a lot of chemicals in the foods</text>
  <text start="488.599" dur="4.711">but that&amp;#39;s for a whole different</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="5.579">discussion we also see that they agreed</text>
  <text start="493.31" dur="5.82">to begin exporting us liquefied natural</text>
  <text start="495.919" dur="4.5">gas to China and Beijing will also</text>

  <text start="505.52" dur="3.329">important because we need to go back a</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="3.66">little bit in time here to one of the</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="5.55">reports that I did that I said that the</text>

  <text start="517.669" dur="6.091">need to establish trade and something</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="4.8">very very important came out of this and</text>
  <text start="523.76" dur="3.81">of course the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="525.529" dur="3.721">didn&amp;#39;t pick up on it they&amp;#39;re too busy oh</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s right with a nonsense of Comey</text>
  <text start="529.25" dur="4.86">and Trump is keeping them very very busy</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="5.279">with that the Department of Commerce</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="5.82">said that Washington had also agreed to</text>

  <text start="574.399" dur="8.101">have it right now so we can see that</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="7.29">things are being put into place now we</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="4.29">know that this economy is actually</text>
  <text start="585.02" dur="5.16">getting worse and</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="5.669">as time goes on and we know that one of</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="3.75">the tools that Trump has and people are</text>
  <text start="592.459" dur="3.451">writing in all different tools that he</text>

  <text start="805.38" dur="5.67">support the debt now we talked about</text>
  <text start="809.13" dur="4.47">this before and this was just a</text>
  <text start="811.05" dur="3.93">suggestion at that time during this</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="3.96">period of time they thought they were</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="4.5">going to have a carbon tax where they</text>

  <text start="826.92" dur="4.5">paying down the debt that&amp;#39;s what it was</text>
  <text start="828.96" dur="5.4">really going to be used for so instead</text>
  <text start="831.42" dur="6.21">of the carbon tax because that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="834.36" dur="5.28">nowhere right now they said okay</text>
  <text start="837.63" dur="6.39">remember when we talked about the 10%</text>
  <text start="839.64" dur="7.14">tax on all money in the banks all the</text>
  <text start="844.02" dur="6.21">deposits in the banks throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="846.78" dur="5.91">well we need to do that now and what</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="4.03">they want to do is exactly what Italy</text>
  <text start="852.69" dur="4.46">has done years ago</text>
  <text start="854.26" dur="5.59">Italy simply imposed a tax on money in</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="6.15">one&amp;#39;s account this was called a capital</text>
  <text start="859.85" dur="6.05">levy this was a one-time charge as in it</text>
  <text start="863.3" dur="6.06">as an exceptional measure to restore the</text>
  <text start="865.9" dur="5.95">sustainability of the debt the IMF right</text>
  <text start="869.36" dur="5.97">now is suggesting that measure be</text>
  <text start="871.85" dur="7.17">invoked to help the coming sovereign</text>
  <text start="875.33" dur="6.63">debt crisis they have already calculated</text>
  <text start="879.02" dur="6.18">how much the measure would cost every</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="4.47">eurozone citizen the amount of the tax</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="5.04">would have to bring the European</text>
  <text start="886.43" dur="8.34">sovereign-debt back to the pre-crisis</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="8.61">level before 2008 so right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="894.77" dur="7.35">looking at a 10 percent tax on those</text>
  <text start="898.85" dur="5.99">people&amp;#39;s bank accounts and they want to</text>
  <text start="902.12" dur="5.61">do this as quickly as possible</text>
  <text start="904.84" dur="5.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the endgame here</text>
  <text start="907.73" dur="4.86">people we already have JPMorgan Chase</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="5.07">out there saying listen we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="912.59" dur="5.07">have a drain on deposits come the end of</text>
  <text start="915.44" dur="5.57">this year the IMF is looking to put a</text>
  <text start="917.66" dur="6.03">10% tax they&amp;#39;re not waiting they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="921.01" dur="5.41">suggesting this they&amp;#39;re already putting</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="6.09">this plan in motion</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;ve already calculated how much each</text>
  <text start="929.78" dur="4.95">person&amp;#39;s going to give they already know</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="4.86">how much everyone has in their account</text>
  <text start="934.73" dur="4.8">they already know what the banks need to</text>
  <text start="937.73" dur="4.41">do because all they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="939.53" dur="6.69">siphon it out of the banks click of a</text>
  <text start="942.14" dur="6.48">button boom it&amp;#39;s gone 10% so we can see</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="4.8">that the central banks right now the end</text>
  <text start="948.62" dur="5.34">game is to siphon off as much as they</text>
  <text start="951.02" dur="5.04">possibly can to take as much as they</text>
  <text start="953.96" dur="3.42">possibly can and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.06" dur="3.86">doing right now this is what always</text>
  <text start="957.38" dur="4.62">happens when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="4.12">because they&amp;#39;re hoping to bring the</text>
  <text start="962" dur="4.59">system down think about it they can</text>
  <text start="964.04" dur="4.71">siphon all this debt I mean all this</text>

  <text start="986.06" dur="4.65">anything right now and</text>
  <text start="987.71" dur="6.39">is how they&amp;#39;re going to go forward this</text>
  <text start="990.71" dur="6.33">is their crash scenario where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.1" dur="6.96">going to crash the system and keep their</text>
