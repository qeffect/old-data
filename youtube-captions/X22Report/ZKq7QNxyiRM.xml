  <text start="143.4" dur="3.96">gauge of the economy and there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="4.62">economic indicators that go into this</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="8.13">the economy for all intents purposes it</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="11.24">is already collapsed we are already in a</text>
  <text start="155.49" dur="8.09">deep deep depression the stock market is</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="5.7">the last thing</text>
  <text start="163.58" dur="7.2">that the entire world looks at because</text>
  <text start="167.06" dur="5.79">it reflects on the corporation&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.41">reflects on the US government it</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="7.14">reflects on the central bankers and if</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="8.01">this is still up in a good range people</text>
  <text start="179.99" dur="5.91">feel that everything is fine and this is</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="7.35">furthest from the truth things are not</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="7.65">fine basically everything has been</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="6.45">happening and what&amp;#39;s happening now is</text>
  <text start="193.55" dur="6.27">the collapse is accelerating it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="197" dur="4.29">slowing down this is a warning shot do I</text>
  <text start="199.82" dur="3.24">believe there&amp;#39;s going to be collapse on</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="4.41">Monday no I think what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="4.47">now things are rapidly falling apart I</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="4.44">think the plunge protection team the</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="5.37">high-frequency traders didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="210.14" dur="4.77">this they didn&amp;#39;t have enough funds to</text>
  <text start="212.9" dur="5.07">pump this up they tried it as best they</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="5.43">possibly could and as Monday rolls</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="4.08">around we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="220.34" dur="3.45">happen but we know the Asian markets do</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="2.85">open first then it goes to the European</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="4.43">markets and we can see how they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.16">to judge and get some type of</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="5.14">understanding of what the market is</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="5.01">going to do on Tuesday but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="3.33">strange is normally on a Friday they</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="3.27">give us a happy ending making us feel</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="4.47">good even if they can get it one point</text>
  <text start="238.34" dur="5.19">into the green they&amp;#39;re happy with that</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="5.359">and at this point we&amp;#39;re going into a</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="6.56">three-day weekend where it is completely</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="6.881">horrific now UBS is out there and</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="7.679">they&amp;#39;re saying equities are now rolling</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="6.72">over everyone should start buying gold</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="7.781">they&amp;#39;re saying that the seven-year cycle</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="7.38">in equities is done it&amp;#39;s rolling over we</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="3.679">could see a sharp thirty to forty</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="6.69">percent correction in the stock market</text>
  <text start="269.229" dur="10.781">it&amp;#39;s time to buy gold and all of a</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="10.19">sudden we see gold increase now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="7.58">getting information from retail that</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="7.599">retail sales during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="6.76">were horrific and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="5.631">more and more layoffs well for Wells</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="7.55">Fargo is laying off 121 in there I</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="7.77">department zoosk is laying off 40 people</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="9.36">GoPro is laying off a hundred Walmart is</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="9.03">going to fire 10,000 people in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="12.21">16,000 total they&amp;#39;re going to be closing</text>
  <text start="314.41" dur="11.32">300 stores I mean this is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="6.06">more than ninety-five percent of the</text>
  <text start="325.73" dur="7.77">clothes stores are going to be in the US</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="6.13">now if the retail industry was doing as</text>
  <text start="333.5" dur="5.34">well as they all want us to believe we</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="5.88">wouldn&amp;#39;t be seeing store closures of</text>
  <text start="338.84" dur="7.11">this magnitude actually we would see an</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="6.66">expansion of retail because the</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="4.5">government and president obama and the</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="5.76">central bankers are telling us that</text>
  <text start="350.45" dur="8.13">unemployment is at five percent we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="7.92">almost near full recovery in the</text>
  <text start="358.58" dur="5.91">unemployment market so how in the world</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="6.45">is no one spending their money because</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s a lie and we&amp;#39;re seeing that retails</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="7.02">printed at negative point one in</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="7.77">December and this is the weakest year</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="8.85">since 2009 and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="378.53" dur="13.02">retail sales year-on-year we are back</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="12.84">where we were in 2008 and if you look at</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="8.04">the graph we&amp;#39;re right at that point now</text>
  <text start="397.04" dur="6.2">parts of the retail industry did</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="5.55">absolutely terrible we look at</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="5.35">electronics and appliance source</text>
  <text start="405.14" dur="6.38">negative point two percent down food and</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="5.97">beverage stores negative 0.3% down</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="6.79">clothing down negative point nine</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="6.39">percent we&amp;#39;re looking at health I mean</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="5.52">gas stations are down negative 1 point 1</text>
  <text start="420.95" dur="5.76">general merchandise stores down negative</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="6.32">1 miscellaneous store retailers down</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="3.44">negative 2 and</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="6.57">what we are seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="4.89">holiday season where most of these</text>
  <text start="437.39" dur="4.92">stores well I would say almost all of</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="5.01">them depend on sales during the holiday</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="6.9">season to make it through the rest of</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="7.71">the year and it just didn&amp;#39;t happen so</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="4.53">what does this mean it means if they</text>
  <text start="451.97" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t bring in the sales they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="4.83">have the revenue which means they need</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="4.68">to close stores this is what we are</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="4.41">seeing right now if they closed stores</text>
  <text start="460.88" dur="4.98">are going to have to lay off more people</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="5.61">wear again are they going to find these</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="6.09">jobs if all these retail stores are</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="7.5">closing they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="6.21">find a job and then we will see initial</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="4.2">jobless claims rise now of course those</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="4.74">people working in part time jobs and</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re working under I think it&amp;#39;s 25 or</text>
  <text start="482.9" dur="5.76">30 hours they will not be able to apply</text>
  <text start="485.27" dur="5.19">for this but we are going to see more</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="3.6">and more people who are in management</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="4.47">apply for this we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="4.2">corporations because the stock market is</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="2.88">taking a dive and these companies really</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t have revenue coming in because</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="5.61">they don&amp;#39;t have the sales like</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="8.52">caterpillar IBM they have down sales for</text>
  <text start="503.42" dur="8.96">what the last 36 months the whole thing</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="8.54">is falling apart industrial production</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="6.94">came in at a negative point four percent</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="6.01">November don&amp;#39;t tell anyone was revised</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="7.23">lower from negative point six to</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="5.7">negative point nine but of course the</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="4.68">corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t tell you about</text>
  <text start="527.96" dur="9.21">that and they blame this all on the</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="8.94">weather so basically out of the 10 the</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="7.53">last 12 months I should say there were</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="7.1">10 months that had bad weather because</text>
  <text start="544.7" dur="7.11">industrial production has been</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="7.45">contracting for the last 10 so we know</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s not the weather I&amp;#39;m going to say</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s the economy I&amp;#39;m going to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="4.8">this fake economy I&amp;#39;m going to say is</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="5.909">this bubble economy that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="6.389">government central bankers created</text>
  <text start="564.649" dur="6.75">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="567.889" dur="7.07">its toll on us trucking us trucking</text>
  <text start="571.399" dur="14.24">right now has hit an all-time new low</text>
  <text start="574.959" dur="10.68">we&amp;#39;re right back to 2009 stats basically</text>
  <text start="585.939" dur="10.09">trucking right now is coming to a halt</text>
  <text start="589.209" dur="8.38">for deliveries rail traffic is coming to</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="3.99">a halt and I don&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s stopping</text>
  <text start="597.589" dur="7.581">physically I mean the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="600.019" dur="10.11">just falling apart and the volume is</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="8.32">collapsing and we can see why we can see</text>
  <text start="610.129" dur="7.07">that deliveries are not needed because</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s no demand from the people</text>
  <text start="617.199" dur="5.05">because the people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="4.56">so if people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they</text>
  <text start="622.249" dur="4.051">don&amp;#39;t have the extra disposable income</text>
  <text start="624.11" dur="4.019">to go out and spend in retail if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="3.479">not going to spend in retail stores are</text>
  <text start="628.129" dur="4.95">going to contract people are going to be</text>
  <text start="629.779" dur="7.23">laid off which then feeds the Munster</text>
  <text start="633.079" dur="6.18">and more people don&amp;#39;t have the funds so</text>
  <text start="637.009" dur="5.82">if there&amp;#39;s no demand in retail rail</text>
  <text start="639.259" dur="5.49">delivery truck delivery the volume is</text>
  <text start="642.829" dur="4.98">going to collapse if the volume</text>
  <text start="644.749" dur="5.46">collapses their manufacturers factories</text>
  <text start="647.809" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t have to produce if manufacturers</text>
  <text start="650.209" dur="3.87">factories don&amp;#39;t have to produce they</text>
  <text start="652.249" dur="5.991">don&amp;#39;t have to order the raw material the</text>
  <text start="654.079" dur="7.73">bolt of dry index continually drops and</text>
  <text start="658.24" dur="7.089">that is what we&amp;#39;re seeing we are seeing</text>
  <text start="661.809" dur="7.27">everything fall apart the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="665.329" dur="10.411">Index right now fell once again another</text>
  <text start="669.079" dur="11.641">10 points it is down to 373 as we look</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="8.37">at hotel inventory to sales ratio well</text>
  <text start="680.72" dur="5.909">that is flashing a recessionary signal</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="7.019">and business inventories to sales point</text>
  <text start="686.629" dur="9.981">is doing the same exact thing it is</text>
  <text start="691.129" dur="7.441">heading into an inventory dump recession</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="4.78">the ratio is</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="4.86">highest since the last crisis as both</text>
  <text start="701.39" dur="8.13">sales and inventories fell month on</text>
  <text start="703.43" dur="11.4">month and it is absolutely awful the</text>
  <text start="709.52" dur="8.49">Empire fed is crashing at its fastest</text>
  <text start="714.83" dur="7.08">pace since Lehman right now it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="718.01" dur="6.54">negative nineteen point three seven this</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="4.61">is the largest miss on record new orders</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="4.05">have collapsed shipments plunged</text>
  <text start="726.52" dur="6.64">employees in work we continued to</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="7.53">contract so the last time the Empire Fed</text>
  <text start="733.16" dur="5.46">crashed to these levels was right after</text>
  <text start="736.13" dur="11.34">the lehman bankruptcy and the global</text>
  <text start="738.62" dur="14.58">financial crisis in 2001 so during 2001</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="7.65">and during 2008 we&amp;#39;ve seen this but the</text>
  <text start="753.2" dur="5.07">president continually tells us the</text>
  <text start="755.12" dur="6.81">economy strong so why are we seeing all</text>
  <text start="758.27" dur="8.55">these economic indicators pointing to a</text>
  <text start="761.93" dur="9.63">collapse something&amp;#39;s wrong here someone</text>
  <text start="766.82" dur="9.42">is not telling the truth and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="771.56" dur="7.11">government it&amp;#39;s the central bank now</text>
  <text start="776.24" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s very interesting in Business</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="4.98">Insider they had an article that said</text>
  <text start="781.34" dur="6.48">millions of Americans feel like the</text>
  <text start="783.65" dur="7.8">recession never ended well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="787.82" dur="5.46">because it hasn&amp;#39;t basically what they</text>
  <text start="791.45" dur="6.29">did was they created an illusionary</text>
  <text start="793.28" dur="8.58">recovery but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="797.74" dur="6.85">93% of counties in the US are still</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="7.38">struggling to recover from that Great</text>
  <text start="804.59" dur="9.18">Recession and this shows us that we</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="8.37">never came out of it we are put into</text>
  <text start="813.77" dur="6.69">this drug induced illusion that we were</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="5.79">in this recovery and this is why the</text>
  <text start="820.46" dur="5.81">president is out there saying you need</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="5.52">to believe me because the truth is is</text>
  <text start="826.27" dur="4.54">that this whole thing is coming apart</text>
  <text start="828.92" dur="3.419">and falling apart and collapsing just</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="3.899">like in 2008</text>
  <text start="832.339" dur="4.771">when they told us the subprime is</text>
  <text start="834.709" dur="5.701">contained housing prices can&amp;#39;t go down</text>
  <text start="837.11" dur="6.3">that&amp;#39;s impossible we&amp;#39;re not forecasting</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="6.27">a recession any time this year all you</text>
  <text start="843.41" dur="5.969">people are crazy you crazy conspiracy</text>
  <text start="846.68" dur="4.199">theorists and what happened during the</text>
  <text start="849.379" dur="5.341">same year they told us all this the</text>
  <text start="850.879" dur="5.791">whole thing came crashing down well</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="5.099">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="856.67" dur="5.519">Atlanta Fed waited until the close of</text>
  <text start="859.819" dur="4.861">today after the terrible stock market</text>
  <text start="862.189" dur="4.861">performance to reveal that the fourth</text>
  <text start="864.68" dur="7.589">quarter GDP is going to be more like</text>
  <text start="867.05" dur="7.469">point six percent I mean it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="872.269" dur="3.661">awful of what&amp;#39;s going on right now now</text>
  <text start="874.519" dur="5.87">of course the Fed is out there telling</text>
  <text start="875.93" dur="7.529">us listen if the economy weakens further</text>
  <text start="880.389" dur="6.76">we will go back to zero interest rates</text>
  <text start="883.459" dur="5.61">and we will implement qe4 only if the</text>
  <text start="887.149" dur="3.3">economy does is but we&amp;#39;re looking at it</text>
  <text start="889.069" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the economy is</text>
  <text start="890.449" dur="6.211">still strong so they&amp;#39;re letting you know</text>
  <text start="893.749" dur="4.53">now of course they&amp;#39;re not going to just</text>
  <text start="896.66" dur="3.089">let the market to you know fall apart</text>
  <text start="898.279" dur="4.11">because everyone will look at them</text>
  <text start="899.749" dur="5.851">saying okay one month ago you told us</text>
  <text start="902.389" dur="5.851">the economy is strong you increase the</text>
  <text start="905.6" dur="4.529">Fed fund rate the president came out and</text>
  <text start="908.24" dur="7.17">told everyone you&amp;#39;re crazy for believing</text>
  <text start="910.129" dur="6.96">the economy is doing terribly and now</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;re telling us if the economy is</text>
  <text start="917.089" dur="5.79">going to deteriorate you are going to go</text>
  <text start="920.54" dur="4.139">back to zero and might even start up qe4</text>
  <text start="922.879" dur="4.77">so they&amp;#39;re not just going to let this</text>
  <text start="924.679" dur="4.83">happen because their plan is to blame it</text>
  <text start="927.649" dur="5.581">on another group or country and that is</text>
  <text start="929.509" dur="6.031">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing Ron Paul is</text>
  <text start="933.23" dur="4.799">out there he&amp;#39;s saying watch the petro</text>
  <text start="935.54" dur="4.889">dollar and he&amp;#39;s telling you what to</text>
  <text start="938.029" dur="4.381">watch for he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="940.429" dur="5.491">geopolitical sands of the Middle East</text>
  <text start="942.41" dur="7.01">are rapidly shifting and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="945.92" dur="6.359">strategic regional position is weakening</text>
  <text start="949.42" dur="6.209">Iran which is notably not part of the</text>
  <text start="952.279" dur="6.511">petro dollar system is now on the rise</text>
  <text start="955.629" dur="5.591">the sanctions are going to be removed in</text>
  <text start="958.79" dur="4.469">a couple of days and like I said this</text>
  <text start="961.22" dur="3.719">whole thing was not about nuclear</text>
  <text start="963.259" dur="2.581">weapons this is why John Kerry slipped</text>
  <text start="964.939" dur="2.431">up and said</text>
  <text start="965.84" dur="3.33">we don&amp;#39;t make this deal with Iran the</text>
  <text start="967.37" dur="3.9">dollar is going to collapse because</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re not on the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="971.27" dur="5.4">they want to put a rant on the petro</text>
  <text start="973.97" dur="8.94">dollar system to keep this system alive</text>
  <text start="976.67" dur="8.45">and we can see right now Ron Paul saying</text>
  <text start="982.91" dur="5.19">that the emerging bric countries are</text>
  <text start="985.12" dur="4.6">creating potential alternatives to the</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="5.43">u.s. dominated economic security</text>
  <text start="989.72" dur="8.01">arrangements and this is going to impact</text>
  <text start="993.53" dur="6.12">the petrodollar and we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="997.73" dur="4.65">to watch what happens in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="999.65" dur="4.08">what happens in Iran and what happened</text>
  <text start="1002.38" dur="4.02">to the petro dollar because this will</text>
  <text start="1003.73" dur="4.79">give you a signal of when things are</text>
  <text start="1006.4" dur="4.65">going to start to rapidly fall apart and</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="5.29">we need to watch this you need to be</text>
  <text start="1011.05" dur="5.22">prepared because things are going to</text>
  <text start="1013.81" dur="4.5">accelerate at this point so everyone</text>
