  <text start="103.9" dur="6.06">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="6.78">talking about how the EU doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="109.96" dur="4.83">the UK to exit and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="5.19">whatever they possibly can to keep them</text>
  <text start="114.79" dur="5.82">in the EU now there has been a report</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="5.84">that has been revealed and it&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="6.15">that Germany will do anything to stop</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="5.98">Britain&amp;#39;s hard brexit from the European</text>
  <text start="126.76" dur="5.82">Union and this new study has revealed</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="3.9">the reason why now what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="3.42">this is coming from the Cologne</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="7.11">Institute of for economic research and</text>
  <text start="136" dur="9.269">they revealed that if the UK leaves the</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="6.33">EU Germany could face economic disaster</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="3.811">following the brexit now according to</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="4.02">the study many German manufacturers are</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="4.83">dependent on the production of goods</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="6">abroad with many partners being based in</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="5.79">Britain from 2014 alone the British</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="5.22">supplied immediate goods worth about 200</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="5.94">billion euros to the EU of which 36</text>
  <text start="162.61" dur="6.57">billion went to Germany so this is a</text>
  <text start="165.64" dur="4.89">problem for Germany right now and we</text>
  <text start="169.18" dur="4.89">could see they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="5.82">possibly can to stop a hard brexit now</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="4.5">we see the EU they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="4.38">agenda to stop what is going on Germany</text>
  <text start="178.57" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen and I could</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="6.87">see why they are trying to push and make</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="6.54">the UK pay a punishment penalty and they</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="5.94">keep raising it and raising it trying to</text>
  <text start="190.27" dur="4.5">make them stay in the EU and again they</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="3.3">haven&amp;#39;t agreed on anything</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="4.25">it looks like insults are just flying</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="5.13">back and forth and nothing has been done</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="5.95">we see Jamin Jamie Dimon is out there</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="7.04">from JPMorgan Chase and he is saying</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="8.34">that bitcoin is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="7.27">fraud and if anyone in his company is</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.28">trading it he&amp;#39;s going to fire them he</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="5.49">basically says that this is almost the</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="5.34">same thing as the tulip mania the only</text>
  <text start="221.77" dur="3.78">difference is not many people are</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="3.96">trading in Bitcoin if you look at the</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="5.37">entire population it is a very very</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="5.25">small percentage and what we see really</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="4.47">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="4.14">nervous about crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="3.93">very worried about the blockchain we</text>
  <text start="237.28" dur="5.4">know that they are trying to control the</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="4.71">blockchain and at this point we could</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="4.65">see that he is trying to convince</text>
  <text start="244.03" dur="6.45">everyone that this is something that you</text>
  <text start="247.33" dur="4.5">shouldn&amp;#39;t be in and Bitcoin did drop</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="3.87">down a little bit now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="251.83" dur="5.1">interesting is this isn&amp;#39;t the first time</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="4.889">Jamie Dimon has lashed out at Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="5.22">the last time he slammed Bitcoin was</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="4.711">around November of 2015 at the Fortune</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="4.08">Global Forum in San Francisco and he</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="5.49">said the following you&amp;#39;re wasting your</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="5.52">time with Bitcoin virtual currency where</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s called a Bitcoin verse a US dollar</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s going to be stopped said diamond</text>
  <text start="273.73" dur="3.99">no government will ever support a</text>
  <text start="275.89" dur="3.48">virtual currency that goes around</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.38">borders and doesn&amp;#39;t have the same</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="4.82">controls it&amp;#39;s not going to happen well</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="4.53">very interestingly it is happening</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.38">blockchain is like any other technology</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.07">if it is cheaper effective works and</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="3.99">secure then we&amp;#39;re going to use it the</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="4.14">technology will be used and it could be</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="7.83">used to transport currency but it will</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="7.59">be dollars not bitcoins now we know that</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="5.25">to steer people away from the crypto</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="3.57">market just like they tried to steer</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="3.75">everyone away from the gold market where</text>
  <text start="310.48" dur="4.28">they say it&amp;#39;s a barbarous relic you</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t really need it you know just a</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="5.469">shiny piece of yellow metal it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="4.04">really important that dollar is actually</text>
  <text start="320.229" dur="3.861">the currency</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="4.56">and we&amp;#39;ve come to find out that well the</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="4.17">paper and ink is just that paper and ink</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s worth absolutely nothing because</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="5.19">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing happen around the</text>
  <text start="330.42" dur="5.73">world is that every single country has</text>
  <text start="333.45" dur="4.68">been put into debt and there is currency</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.11">which is being created because of</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="4.68">stimulus like crazy and when you add</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="5.61">more and more currency guess what</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="4.38">happens it D values the dollar actually</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="4.02">Bitcoin and many of the other</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="5.55">cryptocurrencies they have a cap so you</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t even go above that same thing with</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="5.31">gold silver very difficult to find and</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="5.1">there is some sort of you know checks</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="5.07">and balances but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="6.68">about all this since he made those</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="7.41">statements back in 2015 bitcoin is up by</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="6.07">1018 percent and we could see at this</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="5.19">point he is trying to drive people and</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.15">send the message out there that everyone</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="5.28">should steer clear of the blockchain</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="5.74">market and this is what he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="381" dur="6.27">do we see right now that the August</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="5.25">producer prices well they have risen a</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="5.61">little bit and this is on gasoline and</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.45">right now the inflation mark right now</text>
  <text start="392.88" dur="5.4">is still very very low we know that the</text>
  <text start="396" dur="4.47">Fed has been shipping inflation off but</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="3.93">to overseas into the stock market into</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="4.2">the housing market and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="4.41">and if you really look at what is going</text>
  <text start="404.67" dur="3.3">on and you can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="3.69">like in the supermarket&amp;#39;s with real</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="4.38">fresh food you can see that prices have</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="4.29">definitely increased houses have</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="4.17">definitely increased in price tuition in</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="4.74">colleges have definitely increased in</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="4.62">price the stock market has gone up this</text>
  <text start="419.34" dur="4.68">is all inflation this is where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="5.79">sending the inflation so we can see</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="4.32">right now that even though the Fed is</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="3.6">telling us that there is no inflation</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.5">that we had a little bump up because of</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="4.17">gasoline prices moving up inflation is a</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="4.14">lot worse that they&amp;#39;re really saying and</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="4.38">of course once all the dollars come back</text>
  <text start="436.98" dur="3.3">to the United States and the dollar is</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="3.18">devalued because there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="5.52">currency in circulation we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="442.26" dur="5.94">inflation go completely crazy now</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="3.9">Charles Hugh Smith was out there and he</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="3.719">has been talking about the housing</text>
  <text start="449.7" dur="4.32">market and he is saying that you know</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="3.511">something every time we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="4.14">housing market</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="5.94">do what it&amp;#39;s doing right now it ends up</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="7.02">in a crash now he created this chart and</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="5.88">he tracked the other bubbles previous</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="3.92">bubbles to the one that were in now and</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="6.06">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="7">symmetry of the expansion the collapse</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="5.73">each phase is pretty much the same and</text>
  <text start="476.1" dur="6.18">right now we&amp;#39;re equal to where we were</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="5.55">back in 2008 and if we look at these the</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="5.669">chart and if we look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="7.049">we can see that we are at the bubble hi</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="6.871">now he says when we look at the charts a</text>
  <text start="491.639" dur="5.491">few things pop out there is a remarkable</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="5.64">time symmetry in each phase of expansion</text>
  <text start="497.13" dur="5.88">and collapse each phase took roughly the</text>
  <text start="500.46" dur="6.15">same period of time to travel from</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="6.42">trough to peak and peak to trough the</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="6.66">index has now exceeded the previous</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="5.97">bubble peak and those who that are</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.35">denying the existence of cycles have</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="5.069">difficulty adequately explaining away</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="5.789">the classic cyclical nature of the 2000</text>
  <text start="520.469" dur="4.801">mm a bubble rise and its collapse and</text>
  <text start="523.409" dur="4.62">when we start to look at this we could</text>
  <text start="525.27" dur="4.8">see that yes we are headed down the same</text>
  <text start="528.029" dur="4.381">exact path now there&amp;#39;s a couple reasons</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="4.5">why the housing bubble has been pushed</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="5.78">up and we mentioned them before because</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="6.33">once again the Fed the central bank is</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="5.98">pumping in a lot of currency free</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="5.309">currency and driving the housing prices</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="3.87">up because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.209" dur="4.111">having hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="548.04" dur="4.08">buy these houses hold on to them</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t put them on the market banks are</text>
  <text start="552.12" dur="3.27">not foreclosing on the houses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.04" dur="3.36">keeping them off the market that drive</text>
  <text start="555.39" dur="4.56">the prices up we also see foreign</text>
  <text start="557.4" dur="5.28">investors well they are coming in with</text>
  <text start="559.95" dur="6.54">cash they&amp;#39;re flooding into North America</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="5.97">and they&amp;#39;re buying real estate but this</text>
  <text start="566.49" dur="4.469">is all coming to an end because we&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="4.47">reported on this before where the</text>
  <text start="570.959" dur="4.801">Chinese investors they&amp;#39;re being stopped</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="4.02">from investing inside of the United</text>
  <text start="575.76" dur="3.6">States a lot of their investment money&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="5.85">going to the belton Road we can see that</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="5.01">the stimulus well that is honking out</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="3.719">right now they&amp;#39;re gonna have to really</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="4.74">increase stimulus to really push this</text>
  <text start="586.709" dur="4.591">further and when we really look at</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="4.53">this we know the everyday American</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re sitting on the sidelines wages</text>

  <text start="603.51" dur="3">continually declining I know that every</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="4.47">time they tell you it goes up but it</text>
  <text start="606.51" dur="6.36">come right back down it&amp;#39;s really gone</text>
  <text start="609.57" dur="5.34">nowhere over a period of time and we</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="4.649">could see at this point that everything</text>

  <text start="617.519" dur="4.56">housing market looks exactly like it was</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="5.76">back in 2008 and this is not a good sign</text>
