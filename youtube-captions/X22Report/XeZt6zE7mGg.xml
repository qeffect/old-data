  <text start="52.79" dur="4.83">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.24" dur="4.95">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.62" dur="6.78">episode 1619 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="61.19" dur="5.67">19th 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.4" dur="5.91">this is how the central banks are</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="5.25">covering up the next collapse let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="4.56">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="4.43">news now as we know the central bankers</text>
  <text start="74.87" dur="3.84">they are very worried about</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="3.34">cryptocurrency even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="78.71" dur="2.07">trying to make it seem like it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="79.88" dur="2.88">that big of a deal</text>
  <text start="80.78" dur="5.16">how cryptocurrency cannot be a</text>
  <text start="82.76" dur="5.58">replacement for their fiat system well</text>
  <text start="85.94" dur="4.86">this is where they&amp;#39;re wrong and we can</text>
  <text start="88.34" dur="3.98">see already from what has been going on</text>
  <text start="90.8" dur="3.75">and what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do is</text>
  <text start="92.32" dur="5.86">that they&amp;#39;re very very nervous about</text>
  <text start="94.55" dur="5.25">this whole entire blockchain system now</text>
  <text start="98.18" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s very interesting the central</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="3.45">bankers continually made the case you</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="2.91">know that criminals use crypto</text>
  <text start="103.25" dur="4.56">currencies terrorists use crypto</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="5.49">currencies and they kept on pushing that</text>
  <text start="107.81" dur="4.02">to demonize crypto currency and they</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="4.59">kept on saying was very volatile because</text>
  <text start="111.83" dur="4.77">not it there&amp;#39;s nothing backing it and</text>
  <text start="114.83" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s moving up and down and of course</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="3.45">this was created to make everyone</text>
  <text start="118.49" dur="3.239">believe that there were problems with</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="4.05">cryptocurrency and they&amp;#39;re saying look</text>
  <text start="121.729" dur="5.041">at the dollar it&amp;#39;s so solid you know the</text>
  <text start="124.1" dur="5.4">dollar is what people should be using</text>
  <text start="126.77" dur="4.86">not crypto currency but of course as we</text>
  <text start="129.5" dur="4.41">know the dollar has lost what 96 97</text>
  <text start="131.63" dur="3.81">percent of its value since the central</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="5.46">bankers put it into place because as we</text>
  <text start="135.44" dur="5.549">know they loan their fiat currency out</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="4.92">to governments with interest attached</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="6.051">when you create cryptocurrency there is</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="5.82">no interest and it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="6.43">compared to centralized so what do they</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="5.24">have to do to get everyone into their</text>
  <text start="153.47" dur="3.66">own cryptocurrency because this is</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="3.639">exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do and</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re gonna make you think that all</text>
  <text start="158.989" dur="4.53">the others are a waste there you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="4.17">use them criminals use them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.519" dur="4.53">volatile and they&amp;#39;re not secure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="3.57">not centralized so they need to create</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="2.521">their own cryptocurrency and we know</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s a couple banks that have been</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="5.639">working on this and we find out that IBM</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="5.19">right now is experimenting with a new</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="3.541">cryptocurrency that is directly tied to</text>
  <text start="178.58" dur="6.39">the u.s. dollar</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="6.01">and of course this is all about keeping</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="3.61">the</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="4.789">cryptocurrency stable and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="4.379">to be using the dollar to do this and</text>
  <text start="190.549" dur="4.241">the tech giant they&amp;#39;re partnering with a</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="4.051">startup called stronghold to launch a</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="5.1">stable coin which will serve as a</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="5.85">tokenized representation of the US</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="5.76">dollar now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="5.28">the central banks get involved in this</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="5.58">and once they develop it they start to</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="4.05">use this to show that look we have a</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="3.089">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="3.629">this is going to be the one and again</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="4.411">their next step would be to have</text>
  <text start="215.819" dur="5.431">government&amp;#39;s say this is the official</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="5.27">cryptocurrency and this is what the</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="6.54">central bankers have been all about</text>
  <text start="224" dur="6.459">controlling the currency creating a</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.319">currency and saying all others are not</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="5.161">worth it you shouldn&amp;#39;t be using them</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="5.331">only use ours so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="4.019">this plays out but once again</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="4.299">cryptocurrency without central bank</text>
  <text start="239.639" dur="3.72">control is fantastic and if you want to</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="3.691">know more about cryptocurrency you know</text>

  <text start="274.47" dur="6.71">site from X 22 report and you can take a</text>
  <text start="276.599" dur="7.261">look at that now we know that the</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="6.04">establishment the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="5.64">do not want anyone leaving their system</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="5.22">we set this over and over and over and</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="5.97">now in the UK we see already the central</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="5.099">bankers they are pushing their narrative</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="4.02">and their narrative always goes</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="4.41">something like this if you try to leave</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="4.53">the central banking establishment they</text>
  <text start="301.949" dur="4.321">tell you that your economy is going to</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="4.889">implode you&amp;#39;ll not be able to survive it</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="3.36">will not work and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="3.901">is happening</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="5.73">the IMF right now is saying a No Deal</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="5.82">brexit scenario would affect the British</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="3.69">economy much more than the EU so the</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="2.849">British</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="5.31">economy will get hurt the EU will not</text>
  <text start="321.479" dur="4.62">and how did they come to find this</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="2.16">information out and how do they know</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="3.03">this</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="4.649">well the IMF did some fresh research and</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="4.651">they figured it all out and they said</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="5.22">yeah if this happens the central bankers</text>
  <text start="333.78" dur="4.379">won&amp;#39;t get hurt it will be the people of</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="3.75">the UK because what will the central</text>
  <text start="338.159" dur="4.171">bankers do they will put a lot of</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="5.221">pressure on the UK if this does happen</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="5.94">and this is the same story that they</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="6.54">always use they always tell you how bad</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s going to be actually if we got rid</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="3.359">of the central banking system we got rid</text>
  <text start="353.49" dur="3.75">of the central bankers creating the</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="3.391">currency and attaching interest to their</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="1.95">currency and letting the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="2.699">borrow it</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="4.229">well our lives would be a lot easier</text>
  <text start="361.349" dur="3.69">because we wouldn&amp;#39;t be enslaved to the</text>
  <text start="363.419" dur="4.62">central bank&amp;#39;s we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="5.611">paying the taxes that were paying to pay</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="5.521">for the interest and everything would be</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="4.889">a lot easier to remember what they do is</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="4.289">not for the benefit of the people what</text>
  <text start="375.539" dur="4.951">they do the central bankers is the</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="5.241">benefit for themselves to make</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="6.6">themselves wealthier to make themselves</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="6.069">have more and the people have less now</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="3.27">what we see happening here in the United</text>
  <text start="389.159" dur="3.75">States not just the United States but</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="4.709">globally we see the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="392.909" dur="3.66">are now pushing their narrative they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="5.07">letting us know that things are starting</text>
  <text start="396.569" dur="5.491">to slow that the trade wars it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="400.139" dur="3.691">to affect the economy globally the</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="3.539">mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="4.199">that the economy is not as strong as</text>
  <text start="405.599" dur="4.021">Trump thinks it is we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="408.029" dur="3.121">heading into a recession remember we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="3.84">been following the economy for a very</text>
  <text start="411.15" dur="4.229">long time we know it&amp;#39;s a gigantic</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="4.56">illusion we know it&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="415.379" dur="4.38">phony and false we know that the numbers</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="4.47">that they&amp;#39;re throwing at us have never</text>
  <text start="419.759" dur="4.59">been real and now the Fed is hiding some</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="6.329">of their data oh it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="424.349" dur="6.66">is the initial jobless claims in last</text>
  <text start="428.819" dur="4.65">week tumbled to around two hundred and</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="5.91">seven thousand now this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="433.469" dur="5.73">level of claims since November 1969 and</text>
  <text start="436.919" dur="5.791">if you look at this and you go back in</text>
  <text start="439.199" dur="9.45">time but into the 70s into the 80s into</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="8.819">the 90s 2001 2008 every time initial</text>
  <text start="448.649" dur="3.871">jobless claims plunged to very very low</text>
  <text start="451.529" dur="4.431">levels we</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="6.6">enter a recession well we&amp;#39;re way below</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="7.389">where we were for each of these</text>
  <text start="459.12" dur="6.539">recessions in the past and every time we</text>
  <text start="463.349" dur="5.19">hit a certain period of time all of a</text>
  <text start="465.659" dur="4.081">sudden we enter a recession now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="2.731">very interesting is they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="5.45">that we&amp;#39;re at what pretty much full</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="7.26">employment whenever we see this normally</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="6.28">wages move up because supply and demand</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="5.069">and we see there are companies that are</text>
  <text start="481.47" dur="4.89">trying to get people in there well guess</text>
  <text start="483.599" dur="5.671">what happens they say listen we&amp;#39;ll pay</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="4.5">you more to come to us what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="4.739">saying is there&amp;#39;s a shortage of workers</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="5.459">and we don&amp;#39;t see this we don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="494.009" dur="4.41">of this which is very odd in itself</text>
  <text start="496.319" dur="5.13">because remember when you&amp;#39;re using fake</text>
  <text start="498.419" dur="5.881">numbers things don&amp;#39;t make sense and this</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="5.701">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing we see Venezuela</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="5.85">right now they will refine their gold in</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="5.55">Turkey to protect their reserves from</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="4.98">the US sanctions and they&amp;#39;re giving it</text>
  <text start="512.7" dur="4.5">to a country that they trust where</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re going to avoid the US sanctions</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="6.75">and again gold is real money gold is</text>
  <text start="522" dur="4.02">your insurance policy and these</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="3.75">countries know this countries around the</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="3.42">world know this the central bank&amp;#39;s know</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="3.57">this and what the central banks do is</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="3.63">they try to convince you otherwise that</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="3.72">no gold is not real money you really</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t need it and this is why here in</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="3.45">the United States people really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="4.62">own that much gold yes they have jewelry</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.889">but they really don&amp;#39;t have their</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="4.56">insurance policy in place where they</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="5.551">have gold where they can protect against</text>
  <text start="546" dur="7.77">a Fiat system completely imploding on</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="8.49">itself now like we said the IMF is out</text>
  <text start="553.77" dur="5.91">there telling us that growth is starting</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="4.14">to slow and now they&amp;#39;re naming certain</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.649">areas they&amp;#39;re saying growth is slowing</text>
  <text start="561.51" dur="6.42">in Japan it&amp;#39;s slowing in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="564.329" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s loading in some Asian economies and</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re giving percentages of how the</text>
  <text start="571.709" dur="3.811">economy is shrinking they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="573.93" dur="4.5">know in the US it&amp;#39;s going to shrink by</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="4.439">eight point eight percent in China and</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="4.32">other emerging economies is going to</text>
  <text start="579.959" dur="5.431">drop point seven percent Japan is point</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="3.339">six percent and they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="3.819">narrative</text>
  <text start="586.089" dur="4.831">right now to let us know that everything</text>
  <text start="589.209" dur="3.451">is starting to fall apart and of course</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="3.419">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="592.66" dur="4.799">this up and they&amp;#39;re going to cover up</text>
  <text start="594.339" dur="5.97">what they&amp;#39;re about to do now we talked</text>
  <text start="597.459" dur="4.5">about how the central bank the Fed has</text>
  <text start="600.309" dur="4.26">been hiding a lot of their data or</text>
  <text start="601.959" dur="6.81">changing their data to fit their</text>
  <text start="604.569" dur="8.221">narrative now when we look at the stock</text>
  <text start="608.769" dur="7.141">market the stock market is not tracking</text>
  <text start="612.79" dur="5.37">the news headlines and from everything</text>
  <text start="615.91" dur="4.589">that we see the stock market doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="620.499" dur="5.041">rumors but real business news that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="4.379">how the stock market is moving right now</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="4.95">and the past month should approve this</text>
  <text start="628.059" dur="4.801">if there were any type of doubt at all</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="4.349">it is hard for investors in some</text>
  <text start="632.86" dur="4.44">analysts to grasp this fact primarily</text>
  <text start="634.839" dur="5.37">because for at least the past few years</text>
  <text start="637.3" dur="5.639">it appeared as those stock markets were</text>
  <text start="640.209" dur="4.29">utterly dictated by headlines out of</text>
  <text start="642.939" dur="4.051">Bloomberg Reuters and other mainstream</text>
  <text start="644.499" dur="5.13">media outlets once investors and</text>
  <text start="646.99" dur="4.289">analysis to this narrative it was</text>
  <text start="649.629" dur="3.841">difficult for them to adapt when the</text>
  <text start="651.279" dur="5.581">dynamic changed they are still living in</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="5.099">the past based on an assumption that was</text>
  <text start="656.86" dur="4.349">never quite correct to begin with in</text>
  <text start="658.569" dur="4.71">reality headlines never actually</text>
  <text start="661.209" dur="4.021">dictated the stock prices it was always</text>
  <text start="663.279" dur="4.62">the Federal Reserve among other central</text>
  <text start="665.23" dur="4.68">bank&amp;#39;s stock market valuations for the</text>
  <text start="667.899" dur="4.88">past several years have tracked almost</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="5.82">perfectly with the Fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="5.5">that is to say every time the Fed</text>
  <text start="675.73" dur="4.229">purchased more assets increased their</text>
  <text start="678.279" dur="5.28">and they increased their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="679.959" dur="5.761">stocks went up now we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="683.559" dur="6.681">unwinding their balance sheet and</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="11.57">they&amp;#39;re raising rates at the same time</text>
  <text start="690.24" dur="9.88">which means yields on bonds are becoming</text>
  <text start="697.29" dur="6.58">competing assets learning investors away</text>
  <text start="700.12" dur="6.839">from stocks once more it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
  <text start="703.87" dur="4.589">note that the Fed is not the only</text>
  <text start="706.959" dur="2.85">central bank that is raising interest</text>
  <text start="708.459" dur="3.48">rates the Bank of Canada the Bank of</text>
  <text start="709.809" dur="5.7">England they are also pushing rates</text>
  <text start="711.939" dur="5.221">higher now we also know that the Fed has</text>
  <text start="715.509" dur="3.481">been the single most important trigger</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="2.52">for the stock markets and we know their</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="2.28">other central</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="4.2">banks that have been buying tech stocks</text>
  <text start="721.27" dur="6.15">and whatnot to push the stock market up</text>
  <text start="723.88" dur="5.25">now if we go back in time to 2012 Jerome</text>
  <text start="727.42" dur="5.55">Powell the current chairman of the Fed</text>
  <text start="729.13" dur="6.72">said the following that essentially</text>
  <text start="732.97" dur="7.65">there will be a stock market crash if</text>
  <text start="735.85" dur="6.299">the Fed raised rates now this is very</text>
  <text start="740.62" dur="4.08">interesting because what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="742.149" dur="5.481">right now is exactly what he predicted</text>
  <text start="744.7" dur="9.18">back in 2012 which he warned about so</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="8.019">back in 2012 Chairman Fed Powell told us</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="4.41">that the stock market would crash if</text>
  <text start="755.649" dur="5.071">interest rates are raised we also know</text>
  <text start="758.29" dur="4.5">that the Fed has been hiding certain</text>
  <text start="760.72" dur="3.929">data like their balance sheet they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="4.38">been changing how the yield curve was</text>
  <text start="764.649" dur="5.69">created and they discontinued other</text>
  <text start="767.17" dur="6.87">types of data now when we look at this</text>
  <text start="770.339" dur="6.19">what are they trying to do here well the</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="5.22">Fed is not attempting to hide the size</text>
  <text start="776.529" dur="5.761">of its asset dumps I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="6.84">trying to hide when they actually do it</text>
  <text start="782.29" dur="5.76">their timing of when they cut because</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="4.29">when you look at the stock market and</text>
  <text start="788.05" dur="6.229">you look at the central bank&amp;#39;s balance</text>
  <text start="790.39" dur="6.9">sheet it went up at the same time and</text>
  <text start="794.279" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re very closely linked</text>
  <text start="797.29" dur="5.51">now when the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="799.5" dur="6.61">decides to cut the balance sheet you</text>
  <text start="802.8" dur="6.1">will see the stock market come down in</text>
  <text start="806.11" dur="4.38">the same exact way now if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="808.9" dur="4.62">when they&amp;#39;re cutting because they got</text>
  <text start="810.49" dur="5.16">rid of that data guess what they can</text>
  <text start="813.52" dur="4.47">hide what they&amp;#39;re doing and no one will</text>
  <text start="815.65" dur="3.33">make the correlation of this is what</text>
  <text start="817.99" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re doing and they&amp;#39;re discontinuing</text>
  <text start="818.98" dur="5.28">that graph so this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="3.69">now with the yield curve they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.26" dur="3.18">attempting to change the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.52" dur="5.15">reported because they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="827.44" dur="5.31">to predict when this recession is coming</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="4.63">because we know in the past has been a</text>
  <text start="832.75" dur="5.579">very accurate indicator of when the</text>
  <text start="835.3" dur="4.71">recession will take place so when we</text>
  <text start="838.329" dur="4.171">look at this we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.01" dur="5.85">changing the yield curve because the Fed</text>
  <text start="842.5" dur="6.72">knows that the economy now is declining</text>
  <text start="845.86" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;re trying to hide a fact that</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="3.42">the economy is declining very rapidly</text>
  <text start="851.32" dur="2.05">right now as they raise their interest</text>
  <text start="852.64" dur="3.34">rates</text>
  <text start="853.37" dur="4.29">as they cut their balance sheet and the</text>
  <text start="855.98" dur="4.83">yield curve is giving us an indicator</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="4.98">that something bad is on the horizon now</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="5.029">of course what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="5.67">using the trade wars as a cover and</text>
  <text start="865.839" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re saying that the trade wars are</text>
  <text start="868.31" dur="5.219">going to be responsible for when this</text>
  <text start="870.589" dur="4.741">whole thing comes down now trade wars</text>
  <text start="873.529" dur="4.381">they have little to do with the behavior</text>
  <text start="875.33" dur="4.62">in equities it is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="877.91" dur="3.6">and to some extent other central banks</text>
  <text start="879.95" dur="3.84">that are controlling the stock market</text>
  <text start="881.51" dur="4.86">prices so when the stock market comes</text>
  <text start="883.79" dur="4.83">down it&amp;#39;s not the trade wars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.37" dur="5.04">actually the interest rates it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="888.62" dur="5.07">actually what the Fed is doing by</text>
  <text start="891.41" dur="4.98">cutting their balance sheet and by</text>
  <text start="893.69" dur="4.38">hiding the yield curve data by not</text>
  <text start="896.39" dur="6.449">really hiding it but by changing it</text>
  <text start="898.07" dur="7.14">people won&amp;#39;t know when this economic</text>
  <text start="902.839" dur="4.171">disaster is going to hit now again the</text>
  <text start="905.21" dur="3.45">Fed has changed other data or got rid of</text>
  <text start="907.01" dur="3.81">other data and what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="908.66" dur="4.679">they&amp;#39;re hiding all of this because they</text>
  <text start="910.82" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know what is really</text>
  <text start="913.339" dur="3.781">going on and they&amp;#39;re setting up their</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="4.83">narrative this is how they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="917.12" dur="4.05">down the entire system now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="3.63">interesting and we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="921.17" dur="3.81">we know that Andrew Jackson is hanging</text>
  <text start="923.18" dur="4.25">on the wall in Trump&amp;#39;s office Andrew</text>
  <text start="924.98" dur="6.72">Jackson got rid of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="927.43" dur="7.39">Trump came out and he blasted the Fed</text>
  <text start="931.7" dur="6.84">and said he is not thrilled about the</text>
  <text start="934.82" dur="5.85">rising rates now he understands what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.54" dur="4.08">going to happen here and again we have</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="5.039">both sides now competing for the</text>
  <text start="942.62" dur="5.76">narrative of this economy and when it</text>
  <text start="945.709" dur="5.491">comes down the winner will control the</text>
  <text start="948.38" dur="5.67">narrative Trump is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="951.2" dur="5.31">the strong dollar is dis aven&amp;#39;t Aegeus</text>
  <text start="954.05" dur="4.979">and we see already the white house came</text>
  <text start="956.51" dur="4.53">out and they tried to cover all this up</text>
  <text start="959.029" dur="3.81">the White House says Trump respects the</text>
  <text start="961.04" dur="3.69">independence of the Fed the White House</text>
  <text start="962.839" dur="4.471">says Trump isn&amp;#39;t interfering with the</text>
  <text start="964.73" dur="6.66">feds decision and what is really</text>
  <text start="967.31" dur="7.38">happening right now is the Patriots</text>
  <text start="971.39" dur="6.78">Trump they know exactly what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="974.69" dur="5.25">doing they know exactly the plan the</text>
  <text start="978.17" dur="4.14">central bankers have to bring down this</text>
  <text start="979.94" dur="4.139">system they know they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="982.31" dur="4.269">down the system and turn around and</text>
  <text start="984.079" dur="5.5">blame it on Trump and the</text>
  <text start="986.579" dur="4.05">Patriot&amp;#39;s and we see right now like we</text>
  <text start="989.579" dur="3.781">said a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="990.629" dur="5.67">Trump was going to come out somehow some</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="4.349">way to point the finger at what the Fed</text>
  <text start="996.299" dur="4.47">is doing and this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="997.709" dur="5.25">stages of this and we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="1000.769" dur="6.03">lot more of this as we move forward</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="6.24">because remember as the Fed begins that</text>
  <text start="1006.799" dur="4.95">take down of the economy they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1009.199" dur="4.44">to do more and more and trumpet the</text>
  <text start="1011.749" dur="4.111">Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to realize is</text>
  <text start="1013.639" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re going to understand what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="5.099">doing here and they&amp;#39;re gonna be calling</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="5.219">the Fed out and sooner or later they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1020.959" dur="4.411">gonna be pointing fingers at the Fed</text>
  <text start="1022.879" dur="4.14">because as the economy starts to break</text>
  <text start="1025.37" dur="3.419">down which we start which we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1027.019" dur="4.89">right now they&amp;#39;re gonna have no choice</text>
  <text start="1028.789" dur="6.27">but to say you know something the Fed is</text>
  <text start="1031.909" dur="4.8">bringing this down the Fed is raising</text>
  <text start="1035.059" dur="3.451">the rates the Fed is doing this and</text>
  <text start="1036.709" dur="3.301">you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of this just</text>
  <text start="1038.51" dur="4.169">like Trump came out in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1040.01" dur="4.289">stages of saying fake news and started</text>
  <text start="1042.679" dur="3.6">to call people out on certain things</text>
  <text start="1044.299" dur="3.691">certain reporters the same thing is</text>
  <text start="1046.279" dur="3.961">going to happen with the central bank</text>
  <text start="1047.99" dur="4.529">now again we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="1050.24" dur="5.76">plays out but as we know we are moving</text>
  <text start="1052.519" dur="6.571">towards a period of time where this</text>
