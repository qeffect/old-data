  <text start="216.66" dur="6.73">besides all that let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="218.95" dur="8.7">economic collapse news now what I find</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="6.12">very interesting is that you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="6.15">said this in my past episodes the United</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="6.54">States has changed the calculations for</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="5.25">unemployment we all know that if they</text>
  <text start="236.05" dur="6.84">changed it for GDP and inflation and now</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="7.14">you&amp;#39;re seeing other countries start to</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="5.849">do this and basically if things don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="5.46">the way the central bank rooms bankers</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="5.671">or the government the way they wanted to</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="5.25">go what they do is they just change</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="5.66">their calculation and I find this</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="6.39">fascinating Japan government to change</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="6.11">inflation calculation ushering an even</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="6.129">more Bank of Japan liquidity</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="4.95">and this goes on to say the change will</text>
  <text start="269.419" dur="4.231">effectively raise the bar for aves</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="4.92">inflation goal as it means that higher</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="6.42">energy prices will be taking out of the</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="7.35">equation so basically everything was not</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="6.569">going as planned so what they did is</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="7.32">they decided let&amp;#39;s take out the higher</text>
  <text start="286.639" dur="7.141">energy prices and we can show you know</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="5.28">we can will change what we&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="293.78" dur="4.41">this way we can print a lot more money</text>
  <text start="296" dur="5.25">the official who was involved in the</text>
  <text start="298.19" dur="4.89">decision to switch the core core said</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="4.199">the change was meant to help ensure that</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="5.369">the world&amp;#39;s number three economy truly</text>
  <text start="305.449" dur="4.321">breaks the grip of deflation so what</text>
  <text start="308.449" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is really not</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="5.459">breaking the grip of deflation so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.349" dur="6.151">just change everything so it does so is</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="6.601">that a real true measurement doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="5.31">make sense to me and it goes on and here</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="3.809">it says the change could result in more</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="4.079">pressure being put on the central bank</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="3.931">to keep flooding the market with yen as</text>
  <text start="327.889" dur="3.661">the inflation target becomes harder to</text>
  <text start="329.57" dur="3.36">achieve it could also complicate the</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="5.76">government&amp;#39;s plan to raise the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="6.63">sales tax and the Bank of Japan is not</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="7.41">going to stop they are going to continue</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="10.43">to print and print and print now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="9.12">heard before that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="7.959">in a bubble and the housing market is</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="6.359">not really recovering and you&amp;#39;ve seen on</text>
  <text start="357.949" dur="6.84">the headlines a lot of the news stations</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="7.56">and a lot of the mainstream media sites</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="4.41">like CNN Fox and all those say that you</text>
  <text start="367.759" dur="3.511">know this is a great time to be a</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="4.56">homeowner it&amp;#39;s a great time to buy</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="8.09">because of the low interest rates but</text>
  <text start="373.759" dur="8.91">what happened was the lender processing</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="5.92">services found that new problem loans</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="5.28">are entering the system at a rate of 0</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="4.319">point seven three percent while that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.949" dur="3.991">an improvement from the darkest days of</text>
  <text start="389.599" dur="4.801">the mortgage crisis it&amp;#39;s still above the</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="5.969">point five five percent rate between two</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="5.07">thousand and two thousand four and what</text>
  <text start="397.909" dur="4.321">they went on to say well</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="5.7">is that the up the LPS found that</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="5.99">existing borrowers are still struggling</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="8.88">and we know the housing crisis cannot be</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="9.94">completely recovering because the Fed is</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="7.71">still purchasing all the toxic real</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="6.5">estate that these banks have at between</text>
  <text start="421.76" dur="5.85">40 and 45 billion dollars a month if</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="6.54">they purchased all the foreclosures and</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="5.97">all these toxic bundles of real estate</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="4.87">they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to do this anymore</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="5.19">but they are still doing it because</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="6.69">these banks still have all of this on</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="6.48">their books and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="6.09">though the number has declined by half</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="6.03">senseless last year more than 7.3</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="4.89">million mortgage holders have loans that</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="5.07">exceed the value of their homes that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="8.31">more than fourteen percent of all</text>
  <text start="456.35" dur="9.06">existing loans okay let&amp;#39;s move on here</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="5.55">and what else it says investors who look</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="4.41">to buy properties and rent out or resell</text>
  <text start="467.6" dur="3.78">them make up about twenty percent of the</text>
  <text start="469.82" dur="4.23">overall market and two-thirds of the</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="7.44">market for distressed properties real</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="8.58">estate agents report that hedge funds</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="6.36">and Wall Street inventors investors have</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="9.27">become very active in California Florida</text>
  <text start="485.18" dur="11.88">Nevada and they are the made investors</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="8.13">that have been buying and then renting</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="5.669">this is their strategy by then rent and</text>
  <text start="500.03" dur="9.449">are competing with first-time homebuyer</text>
  <text start="502.729" dur="9.841">buyers foreclosures there are still a</text>
  <text start="509.479" dur="7.11">hundred and fifty thousand new filings</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="6.87">every month according to realtytrac this</text>
  <text start="516.589" dur="6.361">remains a drag on the US economy now to</text>
  <text start="519.44" dur="5.87">say that housing is completely bouncing</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="6.33">back and everything is going well is</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="7.86">kind of a myth and it&amp;#39;s really hedge</text>
  <text start="529.28" dur="6.14">funds investors buying all these homes</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="5.609">and they&amp;#39;re turning around and renting</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="6.479">it trying to build the bubble up and as</text>
  <text start="538.779" dur="5.401">the prices go up they unload these homes</text>
  <text start="541.899" dur="4.74">at least they&amp;#39;re trying to unload these</text>
  <text start="544.18" dur="4.44">homes and the mainstream media is trying</text>
  <text start="546.639" dur="4.26">to push and the government is trying to</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="5.43">push and the Fed is trying to push</text>
  <text start="550.899" dur="5.581">everyone to think that housing is</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="6.21">recovering and go out and buy a house</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="9.39">now this is also hard to believe when</text>
  <text start="560.26" dur="9.42">half of America is on food stamps just</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="7.29">think about that for a second it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="9.87">even make sense that real estate could</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="10.229">possibly be recovering okay now there</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="7.11">was a report that says the the there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.389" dur="7.531">the lie behind the non-farm payroll</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="6.69">numbers consider in April according to</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="6.63">jolts there were a hundred and eight</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="6.479">thousand job additions but what did the</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.979">government tell us the number was a</text>
  <text start="599.829" dur="6.63">hundred and ninety-five thousand in new</text>
  <text start="602.529" dur="8.101">jobs created in may according to joel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.459" dur="8.761">a hundred and eighteen ja 818 thousand</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="6.69">jobs were added and once again the</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="5.16">government reported there was a hundred</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="7.139">and ninety-five thousand jobs added to</text>
  <text start="620.38" dur="8.1">the market basically in other words the</text>
  <text start="624.459" dur="7.971">headline data is overblown by some forty</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="7.469">percent when looking at the 2013 data</text>
  <text start="632.43" dur="7.899">BLS when manipulating data series across</text>
  <text start="635.949" dur="10.32">dimensions they are manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="640.329" dur="10.141">dimensions of how unemployment and new</text>
  <text start="646.269" dur="6.18">job creation is calculated and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="650.47" dur="4.59">seen this they&amp;#39;ve changed the</text>
  <text start="652.449" dur="5.161">unemployment calculation they remove the</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="6.839">people who are not looking for jobs</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="7.62">who&amp;#39;ve fallen off and just given up they</text>
  <text start="661.899" dur="4.771">change the gauge of the number of people</text>
  <text start="665.23" dur="3.33">they need</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="4.7">to be on track it used to be a hundred</text>
  <text start="668.56" dur="7.17">and fifty thousand and now it is at</text>
  <text start="671.37" dur="7.39">80,000 so it&amp;#39;s a huge manipulation game</text>
  <text start="675.73" dur="6.93">and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing at this</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="6.69">point if you look at Machado stats com</text>
  <text start="682.66" dur="5.55">or even they use six the u6 the</text>
  <text start="685.45" dur="6.57">unemployment rate is around 14.3 percent</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="6.78">if you go back to the calculation before</text>
  <text start="692.02" dur="4.26">they changed it at shadow SATCOM we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="3.78">looking at an unemployment rate of</text>
  <text start="696.28" dur="5.37">around twenty three percent now if we</text>
  <text start="698.77" dur="5.13">take that into account let&amp;#39;s just use</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="7.65">the number fourteen percent fourteen</text>
  <text start="703.9" dur="7.68">percent of Americans are out of work the</text>
  <text start="709.3" dur="5.73">restaurant food stamps they might have</text>
  <text start="711.58" dur="7.74">part-time jobs they might be out of work</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="7.41">but real estate is recovering yeah that</text>
  <text start="719.32" dur="5.31">makes sense now there was an article</text>
  <text start="722.44" dur="6.68">that said consumer credit has second</text>
  <text start="724.63" dur="7.71">highest monthly increase in two years</text>
  <text start="729.12" dur="5.67">may consumer credit higher by nineteen</text>
  <text start="732.34" dur="7.2">point six billion well above</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="8.32">expectations of 12.5 billion this was</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="6.84">the second highest control jump post the</text>
  <text start="743.11" dur="5.43">consumer credit data set revision only</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="6.39">second to the nineteen point nine</text>
  <text start="748.54" dur="7.29">billion from last May so what is the</text>
  <text start="752.77" dur="5.52">reason that these numbers are going up</text>
  <text start="755.83" dur="5.7">well there could be many things one of</text>
  <text start="758.29" dur="5.85">them is a lot of student loans a lot of</text>
  <text start="761.53" dur="5.28">it is a lot of people are buying cars on</text>
  <text start="764.14" dur="7.97">credit a lot of people are using credit</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="9.98">cards to get by every single month so in</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="8.16">that instance people do not have cash</text>
  <text start="776.79" dur="8.53">people are trying to get by on credit</text>
  <text start="780.27" dur="8.02">plus if these people are trying to get</text>
  <text start="785.32" dur="5.37">by just to live to buy food to buy</text>
  <text start="788.29" dur="4.89">clothing to pay their rent and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="790.69" dur="5.34">putting all this on credit that means</text>
  <text start="793.18" dur="5.73">these people are not making the proper</text>
  <text start="796.03" dur="3.85">income to sustain their their current</text>
