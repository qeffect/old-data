  <text start="70.18" dur="5.91">the market is continually moving up and</text>
  <text start="72.729" dur="5.191">once again the market really is not a</text>
  <text start="76.09" dur="3.84">gauge on how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="5.78">remember it is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="79.93" dur="5.969">the central bank controls the market and</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="4.87">we&amp;#39;ve known this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="85.899" dur="4.83">because this is the tool they use to</text>
  <text start="88.57" dur="4.02">convince the people of the United States</text>
  <text start="90.729" dur="4.111">in the world that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.38">well but we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="94.84" dur="2.85">throughout history where the market does</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="2.789">very very well</text>
  <text start="97.69" dur="3.9">and the economy deteriorates in the</text>
  <text start="99.759" dur="4.831">background and eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="101.59" dur="5.27">like in 2008 and 2001 going although</text>
  <text start="104.59" dur="4.86">back to 1929 even further back than that</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="4.86">yes the market hits all-time highs</text>
  <text start="109.45" dur="5.58">people are clapping yelling screaming</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.05">1971 or so it hit a thousand points but</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="3.449">what happens right afterwards is</text>
  <text start="116.77" dur="3.9">everything falls apart and people</text>
  <text start="118.479" dur="5.881">realize wait a minute the market just</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="7.08">fell and the economy is really not doing</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="4.95">as well as they were saying and this is</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="5.099">at the point this is where we are right</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="7.14">now we&amp;#39;re watching this market</text>
  <text start="132.849" dur="5.131">continually move up and as it move up</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="5.19">moves up people are saying that</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="5.46">everything looks good and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="5.19">seeing in the background is everything</text>
  <text start="143.44" dur="6.659">is not doing as well now we can see a</text>
  <text start="146.83" dur="4.98">lot of the numbers are still moving in</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="2.911">certain directions where they were when</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="3.6">Obama was president</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="4.949">because remember Trump really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="3.659">done and yes we have corporations out</text>
  <text start="157.959" dur="3.241">there promising they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="4.741">bringing back manufacturing jobs it</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="5.16">sounds great and at the same time we</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="5.97">have corporations retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="5.43">laying off people so I mean if there is</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="4.679">50,000 people that are just laid off and</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="4.14">we bring back to 75,000 I mean where are</text>
  <text start="174.459" dur="3.991">we going with this I mean think about</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="4.19">the 1.8 million people who&amp;#39;ve lost their</text>
  <text start="178.45" dur="5.03">manufacturing job we need</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="5.88">to bring back 1.8 million and this is</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.71">going to be very tough and we see the</text>
  <text start="186" dur="5.42">initial jobless claims well they have</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="5.129">plunged even further to 44 year lows</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="7.06">something that we haven&amp;#39;t seen since</text>
  <text start="193.319" dur="7.98">1973 but the continuing claims they are</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="6.03">still moving up so right before the</text>
  <text start="201.299" dur="5.28">elections continuing claims they they</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="5.729">completely declined very very quickly</text>
  <text start="206.579" dur="7.231">and after the election they are moving</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="6.09">up right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="5.36">that the American people this is</text>
  <text start="216.329" dur="8.211">according to Bloomberg consumer comfort</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="8.89">this index has never been this high and</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="8.44">the last time it was this high was July</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="8.179">of 2007 and you know what happened one</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="6.929">year later the entire economy fell apart</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="8.741">during this period in 2007 the economy</text>
  <text start="239.909" dur="8.45">was declining people didn&amp;#39;t realize it</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="6.479">yet people didn&amp;#39;t understand it yet</text>
  <text start="248.359" dur="7">people didn&amp;#39;t know why things were</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="5.46">happening why traffic to houses were</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="3.391">drying up and people weren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="256.919" dur="6.511">coming to purchase the house anymore</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="5.97">people didn&amp;#39;t understand why all of it</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="3.959">was happening at the same time because</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="4.169">when they looked at what the government</text>
  <text start="267.389" dur="3.84">was saying when they look when they</text>
  <text start="268.889" dur="3.181">looked at what the Fed was saying they</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="2.341">were saying that everything was</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="3.719">absolutely fine everything was contained</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="3.81">and there were no problems subprime</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="3.75">securities they were rated triple-a so</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.599">made no sense why things were starting</text>
  <text start="279.539" dur="6.63">to rapidly fall apart but the market was</text>
  <text start="283.979" dur="4.351">hitting all-time highs so people felt</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="6.03">really great that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="6.149">and of course as we approach 2008 and we</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="4.801">were into 2008 we know the Fed they</text>
  <text start="294.479" dur="4.56">forecasted no recession and we saw that</text>
  <text start="297" dur="4.19">this was the time during the elections</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="4.531">and the economy started to really</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="4.42">deteriorate very rapidly and then when</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="4.08">we hit October everything completely</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="4.679">fell apart but leading up to that point</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="6.069">in time things were falling apart</text>
  <text start="310.289" dur="5.65">already people were leaving their homes</text>
  <text start="313.719" dur="5.13">because they couldn&amp;#39;t sell it interest</text>
  <text start="315.939" dur="5.671">rate started to creep up people were</text>
  <text start="318.849" dur="7.14">losing jobs but it wasn&amp;#39;t widely</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="7.709">reported sales at companies were</text>
  <text start="325.989" dur="6.121">starting to dip and nobody really</text>
  <text start="329.319" dur="4.71">understood what was going on around this</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="3.329">period of time but we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="334.029" dur="3.06">same exact things and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="335.439" dur="2.671">reporting on this and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="337.089" dur="3.51">that yes</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="4.019">corporations they don&amp;#39;t have the revenue</text>
  <text start="340.599" dur="5.4">to support this market</text>
  <text start="342.129" dur="7.53">I mean coca-cola they had a surprise</text>
  <text start="345.999" dur="4.77">drop in full-year profit and of course</text>
  <text start="349.659" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re saying well this is because of</text>
  <text start="350.769" dur="5.43">refrain uh there uh reef Ranch izing and</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="8.33">in the u.s. they&amp;#39;re bottling operation</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="9.84">and really what&amp;#39;s happening is is that</text>
  <text start="362.219" dur="7.81">there&amp;#39;s falling demand for their product</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="6.09">so they&amp;#39;re trying to cut expenses by</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="5.22">offloading all of this to different</text>
  <text start="372.129" dur="5.49">bottling companies we see Kellogg&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.249" dur="5.79">well it looks like they&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="377.619" dur="6.21">towards major job cuts facility closures</text>
  <text start="381.039" dur="6.81">because their sales forecasts well it</text>
  <text start="383.829" dur="6.17">has been slashed and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="387.849" dur="6.87">might be closing about thirty nine</text>
  <text start="389.999" dur="5.85">distribution centers so when we look at</text>
  <text start="394.719" dur="3.69">the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="5.77">through throughout the United States we</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="6.51">see that their revenues well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="401.619" dur="5.46">where everyone believes they are sales</text>
  <text start="404.919" dur="4.881">are declining they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="407.079" dur="5.221">individuals they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="5.589">manufacturing plants distribution</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="4.909">centers we&amp;#39;re seeing this in retail so</text>
  <text start="415.389" dur="8.42">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a huge</text>
  <text start="417.209" dur="9.51">contraction of the industry and</text>
  <text start="423.809" dur="8.14">everyone&amp;#39;s trying to explain it away</text>
  <text start="426.719" dur="7.62">well we know that the people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.949" dur="5.01">have jobs or if they do have a job</text>
  <text start="434.339" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re making less money even the</text>
  <text start="436.959" dur="5.31">people who had jobs and got another job</text>
  <text start="439.269" dur="4.95">maybe a full-time job the pay isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="442.269" dur="4.29">same people have been writing in saying</text>
  <text start="444.219" dur="3.131">I lost my job but I did find another one</text>
  <text start="446.559" dur="6.991">but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="447.35" dur="9.78">making about $25,000 less or even more</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="5.98">which tells us that wages are declining</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="4.38">and we see this in the tax receipts the</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="5.46">federal tax receipts the state tax</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="6.47">receipts they&amp;#39;re all declining and this</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="6.45">is something that the US economy really</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="7.57">hasn&amp;#39;t seen unless we&amp;#39;re in a new</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="7.59">recession and when we look at the wages</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="6.21">and the hours that employees work we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="6.36">seeing that corporations well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="5.7">starting to cut back on the hours that</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re giving employees and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="5.34">happening right now in fact Graham</text>
  <text start="490.91" dur="4.26">Summers has pointed out we just</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="4.59">witnessed the largest percentage decline</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="6.3">in average weekly hours since the</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="7.41">recession of 2008 so when you put all</text>
  <text start="501.47" dur="5.55">this together declining tax receipts the</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="3.45">revenues that are coming into the</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="4.5">corporation&amp;#39;s the sales</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s all declining retailers well</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re contracting they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="7.59">closing stores UPS guess what their</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="6.96">revenue is declining you put all this</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="6.03">together what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="523.91" dur="5.01">that this economy we&amp;#39;ve been in a</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="3.84">recession because this has been going on</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="5.07">for quite a while this just didn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="5.79">yesterday so we&amp;#39;re already in this</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="5.31">recession Deutsche Bank is out there and</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="4.23">they are saying this is coming from an</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="4.59">analyst inside the Deutsche Bank it is</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="5.4">time to get worried again because if</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="11.94">China was indeed the catalyst for the</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="11.88">global growth in 2016 well in 2017 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.83" dur="3.99">going to have the opposite effect we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="4.26">going to see this whole thing roll over</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="5.46">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="562.58" dur="4.62">and they&amp;#39;re saying well you better start</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="5.16">worrying about what is happening here</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="6.78">marine lepen out in France</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="5.79">well when as de France will be leaving</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="4.43">the eurozone would it mean the end of</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="4.419">the EU single currency and lepen said</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.729">maybe and so what</text>
  <text start="580.649" dur="5.1">euro is in the currency it&amp;#39;s a political</text>
  <text start="583.139" dur="4.32">weapon the euro is a knife which the EU</text>
  <text start="585.749" dur="3.931">put into the backs of the people to</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="5.221">force them to go where they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="589.68" dur="5.269">to go she also said that if the EU</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="4.759">doesn&amp;#39;t transfer power back to Paris</text>
  <text start="594.949" dur="7.151">well it looks like we&amp;#39;re having a fresh</text>
  <text start="597.439" dur="7.75">exit France will be leaving the EU and</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of countries where</text>
  <text start="605.189" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="606.449" dur="5.55">leaving the EU so we&amp;#39;re starting to put</text>
  <text start="609.149" dur="5.94">the picture together here where the EU</text>
  <text start="611.999" dur="4.471">well it looks like their days are</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="2.91">numbered and it looks like a lot of</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="3.539">these countries they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="617.999" dur="4.38">breaking away from that that means the</text>
  <text start="620.009" dur="4.89">central bank of the EU is going to</text>
  <text start="622.379" dur="4.351">wither away the central bank here in the</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="4.68">United States they have major problems</text>
  <text start="626.73" dur="6.209">because we are on the cusp of this</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="4.68">entire system imploding and the central</text>
  <text start="632.939" dur="5.25">bankers they don&amp;#39;t like to lose control</text>
  <text start="634.259" dur="5.341">they like to keep control and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.189" dur="4.171">seeing is that countries they are</text>
  <text start="639.6" dur="5.57">preparing for what is coming which is</text>
  <text start="642.36" dur="5.329">going to be a global economic collapse</text>
  <text start="645.17" dur="6.55">and it&amp;#39;s going to be very very difficult</text>
  <text start="647.689" dur="6.37">we reported a couple reports ago that</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="4.559">bundes Bank was repatriating their gold</text>
  <text start="654.059" dur="4.171">and in January 2016 the blueness Bank</text>
  <text start="656.279" dur="3.66">announced that three years after</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="4.14">commencing the transfer of some of its</text>
  <text start="659.939" dur="6.471">offshore offshore held gold from votes</text>
  <text start="662.37" dur="6.059">located in France in New York they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="666.41" dur="4.839">repatriated about three hundred sixty</text>

  <text start="671.249" dur="3.63">central bank gold reserve held in</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="6.36">Frankfurt to about fourteen hundred tons</text>
  <text start="674.879" dur="7.161">or so and what they started to do was</text>
  <text start="679.35" dur="5.849">they started to speed up the process and</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="5.95">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="685.199" dur="6.901">abundance bank well they have all of</text>
  <text start="687.99" dur="7.92">their gold already the 300 tonnes from</text>
  <text start="692.1" dur="7.429">the New York Fed now why did they speed</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="7.739">this up why did they want all their gold</text>
  <text start="699.529" dur="9.581">under their care because that tells us</text>
  <text start="703.649" dur="6.491">that something is approaching now we</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="7.39">also see</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="7.98">that Russia China and Iran they are well</text>
  <text start="716.5" dur="3.57">russian china they&amp;#39;re no longer purse</text>
  <text start="718.12" dur="5.07">purchasing Treasury bonds they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.07" dur="6.26">dumping Treasury bonds they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="5.46">rid of their dollar reserves and as they</text>
  <text start="726.33" dur="5.04">purchase as they dump their Treasury</text>
  <text start="728.65" dur="6.3">bonds I mean they are purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="731.37" dur="7.35">Iran right now we know that they are</text>
  <text start="734.95" dur="7.02">dumping the dollar in March of this year</text>
  <text start="738.72" dur="6.97">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="741.97" dur="7.23">countries they are leaving and getting</text>
  <text start="745.69" dur="6">rid of anything that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="6.18">United States the dollar the Treasury</text>
  <text start="751.69" dur="5.91">bonds and we see that Germany has</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="5.49">repatriated all their gold they have it</text>
  <text start="757.6" dur="4.32">all and when we start putting the pieces</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="5.25">together we can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="761.92" dur="6.72">here we see that the entire economic</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="4.95">system is falling apart</text>
  <text start="768.64" dur="6.6">the countries in Europe they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="771.07" dur="8.52">be leaving the the EU we already see it</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="6.96">with the UK we see it with Italy we see</text>
  <text start="779.59" dur="6.81">it with France and this is spreading</text>
  <text start="782.2" dur="6.42">which means the EU is doomed we see that</text>
  <text start="786.4" dur="5.93">the other countries they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="788.62" dur="6.78">for what is coming and from many people</text>
  <text start="792.33" dur="5.77">that have been out there talking about</text>
  <text start="795.4" dur="5.1">this economic collapse they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="5.31">talking about how things are going to</text>
  <text start="800.5" dur="7.76">deteriorate very very quickly within</text>
  <text start="803.41" dur="7.41">this year 2017 and some look at cycles</text>
  <text start="808.26" dur="5.23">some look at predictive linguistics like</text>
  <text start="810.82" dur="4.5">cliff high others have been following</text>
  <text start="813.49" dur="4.08">the market saying that this cannot be</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="4.38">sustained but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="5.85">when you look at all of them they all</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="6.66">point to the same point a point in time</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="4.92">which is the latter part of this year</text>
  <text start="826.36" dur="3.72">the third quarter which I find very</text>
  <text start="828.34" dur="4.71">interesting because they&amp;#39;re all using</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="5.37">different methods to understand what is</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="5.88">happening in the market with the economy</text>
  <text start="835.45" dur="6.48">and but all their methods are pointing</text>
  <text start="838.93" dur="4.03">to the same period of time in the same</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="7.09">year</text>
  <text start="842.96" dur="7.53">and just taking that we can see that you</text>
  <text start="849.02" dur="4.92">need to be prepared for what is coming</text>
  <text start="850.49" dur="6.81">because it&amp;#39;s just very strange or very</text>
  <text start="853.94" dur="6.03">big coincidence that all of this is</text>
  <text start="857.3" dur="7.77">pointing towards a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="859.97" dur="6.66">system in this year and just to add to</text>
  <text start="865.07" dur="4.56">that for those people who look at</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="5.91">numbers we know that the central bank</text>
  <text start="869.63" dur="6.42">like the IMF and those elite they like</text>
  <text start="872.54" dur="7.68">to do things with the number-7 and we</text>
  <text start="876.05" dur="5.789">are in the year 2017 and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="880.22" dur="6.059">before I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s true or not</text>
  <text start="881.839" dur="7.231">but it&amp;#39;s a very big coincidence that</text>
  <text start="886.279" dur="7.861">this does happen when the number seven</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="7.079">is involved but no matter what all these</text>
  <text start="894.14" dur="4.73">individuals everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="896.149" dur="6.481">looking at everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="9.46">recording reporting points for the same</text>
  <text start="902.63" dur="9.51">thing that countries are preparing the</text>
  <text start="908.33" dur="5.58">elite are preparing and those</text>
  <text start="912.14" dur="3.54">individuals who are out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="6.42">all pointing to the same period of time</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="6.11">using all different methods and we</text>
  <text start="920.33" dur="5.52">should look at this and say okay</text>
  <text start="921.79" dur="6.73">something is happening here something is</text>
  <text start="925.85" dur="5.79">going to happen something&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="928.52" dur="4.77">wrong the economy we know cannot be</text>
  <text start="931.64" dur="5.37">sustained the way it is we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="933.29" dur="6.6">crashing and we all need to get ready</text>
  <text start="937.01" dur="3.44">and prepared for what is about to happen</text>
