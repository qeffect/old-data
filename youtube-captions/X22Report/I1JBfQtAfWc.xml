  <text start="56.17" dur="5.34">februari 23rd 2017 and the part of the</text>
  <text start="59.17" dur="5.01">episode is a truth bomb just went off</text>
  <text start="61.51" dur="5.85">and it violated the fantasy of a strong</text>

  <text start="67.36" dur="6.06">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="9.331">watching the EU the Fed the central bank</text>
  <text start="73.42" dur="8.36">here and many other countries and what</text>
  <text start="79.06" dur="6.119">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the debt load is</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="5.74">becoming so great and I know we said</text>
  <text start="85.179" dur="3.991">this before you heard it many many other</text>
  <text start="87.52" dur="5.25">places probably not on the corporate</text>
  <text start="89.17" dur="5.97">media that it cannot be sustained and we</text>
  <text start="92.77" dur="5.79">notice as the debt grew interest rates</text>
  <text start="95.14" dur="6.21">went the opposite way to zero then to</text>
  <text start="98.56" dur="7.53">negative and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="101.35" dur="8.449">is that America has a debt problem the</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="7.59">Chinese have a debt problem and the EU</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="7.78">they also have a debt problem and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.68" dur="7.53">not just in Greece as per the Maastricht</text>
  <text start="117.579" dur="6.21">Treaty the country&amp;#39;s the EU states</text>
  <text start="121.21" dur="6.449">cannot have debt more than sixty percent</text>
  <text start="123.789" dur="6.061">of their gdp currently the situation is</text>
  <text start="127.659" dur="5.58">nowhere close to this ideal as 21</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="7.44">countries well live past this limit and</text>
  <text start="133.239" dur="6.661">five have more debt than their GDP the</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="4.14">situation is serious with Greece where</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="5.459">their debt is one hundred and</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="6.089">seventy-seven percent of the gdp while</text>
  <text start="145.359" dur="6.111">the world is focusing on Greece&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.519" dur="6.271">extreme debt crisis Italy Portugal</text>
  <text start="151.47" dur="5.29">easily miss the spotlight despite having</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="4.74">high public debts Italy&amp;#39;s dead is a</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="5.64">hundred and thirty two percent of its</text>
  <text start="158.53" dur="6.9">gdp while Portugal&amp;#39;s that is 129 percent</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="6.45">of its gdp Cyprus Spain Belgium France</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="7.26">Ireland Austria are also higher than the</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="6.63">euro average so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="6.06">here is that they&amp;#39;re not following along</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="4.89">with their own treaty United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="3.03">also falls into this category with a</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="4.949">debt standing at 89 point</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="7.65">one percent of their gdp and if we go</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="6.301">back to this maastricht treaty well the</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="6.57">EU states going to have debt more than</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="7.19">sixty percent of their gdp and all of</text>
  <text start="196" dur="8.55">these countries they&amp;#39;re not even close</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="9.7">they have a debt problem because this</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="6.21">system is based on debt yes it sounds</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="4.65">great when you&amp;#39;re creating the paperwork</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="5.28">and you&amp;#39;re going through the process but</text>
  <text start="213.16" dur="5.04">in reality if you have a central bank</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="7.61">that loans you money with interest</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="9.36">attached it&amp;#39;s impossible to get anywhere</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="5.47">you&amp;#39;ll just pile on debt and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="4.259">this here in the United States and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="5.88">seen throughout Europe and it is getting</text>
  <text start="231.819" dur="5.581">worse this is why they brought the</text>
  <text start="235" dur="4.95">interest rates down to the negative</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="5.94">range in Europe because it would be a</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="7.23">complete disaster if interest rates</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="6.899">started to rise here in the United</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.61">States we see we have problems with</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="5.911">pensions I mean the Dallas police</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="5.999">pension board well they&amp;#39;re in trouble I</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="4.38">mean for the past several months we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="258.789" dur="5.221">been warning that taxpayers of the city</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="8.49">of Dallas well they might have to pay</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="6.81">and guess what the board voted 920 to</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="5.04">approve a plan that would just would do</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="7.74">just that the taxpayers are going to</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="7.59">bail out the pension so the failing</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="5.729">pension system the taxpayers are going</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="8.31">to cough up an extra twenty two million</text>
  <text start="284.289" dur="8.821">per year and this is one indicator of</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="6.99">what is coming you think Dallas is the</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="5.94">only city that has a problem no there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="6.15">countless other cities that have the</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="6.96">same exact problem and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="6.24">here is that this system that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="6.719">on all different levels in all different</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="5.819">areas is falling apart now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="312.729" dur="2.861">talking about the housing market quite a</text>
  <text start="315.159" dur="2.951">bit</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="5.85">and it was a joint white paper by Adam</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="6.78">and clear capital titled landlord land</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="6.27">that analyzes who&amp;#39;s behind the house</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="5.97">housing boom that drove home prices to</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.33">all-time highs and in many markets far</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="7.89">beyond the prior crazy bubble highs even</text>
  <text start="334.04" dur="7.38">as homeownership well plunged to 50 year</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="4.68">lows which is the first indicator that</text>
  <text start="341.42" dur="6">tells us something else is going on here</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="6.83">now first time buyers are the crux to a</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="7.31">healthy housing market but guess what</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="7.66">they aren&amp;#39;t buying pretty much at all in</text>
  <text start="354.73" dur="6.1">2012 buyers with FHA insured mortgages</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="5.49">who are typically first-time homebuyers</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.04">with low down payment well according to</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="7.11">this report accounted for twenty-five</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="10.02">percent in 2012 and this was of all home</text>
  <text start="370.52" dur="9.24">purchases in 2013 their share dropped to</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="8.76">twenty percent in 2014 it dropped to</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="7.83">eighteen percent so the question is who</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="6.36">then is buying who is driving this</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="6.39">housing market is it institutional</text>
  <text start="391.01" dur="5.67">investors well they include the largest</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="7.86">by to rent wall street landlords some</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="9.53">with over 40,000 single-family homes now</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="7.11">they did this between 2009 and 2013 and</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="5.32">what happened was the housing prices</text>
  <text start="408.95" dur="5.19">continually moved up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="6.72">up and of course case-shiller looks at</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="5.97">22 cities and then that&amp;#39;s it we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="6.71">noticing that prices are starting to</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="7.35">come down even in some of the 22 cities</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="5.08">institutional investors they started to</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="6.36">step back this is how a bubble is</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="5.73">created because institutional investors</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="4.62">they go out and they purchase these</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="5.46">things very very cheaply they hold on to</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="5.85">them rent them if you can banks are</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="5.25">instructed to keep houses off the market</text>
  <text start="444.29" dur="4.89">so if someone for closes don&amp;#39;t put it on</text>
  <text start="446.48" dur="4.909">the market it drives the prices up</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="5.609">and when they get them up high enough</text>
  <text start="451.389" dur="6.881">they step back and when they step back</text>
  <text start="454.789" dur="6.271">what happens they bring in the small</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="4.29">investor and that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="4.139">right now this is what this report is</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="5.609">saying the small investor has jumped</text>
  <text start="465.199" dur="4.861">into the housing market where they have</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="6.06">flippers and they&amp;#39;re trying to rent and</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="9.02">all these things so what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="7.801">doing right now is in 2015 and 2016</text>
  <text start="479.08" dur="6.339">investors have pulled back small</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.859">investors you know the mom and pop you</text>
  <text start="485.419" dur="3.331">know everyday person is as I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="486.889" dur="5.28">purchase a house rent it out or maybe</text>
  <text start="488.75" dur="6.03">two houses rent it out because prices</text>
  <text start="492.169" dur="5.161">keep going up well they&amp;#39;re getting up in</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="3.96">in at the point where it&amp;#39;s at its height</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="4.679">and it&amp;#39;s starting to come down they just</text>
  <text start="498.74" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t realize it yet so what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="502.009" dur="5.551">right now is these small investors are</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="4.38">buying up the houses and the housing</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="6.109">market starting to fall apart actually</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="6.51">we saw this back in 2008 prior to this</text>
  <text start="513.669" dur="4.781">small investors were coming in people</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="4.529">owned three four five different homes</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="3.719">that were renting them out because I</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="4.801">said whoa look at the prices are going</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="6.241">up incredibly high and what happened</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.97">things rapidly fell apart now the feds</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="4.679">national activity index and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="4.62">looking at this for quite a while well</text>
  <text start="533.089" dur="5.911">it dropped in January missing</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="5.88">expectations as 49 of the 85</text>
  <text start="539" dur="4.89">subcomponents deteriorated now the</text>
  <text start="541.94" dur="4.95">Chicago Fed national index which was</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="6.75">about 85 economic indicators was minus</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="5.43">point 05 in January versus point 18 in</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="5.55">December now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="552.32" dur="8.6">about this is that every time this index</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="8.97">goes below zero we&amp;#39;re in a recession and</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="9.88">things rapidly deteriorate we saw this</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="9.69">back in two thousand eight prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="8.76">we hit a negative point three and as we</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="6.989">went into 2009-2010 it dropped like a</text>
  <text start="579.56" dur="3.579">rock we saw this in the year 2000 go</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="3.761">into 2001</text>
  <text start="583.139" dur="4.8">and we saw this going all the way back</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="5.13">in time and it&amp;#39;s a good indicator to</text>
  <text start="587.939" dur="7.37">tell us where we are right now so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="10.889">in the negative range we have been since</text>
  <text start="595.309" dur="10.63">2015 this illusion is about to fall</text>
  <text start="601.619" dur="7.2">apart now Bundesbank as we know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="605.939" dur="5.82">wanted all their goal back well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.819" dur="7.74">preparing for record losses once the ECP</text>
  <text start="611.759" dur="6.36">starts hiking rates and they reported</text>
  <text start="616.559" dur="5.28">the smallest profit in more than a</text>
  <text start="618.119" dur="6.56">decade in 2016 and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="621.839" dur="8.03">that they&amp;#39;re very worried because if</text>
  <text start="624.679" dur="8.53">mario draghi stops doing what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="629.869" dur="8.71">rates start to increase their getting</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="8.67">prepared for something catastrophic now</text>

  <text start="641.879" dur="5.101">credit market well it just turned</text>
  <text start="644.73" dur="4.349">negative and we had many different</text>

  <text start="649.079" dur="4.74">credit market is going to freeze up and</text>
  <text start="651.629" dur="6.87">what&amp;#39;s very interesting right now is</text>
