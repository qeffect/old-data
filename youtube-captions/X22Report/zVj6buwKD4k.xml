  <text start="67.96" dur="5.49">bankruptcy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.32" dur="6.24">collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="73.45" dur="7.02">understand that the UK had a brexit vote</text>
  <text start="77.56" dur="7.23">and the people wanted to basically</text>
  <text start="80.47" dur="6.27">detach themselves from the EU and the</text>
  <text start="84.79" dur="4.469">central bankers well they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="86.74" dur="5.1">this to happen and they&amp;#39;ve been fighting</text>
  <text start="89.259" dur="4.591">as hard as they possibly can the elite</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="5.76">the central bank&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="6.42">to happen and it looks like the UK prime</text>
  <text start="97.6" dur="4.44">minister Theresa May might have won a</text>
  <text start="100.27" dur="3.09">watered down vote that leaves her</text>
  <text start="102.04" dur="3.42">cabinet in control the brexit</text>
  <text start="103.36" dur="5.34">negotiations for now but in order to</text>
  <text start="105.46" dur="6.03">avert mutiny she had to accept a</text>
  <text start="108.7" dur="7.08">considerable concession now the UK</text>
  <text start="111.49" dur="8.25">government wins by 324 vs. 298 in the</text>
  <text start="115.78" dur="8.82">key brexit amendment now government will</text>
  <text start="119.74" dur="7.29">use 5a and 5b but not 5c of the Greve</text>
  <text start="124.6" dur="5.15">amendment as basis for a discussion on</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="5.039">meaningful vote the Greve amendment is a</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="4.66">slightly watered down version of the</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="4.261">original meaningful vote amendment the</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="4.44">House of Commons will be able to direct</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="5.1">brexit negotiations if there&amp;#39;s no deal</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="5.219">by the end of November and lor mayor</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="5.01">lawmakers will have a veto on how it</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="4.981">goes from there the government has made</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="6.3">big concessions towards the Tory rebels</text>
  <text start="149.05" dur="6.33">lobbying for a softer brexit this puts a</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="6.15">huge amount of pressure on Mays cabinet</text>
  <text start="155.38" dur="6.21">to sort itself out and conclude a deal</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="7.11">with the October you summit now looking</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="6.81">like a Big Crunch date brexit returns to</text>
  <text start="166" dur="5.19">Parliament it is likely to adopt a</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="5.73">softer approach and again the central</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="4.86">bankers the elite they&amp;#39;re pushing back</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="4.11">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen and</text>
  <text start="176.05" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop it at every turn</text>
  <text start="178.24" dur="4.889">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this whole</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="5.579">thing plays out and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="183.129" dur="4.151">has been a difficult road and the people</text>
  <text start="186.159" dur="3.55">still</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="4.35">want the brexit we know that the elite</text>
  <text start="189.709" dur="3.811">the central bankers they told us how</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="3.48">this was going to fail they told us how</text>
  <text start="193.52" dur="3.93">the economy was going to implode they</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="3.959">told us so many different things if this</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="3.84">went through and it didn&amp;#39;t go through</text>
  <text start="199.069" dur="5.071">and we saw nothing of what they said and</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="4.59">now they&amp;#39;re saying well if the brexit</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="3.24">actually happens we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="3.48">shortages we&amp;#39;re gonna see this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="4.26">gonna see that again this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="4.56">do with the brexit this has to do with</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="4.349">the economy imploding and eventually</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="4.01">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the economy</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="4.201">will implode and if this goes through</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="4.18">guess what other countries are gonna</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="3.66">look at this and say we don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="3.599">part of this either actually Italy is</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="3.96">looking at this right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.709" dur="3.931">already taken the approach that maybe we</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="4.38">should be separate and apart from the EU</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="4.65">so it&amp;#39;s already starting to spread and</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re gonna see other countries step up</text>
  <text start="234.29" dur="3.87">and say the same exact thing here in the</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="4.44">United States we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="5.07">inflation consumer prices are surging</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="4.47">and let me just say this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="4.8">seeing inflation basically the central</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="5.73">banks the Fed have been pushing</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="6.36">inflation out into housing into the</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="5.909">student loan market into other countries</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="6.089">into health insurance health coverage</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="8.581">into many other things the stock market</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="8.881">so we don&amp;#39;t see it on a everyday usage</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="6.15">of food supplies and things that we need</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="6.24">every day but we do see it we see we do</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="6">see prices increasing on many of these</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="5.52">things and for the 32nd consecutive</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="8.43">month the Consensus Estimate on the</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="9">street was 0.2 percent increase month on</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="6">month and expectations were met pushing</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.37">the headline CPI to 2.8 percent</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="6.87">year-on-year the highest since December</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="6.9">of 2011 the core CPI also rose to 2.1</text>
  <text start="299.39" dur="5.79">percent this is the highest into 2017 of</text>
  <text start="302.39" dur="4.62">January the indexes for new vehicles</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.01">education and communication tobacco</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="5.55">increased in May the index for all items</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="4.289">less food and energy rose by 2.2 percent</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.05">over the last 12 months after increasing</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="5.341">2.1 percent in the 12 months ending</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="3.87">March and April we also see the medical</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="4.74">care in</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="7.59">Dex rose by 2.4% shelter index rose by</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="6.9">3.5% over the last 12 months real wage</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="6.03">growth is slumping so as real wage</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="5.54">growth is slumping we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="5.67">inflation in all these different areas</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.03">so this tells us it&amp;#39;s going to be get</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s going to become more and more</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="4.65">difficult as we move forward and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="4.89">gonna see a lot more inflation because</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="3.9">everything&amp;#39;s starting to break down I</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="3.33">mean and we&amp;#39;re seeing it across the</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="4.11">board here we&amp;#39;re seeing it in every</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="6.12">economic sector we see it in the</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="6.12">automobile sector now auto lenders there</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="5.04">are they are becoming very very nervous</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="5.04">because they went to those people who</text>
  <text start="362.57" dur="4.47">had good credit those people have subpar</text>
  <text start="364.85" dur="4.77">credit those people have subprime credit</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="5.25">and they&amp;#39;re running out of people to</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="5.67">lend money to and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="372.29" dur="5.94">right now is they&amp;#39;re taking anyone and</text>
  <text start="375.29" dur="5.19">to get anyone in there extending the</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="3.45">loan terms they&amp;#39;re reducing their</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="4.8">standards they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="6.12">possibly can to push sales because right</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="6.17">now the automobile industry is hurting</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="5.91">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="391.45" dur="3.7">delinquencies they are rising because</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="2.85">what are they doing they&amp;#39;re giving loans</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="3.99">to those people who really can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="4.35">it who can&amp;#39;t make payments and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.14" dur="3.54">trying to bring these people in any way</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="3.99">they possibly can but eventually what</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="4.95">happens is they are delinquent on the</text>
  <text start="404.9" dur="5.37">loans and many times they default now in</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="6.45">the first quarter the average loan term</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="5.94">for a new car exceeded 69 months the</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="4.34">second consecutive quarter it had ever</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="5.67">been above that level according to</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="5.92">Experian also in the first quarter new</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="6.14">car loans originated with repayment</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="6.06">periods of between 73 and 84 months</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="5.77">represented more than a third of total</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="8.46">new car loans up from 7% of loans in</text>
  <text start="433.79" dur="6.66">late 2009 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever they can</text>
  <text start="440.45" dur="6.93">to lend money because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="4.2">business they&amp;#39;re in and they need car</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="4.16">sales and they can see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="4.49">becoming more and more difficult</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="3.45">and basically eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="2.7">happen you&amp;#39;re just gonna run out of</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="3">people because what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="3.39">with all these people taking these loans</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re gonna see delinquencies rise we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="4.56">gonna see default rise and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="5.01">be heading into a major major problem</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="4.2">and what is that major problem well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="3.75">going to be a bankrupt country</text>
  <text start="468.67" dur="5.82">I mean we&amp;#39;re heading in that direction</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="8.22">we&amp;#39;re one step closer I mean listen to</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="7.05">what has come out from the Treasury now</text>

  <text start="536.41" dur="7.8">hundred and forty-one billion the surge</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="7.11">in spending led to a may budget deficit</text>

  <text start="577.57" dur="6.28">well the u.s. is continually spending</text>
  <text start="580.6" dur="6.969">tax receipts are dropping and</text>
  <text start="583.85" dur="6.419">this is a recipe for disaster we are one</text>
  <text start="587.569" dur="4.5">step closer to bankruptcy this is the</text>
  <text start="590.269" dur="4.861">whole point of this they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="592.069" dur="6.301">continue this why because they need to</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="6.389">crash the current system who are they</text>
