  <text start="56.86" dur="5.16">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.33" dur="6.75">episode 1514 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="62.02" dur="5.1">6th 2018 and the tot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.08" dur="3.84">we are approaching the point where the</text>
  <text start="67.12" dur="4.77">economic illusion is going to be</text>
  <text start="68.92" dur="5.28">shattered let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.89" dur="4.8">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="74.2" dur="4.02">watching a complete breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="76.69" dur="4.08">economy not interest here in the United</text>
  <text start="78.22" dur="6.54">States but in different countries now</text>
  <text start="80.77" dur="7.2">Australia their retailers are continuing</text>
  <text start="84.76" dur="6.66">to struggle and they really thought that</text>
  <text start="87.97" dur="7.71">come January retail was going to spike</text>
  <text start="91.42" dur="6.87">and rebound but the rebound failed and</text>
  <text start="95.68" dur="5.79">it looks like during Christmas Christmas</text>
  <text start="98.29" dur="4.92">sales were very very weak January retail</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="4.95">sales figures disappoint with weak</text>
  <text start="103.21" dur="5.82">growth across most sectors the current</text>
  <text start="106.42" dur="6.71">account deficit blows out by billions to</text>
  <text start="109.03" dur="7.89">14 billion and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.61">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is the economies</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="6.9">around the world of developed nations</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="7.96">they are quickly falling apart now we</text>
  <text start="123.82" dur="5.79">were meant to believe that the economies</text>
  <text start="126.7" dur="4.68">around the world after 2008 everything</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="3.47">was improving it was getting better</text>
  <text start="131.38" dur="4.889">don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="5.8">what really happened was was the central</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="4.801">banks they stepped in and they pumped</text>
  <text start="138.88" dur="4.68">everything up just like a drug addict</text>
  <text start="141.07" dur="4.889">where they pumped the druggie full of</text>
  <text start="143.56" dur="3.209">drugs they feel great everything is</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="4.321">fantastic</text>
  <text start="146.769" dur="6.051">until it all wears off and as it wears</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="4.95">off you start going through withdrawal</text>
  <text start="152.82" dur="4.78">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;ve done as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="6.3">can and right now even if they add more</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="5.759">stimulus and they create more currency</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="4.649">it&amp;#39;s not going to help the situation the</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="3.481">reason why it&amp;#39;s not going to help is</text>
  <text start="168.549" dur="4.141">because they can control the creation of</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="4.019">currency they can control the derivative</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="4.23">market they can control the stock market</text>
  <text start="174.459" dur="4.441">they can make deals with different</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="3.84">countries where the people of the</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="5.25">countries take out loans to purchase</text>
  <text start="180.76" dur="5.87">cars go to school and they can inflate</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="6.11">bubbles so people purchase homes</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="9.13">the one thing they can&amp;#39;t really do is</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="9.13">have people go out get a nice paying job</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="6.6">and go spend that money that is their</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="7.47">main problem and this is this has been</text>
  <text start="202.36" dur="7.35">their problem since 2008 the job market</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="6.51">has been declining wages have been</text>
  <text start="209.71" dur="7.77">declining and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="213.37" dur="7.11">if you don&amp;#39;t have that the spending in</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="6.27">retail is not going to happen the</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="6.59">purchases of homes cars student loans is</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="7.29">going to slow remember in the beginning</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="6.22">it&amp;#39;s fantastic you&amp;#39;re using someone</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="4.71">else&amp;#39;s money you&amp;#39;re borrowing that money</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="4.65">to purchase that house you&amp;#39;re borrowing</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="5.58">money to purchase that car you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="7.26">borrowing money to go to school but the</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="10.23">thing that happens 6-7 years later is</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="8.46">that this money comes do or you need to</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="4.08">make payments throughout this time and</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="4.639">if more and more individuals are losing</text>
  <text start="255.64" dur="5.52">jobs and more and more people are</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="5.141">getting part-time jobs because they lost</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="5.82">a job and they&amp;#39;re not getting the cost</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="5.55">of living raises well all these loans it</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="4.17">starts to fall apart yes they can resort</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="4.65">to credit cards which we&amp;#39;ve seen they</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="5.19">can access their savings and as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="4.23">seen as we went throughout the recovery</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="4.07">period that they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="6.89">about savings has declined rapidly</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="7.57">credit cards have increased rapidly and</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="7.06">we&amp;#39;re coming to a point where the people</text>
  <text start="287.98" dur="6.63">just don&amp;#39;t have work there&amp;#39;s a hundred</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="5.46">plus million people that are completely</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="4.23">out of the work force they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="4.08">for a job they would like to have a high</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="7.47">paying job and salaries have declined</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="7.559">since 2008 the high paying jobs have</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="5.13">been shipped out of this country this is</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="6.571">what we are saying now we&amp;#39;ve been kept</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="7.89">in this drugged up illusionary economy</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="5.08">and right now what is happening is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="4.72">going to be shattered</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="6.15">and we&amp;#39;re at that point where this is</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="4.38">being pushed right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="4.68">many different indicators that are</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="5.31">showing us signs that we are headed in</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="4.53">that direction one area we need to look</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.77">at is gold once they lose the</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="4.17">manipulation control of the gold market</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="3.6">the precious metals market you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="3.99">see gold move up we seem go move up</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="3.6">quite a bit doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re not gonna try to</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="4.56">smash it down I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="3.99">a day or two all of a sudden we see</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="5.4">thousands of paper contracts come in and</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="4.47">smash it down and if they don&amp;#39;t come in</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="4.59">and smash it down and it continually</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="6.38">moves up $20 $30 $40</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="6.12">you know they lost control which means</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="4.75">everything is in motion which means most</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="3.72">likely the market is going to come down</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="3.86">the dollar is going to decline even</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="3.78">further we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="371.92" dur="3.94">we&amp;#39;re gonna see all of it</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="7.44">but we are seeing many different</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="7.11">indicators if you look at Manhattan we</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="3.36">see the apartment sales of Manhattan</text>
  <text start="382.97" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve been declining they fell in</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="5.46">January to the lowest monthly rate since</text>
  <text start="386.48" dur="6.54">February of 2012 this is a six year low</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="5">and it&amp;#39;s trending downwards that</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="4.98">everything is declining right now and</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="7.3">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that prices are</text>
  <text start="398" dur="8.16">coming down sales are coming down coops</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="7.23">condos they have dropped by 20% in</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="7.35">Manhattan it&amp;#39;s all falling apart leases</text>
  <text start="409.67" dur="7.35">are dropping right now we saw this these</text>
  <text start="413.51" dur="5.54">type of signs back in 2008 in California</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="5.49">and then it came over to the East Coast</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="5.92">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in the big</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="5.07">cities where they pumped up the bubbles</text>
  <text start="424.97" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart we see</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="4.2">right now US factory orders they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="4.44">tumbled durable good plunged in January</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="4.98">and we see that US factory orders</text>
  <text start="434" dur="5.58">tumbled by 1.4 percent this is the first</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="4.68">drop in six months and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="4.14">transportation equipment is down by 10</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="4.98">percent non-defense aircraft is down by</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="5.76">negative 28 percent defense aircraft</text>
  <text start="446.42" dur="5.31">down by negative 45 percent and it goes</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="4.8">on and on and on and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="451.73" dur="5.28">is a complete breakdown of this</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="3.96">system now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="457.01" dur="3.83">there making a really big deal about</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="5.76">tariffs we talked about tariffs we</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="5.32">discussed what Bush tried to do back</text>
  <text start="464" dur="5.28">many years ago when he was trying to</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="5.52">push tariffs on steel and everything</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="3.9">like that and the market well that would</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="5.55">have corrected it would have brought the</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="7.65">economy down Trump is putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="477.23" dur="6.09">pressure on getting rid of what the</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="4.589">central bankers have done for years</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="4.17">where the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="485.419" dur="4.861">which are intertwined they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="4.41">these deals that were not a benefit to</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="4.41">the people they were a benefit to</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="6.23">themselves NAFTA and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="5.91">trade deals they all have to go and</text>
  <text start="498.13" dur="3.88">everything has to be wiped clean now</text>
  <text start="500.6" dur="4.71">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about these</text>
  <text start="502.01" dur="6.27">tariffs is Europe is renewing their</text>
  <text start="505.31" dur="7.08">tariffs on Chinese steel pipes as high</text>
  <text start="508.28" dur="8.34">as seventy two percent and do you hear</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="6.06">anyone saying a word about this and the</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="3.57">European Commission came out and they</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="4.05">explained it had set final duties up</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="4.83">between eighteen and thirty five percent</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="5.49">for five years for producers including</text>
  <text start="525.02" dur="6.81">bang gang steel plates hand in iron and</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="7.44">steel and has steel so we can see right</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="5.7">now that they already have tariffs now</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="4.44">the reason why the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="4.08">deep state the reason why they didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="4.38">any of this here in this country where</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="4.38">they made it very lopsided is because</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="5.13">they were pushing their system out of</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="4.95">the country to someplace else and they</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="4.02">were doing this on purpose because they</text>
  <text start="550.94" dur="5.13">knew eventually what they wanted to do</text>
  <text start="553.4" dur="5.76">and remember their plan was to implement</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="4.38">TPP bring down the United States to the</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="4.26">rest of the world the level of the</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="4.56">United the rest of the world and have</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="3.69">the United States as a third world</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="5.46">country the system then would be moved</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="6.03">to another country and they would accept</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="5.13">workers from all over the world and they</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="4.29">would not get paid us salaries they get</text>
  <text start="575.6" dur="3.66">paid from whatever salary they were</text>
  <text start="577.43" dur="3.99">getting from their country which means</text>
  <text start="579.26" dur="6.06">the u.s. worker would have to lower</text>
  <text start="581.42" dur="6.24">their requirements and the entire</text>
  <text start="585.32" dur="4.2">country would completely change</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="5.67">this was their plan this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="589.52" dur="6.93">been pushing their agenda all this time</text>
  <text start="593.33" dur="4.62">because they knew what they needed to do</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="4.32">they needed to reach that goal of</text>
  <text start="597.95" dur="6.51">bringing the United States down to the</text>
  <text start="600.77" dur="6.45">rest of the world and again this is</text>
  <text start="604.46" dur="4.29">being shattered right now we see light</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="3.78">Hauser right now is saying listen than</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="5.25">half the talks they&amp;#39;re not going well at</text>
  <text start="611" dur="5.4">all NAFTA 2.0 it&amp;#39;s not going well they</text>
  <text start="614" dur="6">need to agree on roughly 30 chapters</text>
  <text start="616.4" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve only agreed on six now of course</text>
  <text start="620" dur="5.7">all the other countries like Canada</text>
  <text start="621.77" dur="7.17">Mexico and the rest they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="625.7" dur="7.23">about making a deal they already have a</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="7.2">good deal the u.s. does not have a good</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="6.63">deal so in the beginning Trump didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.14" dur="5.49">want NAFTA still doesn&amp;#39;t and what is</text>
  <text start="639.56" dur="6.27">what the approach he&amp;#39;s taking right now</text>
  <text start="641.63" dur="6.57">is to completely shatter the economic</text>
  <text start="645.83" dur="6.33">system that was created by the central</text>
  <text start="648.2" dur="4.83">bank by the deep state and he needs to</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="4.89">get rid of it</text>
  <text start="653.03" dur="7.92">this is exactly what he is pushing for</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="6.42">and you can see by the way the corporate</text>
  <text start="660.95" dur="3.93">media and everyone is reacting they</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t want this to end remember they</text>
  <text start="664.88" dur="5.31">love their system everything subsidized</text>
  <text start="668.39" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re getting free money from the</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="6.21">central bank people become very very</text>
  <text start="673.31" dur="4.2">wealthy in government they leave they</text>
  <text start="676.4" dur="3.21">come in like you know they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="4.05">$100,000 all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re worth</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="3.84">millions upon millions upon millions of</text>
  <text start="681.56" dur="4.89">dollars as they leaves govern as they</text>
  <text start="683.45" dur="5.79">leave government so right now the system</text>
  <text start="686.45" dur="6.42">that we&amp;#39;re in is being ripped apart and</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s going to be reset now how long is</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="4.98">this reset going to last well if the</text>
  <text start="695.78" dur="5.52">Trump administration and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="5.22">behind him have their way they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="4.86">try to make it as easy as possible if</text>
  <text start="703.07" dur="5.73">the central bankers went out it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="4.56">to be rough very difficult and the</text>
  <text start="708.8" dur="4.92">system is gonna come down very very hard</text>
