  <text start="265.99" dur="3.48">had a lower the scores you know to</text>
  <text start="267.699" dur="3.9">purchase an automobile they had a load</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="3.36">of the scores to purchase a house so</text>
  <text start="271.599" dur="3.961">they can get more and more people in</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="4.769">well they took that to the edge here and</text>

  <text start="277.599" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is the next</text>
  <text start="279.909" dur="4.98">phase they need to bring in more and</text>

  <text start="284.889" dur="5.581">are they going to do well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="7.41">to change the FICO scores they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="6.9">to remove certain requirements within</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="5.67">the FICO score to allow people to get</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="5.34">credit now the changes are expected to</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="4.83">boost consumer lending especially among</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="4.47">those who are completely shut out of the</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="3.9">market or maybe are charged very high</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="3.989">interest rates because of their low</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="5.549">scores now this whole transformation</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="4.171">this redevelopment of the credit scores</text>
  <text start="314.409" dur="4.411">well</text>

  <text start="336.4" dur="4.23">going to do the firm&amp;#39;s will remove the</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="4.17">adverse data if they don&amp;#39;t include</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="4.17">complete list of person&amp;#39;s name address</text>

  <text start="347.62" dur="4.799">judgments don&amp;#39;t include all three or</text>
  <text start="349.45" dur="5.34">four the effect will be like wiping the</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="4.351">slate clean for millions Americans now</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="4.34">how many Americans is this going to</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="6.51">affect this is going to affect 12</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="6.67">million Americans it will make many of</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="4.35">the people who&amp;#39;ve had very bad credit</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="5.1">because of this look like they have</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="6">better credit and with this credit they</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="4.71">can go out and purchase a car they can</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="5.009">purchase a house they can get a loan and</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.59">we can see right now this is the next</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="4.741">phase of what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="4.98">because they realize well we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="4.08">the illegal immigrants coming in anymore</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="5.15">which will add bodies and add debt to</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="7.2">individuals we&amp;#39;ve run the course after</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="6.07">nine years since 2008 we can&amp;#39;t bring any</text>
  <text start="394.66" dur="3.569">more of the low score people in to buy</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="3.93">automobiles because then it gets to a</text>
  <text start="398.229" dur="3.481">point where it&amp;#39;s way too low and guess</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="3.78">what they&amp;#39;re not just going to give a</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="4.139">loan so we need to change something and</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.4">this is why they&amp;#39;re doing it right now</text>
  <text start="405.849" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re changing the actual requirements</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="4.08">for the score because they need to get</text>
  <text start="411.4" dur="4.17">more debt into this and they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="4.139">right now just to prop it up for a</text>
  <text start="415.57" dur="4.409">little while longer because they realize</text>
  <text start="417.729" dur="4.351">what&amp;#39;s coming they realize they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="419.979" dur="4.801">let it go just yet we&amp;#39;re only in the</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="4.44">month of March it&amp;#39;s too soon so we can</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="4.08">see what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point and</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="4.74">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now we talked</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="4.26">about how the government is receiving</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="4.219">revenue and the tax receipts are</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="6.03">declining we have about six million</text>
  <text start="435.479" dur="5.741">fewer people that have filed for their</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="4.199">taxes right now you&amp;#39;ll see as we</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="4.8">approach April 15th where that number</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="5.581">Falls but it&amp;#39;s a lot less than last year</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="4.92">and we see right now that in</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="4.799">be wary the US Treasury brought in total</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="7.19">receipts of about 172 billion versus</text>
  <text start="453.729" dur="8.361">outlays of 364 billion resulting in a</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="7.03">deficit of about 192 billion more than</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="5.889">190 billion expected now for the fiscal</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="6.39">year through February 28th the total US</text>
  <text start="467.979" dur="5.581">budget deficit was 349 billion virtually</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="3.959">virtually identical to the three hundred</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="4.32">and fifty 1 billion deficit over the</text>
  <text start="475.509" dur="4.981">same period in 2016 and set to keep</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="6.24">rising this year and for the foreseeable</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="7.35">future on a 12 month run rate the u.s.</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="6.6">deficit stood at 3.1 percent of GDP a</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="6.24">year earlier that figure was a third</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="6.569">less about 2.2 percent now something</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="5.28">more concerning emerges when looking at</text>
  <text start="497.289" dur="5.011">the annual change in the rolling 12</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="5.94">month total this is where we find the</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="6.27">following like last month in the LTM</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="5.459">period ended February 28th total federal</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="4.86">revenues tracked as government receipts</text>
  <text start="510.759" dur="5.551">on the Treasury statement with 3.2 75</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="6.72">trillion this amount was 1.1 percent</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="6.359">lower than the 3.3 1 trillion reported</text>
  <text start="520.15" dur="4.83">one year ago and is the third</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="4.92">consecutive month of annual receipt</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="5.22">declines this was the biggest drop since</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="4.531">the summer of 2008 at the same time</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="4.62">government spending rose by 3.8 percent</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="4.68">now you&amp;#39;re listening to this and saying</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="6.33">well why is this all important well</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="6.69">every time since at least 1970 when</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="7.02">government receipts have turned negative</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="8.49">on an annual basis the u.s. was on the</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="5.4">cusp or already in a recession and the</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="6.33">last time government receipts turn</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="7.53">negative guess when that was July 2008</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="6.029">what does that tell you it tells us that</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="5.49">a recession since the beginning of last</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="6.39">year probably around the march time</text>
  <text start="569.829" dur="6.561">period and here we are in 2017 but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="6.589">all being covered up if we go back to</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="6.28">2008 the recession really started in</text>
  <text start="580.079" dur="5.261">2007 or getting close to the</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="4.65">point in the beginning of 2008 they were</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="4.29">touching upon the recession in July of</text>
  <text start="587.32" dur="5.04">2008 they were already in the recession</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="6.24">so the recession didn&amp;#39;t start in October</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="6.06">or April of 2009 it started way before</text>
  <text start="595.87" dur="5.28">that we&amp;#39;ve been in the recession now</text>
  <text start="598.42" dur="6.18">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Japan</text>
  <text start="601.15" dur="6.48">the EU and the Fed they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="4.65">tapering QE now of course the Fed says</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;ve already tapered they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="609.25" dur="3.39">doing QE but we know they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="5.01">covertly you know the EU is still</text>
  <text start="612.64" dur="5.94">pushing QE we know Japan is pushing QE</text>
  <text start="615.67" dur="5.4">but all the central bank&amp;#39;s decided to do</text>
  <text start="618.58" dur="5.55">this all together and what this means is</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the drugs which</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="4.44">tells us they&amp;#39;re ready to bring the</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="3.84">economy down now this economy is already</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="4.5">weak we&amp;#39;re in a recession we&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="629.95" dur="4.8">shown that we are in a recession we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="633.07" dur="3">been looking at all the economic</text>
  <text start="634.75" dur="5.07">indicators that are showing that we are</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="7.05">in a recession and each one builds upon</text>
  <text start="639.82" dur="5.13">the other almost like in 2008 when those</text>
  <text start="643.12" dur="4.35">individuals were looking at the subprime</text>
  <text start="644.95" dur="5.46">securities saying okay the triple-a</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="5.25">mortgages this whole thing is garbage</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="4.32">the real estate market it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="4.26">completely fold and implode on itself</text>
  <text start="654.73" dur="3.78">and when they looked at everything of</text>
  <text start="656.98" dur="2.58">course they had dates saying okay we</text>
  <text start="658.51" dur="2.61">think it&amp;#39;s gonna happen here and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="659.56" dur="3.66">like scratching their heads like how did</text>

  <text start="667.81" dur="4.86">eventually it did we went into the Great</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="4.38">Recession but they couldn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="672.67" dur="3.24">how they were able to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="674.68" dur="3.33">alive when everything was complete</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="4.95">garbage well the same things happening</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="4.38">now and behind the scenes people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="3.21">see what was happening they just thought</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="3.78">everything was gonna keep going the way</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="3.57">it was going today everyone believes</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="2.73">that everything&amp;#39;s gonna keep going the</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="3.09">way it&amp;#39;s going but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing that everything is falling</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="3.99">apart and falling apart rapidly and we</text>
  <text start="692.86" dur="3.54">can see what the Fed and the other</text>
  <text start="694.72" dur="5.55">central banks are preparing to do</text>
  <text start="696.4" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re going to stop the drugs and when</text>
  <text start="700.27" dur="5.58">you take someone off the drugs well</text>
  <text start="703.27" dur="3.18">guess what happens things start to go</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="3">wrong</text>
  <text start="706.45" dur="5.07">they would draw they can&amp;#39;t handle it</text>
  <text start="708.85" dur="4.89">their system implodes that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="5.04">going to happen here and we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="5.43">about what is happening in China in pass</text>
  <text start="716.56" dur="5.25">ports where we see that there&amp;#39;s a credit</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="4.68">problem UBS said that the credit impulse</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="5.25">is below zero it entered the negative</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="5.76">area signaling a huge problem we see</text>
  <text start="727.06" dur="4.62">Chinese credit relative to GDP well that</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="4.919">has doubled in the past decade to three</text>
  <text start="731.68" dur="5.51">hundred percent and the rate of Chinese</text>
  <text start="734.529" dur="5.371">credit is completely unsustainable and</text>
  <text start="737.19" dur="5.02">we really can&amp;#39;t reverse it without</text>
  <text start="739.9" dur="5.1">completely destroying the economy and we</text>
  <text start="742.21" dur="5.49">know that China has been continually</text>
  <text start="745" dur="6.15">keeping the credit markets continually</text>
  <text start="747.7" dur="5.84">flowing and at this point since the</text>
  <text start="751.15" dur="5.31">credit impulses bôla&amp;#39; dropped below zero</text>
  <text start="753.54" dur="4.6">into the negative territory it shows us</text>
  <text start="756.46" dur="4.8">that credits going to start freezing up</text>
  <text start="758.14" dur="5.25">and the World Bank is saying listen the</text>
  <text start="761.26" dur="4.71">entire global growth right now is</text>
  <text start="763.39" dur="5.25">slowing and we&amp;#39;re heading towards some</text>
  <text start="765.97" dur="5.16">type of depression because all of this</text>
  <text start="768.64" dur="4.98">new debt requires robust economic</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="4.59">strength to shoulder the weight and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="773.62" dur="4.74">just not there because the world the</text>
  <text start="775.72" dur="6.119">company&amp;#39;s global economy does not have</text>
  <text start="778.36" dur="5.58">the strength to shoulder this amount of</text>
  <text start="781.839" dur="4.741">debt that we have right now and the new</text>
  <text start="783.94" dur="3.899">debt that&amp;#39;s being piled on so from</text>
  <text start="786.58" dur="3.57">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="787.839" dur="3.931">with the lowered tax receipts coming</text>
  <text start="790.15" dur="3.93">into the government signaling every</text>
  <text start="791.77" dur="4.77">session from the credit impulse going</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="4.65">below zero from all the other economic</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="4.26">indicators we&amp;#39;re headed towards a</text>
  <text start="798.73" dur="4.68">collapse and the elite they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="800.8" dur="5.88">preparing for this all along they knew</text>
  <text start="803.41" dur="5.52">since 2008 that this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="806.68" dur="4.11">the central bank knew that this was</text>
  <text start="808.93" dur="3.99">going to happen because if there was not</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="3.39">a bailout at that time trillions and</text>
  <text start="812.92" dur="3.36">trillions and trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="814.18" dur="4.53">produced and given to all the banks</text>
  <text start="816.28" dur="4.86">given to all the other corporations</text>
