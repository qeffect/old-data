  <text start="117.42" dur="6.3">out this is home Capital Group and it</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="5.639">looks like the panic well is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="4.29">accelerating right and things are</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="4.23">actually getting worse on Friday the</text>
  <text start="128.01" dur="4.41">company revealed that high interest rate</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="6.051">saving account balances fell another 36</text>

  <text start="140.73" dur="4.8">million Thursday and more than two</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="5.61">billion a month ago in other words it</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="6.09">looks like the emergency loan the</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="5.55">bailout it is not working and we can see</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.16">at this point that this Bank is</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="5.54">completely insolvent and people are</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="4.92">running there to get their funds out and</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="6.19">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is things</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="5.16">are rapidly breaking apart and this is</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="3.539">one of the first signs that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="4.59">that things are dramatically changing</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing many other indicators</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.32">but this is right out there in your face</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="4.95">and this reminds me of like the Bear</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="4.56">Stearns moment where things rapidly</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="2.33">changed and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="2.18">right now</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="3.72">where things are starting to rapidly</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="3.899">change in the environment because all</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="3.99">along they&amp;#39;ve been telling us how great</text>
  <text start="186.409" dur="5.25">the housing market has been and how</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="4.799">great the retail market has been and how</text>
  <text start="191.659" dur="4.8">well the economy has been doing and</text>
  <text start="193.519" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing things just dramatically</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="4.411">change at a blink of an eye we see that</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="4.321">homeownership here in the United States</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="4.619">well it is continually falling now we</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="3.78">have to think to ourselves if</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="5.791">homeownership is continually falling who</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="5.67">is buying these homes what we know who</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="4.709">is buying these homes these are the</text>
  <text start="213.26" dur="5.67">hedge funds investment companies foreign</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="4.17">investors the everyday person here in</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="3.119">the United States is sitting on the</text>
  <text start="220.159" dur="4.621">sidelines saying I just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="222.049" dur="5.28">money to purchase this home and here is</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="4.819">the proof because the youngest age group</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="4.291">and this is the next generation</text>
  <text start="229.599" dur="3.341">thirty-five and younger where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.63">supposed to be going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.79">homes saying I&amp;#39;m starting my family I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="5.549">making a good living I have a good job</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="6.159">they&amp;#39;re not doing it they are not</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="6.601">purchasing homes why because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.889" dur="6.541">have the funds to do so they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="6.839">the job security they&amp;#39;re not making the</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="6.23">money like the previous generations this</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="5.43">is why things are dramatically changing</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.169">now right now the homeownership rate for</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="4.441">American thirty-five and younger slumped</text>
  <text start="261.829" dur="4.77">from thirty four point seven percent as</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="5.279">of December 2016 to thirty four point</text>
  <text start="266.599" dur="5.371">three percent in line with the lowest</text>
  <text start="269.389" dur="6.601">rate reported by the Census Bureau going</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="8.55">back nearly a quarter century this right</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="6.179">there is not a good situation and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="3.929">not going to help and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="6.841">other countries Cyprus Greece Italy</text>
  <text start="284.449" dur="7.71">France it&amp;#39;s the same exact pattern which</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="6.36">tells us that something is changing out</text>
  <text start="292.159" dur="6.151">there and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="4.68">things are rapidly deteriorating and if</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="2.97">we look at all these different sectors</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="3.299">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all these</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="4.71">economic sectors things are all</text>
  <text start="303.349" dur="4.521">contracting at the same time and then we</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="3.87">get the word from GDP from the</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="5.289">government where they put out the new</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.32">GDP number that is the worst GDP number</text>
  <text start="313.159" dur="1.591">that we&amp;#39;ve seen and that is the</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="3.12">manipulation</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="6.12">number this tells us that things are</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="6.24">rapidly deteriorating and we are heading</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="4.59">into this downward spiral where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.54" dur="4.68">just going to get worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="5.91">time goes on these bubbles are going to</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="5.82">pop the economy will not be able to be</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="5.25">sustained and when we look at these</text>
  <text start="334.04" dur="5.64">indicators we see that a lot of things</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="5.01">are going wrong all at once the weak</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="4.05">economic growth in the first quarter was</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="2.67">the continuation of a long-term trend</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="3.3">right now</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="4.95">Obama as we know was the only president</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="3.87">in history not to have a single year</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="4.53">when the US economy grew at least by</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.8">three percent and this is now the fourth</text>
  <text start="353.78" dur="4.68">time in the last six quarters when the</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="6.21">economic growth has been less than 2% on</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="6.15">an annualized basis and we see right now</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="4.35">Obama while he was president was telling</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="4.05">us that this was the best recovery ever</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="5.85">and he was handing off this incredible</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="6.06">economy to Trump now consumer spending</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="4.86">which drives the US economy more than</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="3.99">anything else at this point most US</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="4.92">consumers they&amp;#39;re completely tapped out</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="5.28">they have no funds left in fact CBS News</text>
  <text start="381.89" dur="5.4">has reported that three-fourths of all</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="6.39">US consumers have to scramble to cover</text>
  <text start="387.29" dur="5.46">their living costs each month the job</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="4.44">market appears to be slowing the US</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="4.38">economy only added ninety eight thousand</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="4.26">jobs in March and that was approximately</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="4.83">half of what most analysts were</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="5.7">expecting gee this does make sense</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="4.83">because how many retailers have closed</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="4.02">how many retails have laid off</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="4.5">individuals corporations or laying off</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="4.38">and we&amp;#39;re continually saying this the</text>
  <text start="411.29" dur="4.89">flow of credit appears to be slowing as</text>
  <text start="413.18" dur="5.82">well in fact this is the first time</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="5.19">since the last recession when there has</text>
  <text start="419" dur="5.37">been no growth for commercial and</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="3.96">industrial lending for at least six</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="4.799">months</text>
  <text start="425.33" dur="7.11">last month US factory output dropped at</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="5.521">the fastest pace that we&amp;#39;ve witnessed in</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="5.37">more than two years and we know that</text>
  <text start="434.69" dur="5.52">retail well that is just completely a</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.56">disaster even the corporate media called</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="3.75">it the retail apocalypse and of course</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="3.99">they try to smooth this over saying well</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="3.51">this is a sign that everything is moving</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="2.11">to online and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="447.47" dur="2.86">brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="4.56">is doing so poorly but we know that</text>
  <text start="450.33" dur="4.98">online sales is only a tenth of the</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="4.65">retail sales and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="5.28">now this year just the first part of</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.37">this year we see more retailers that</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="3.99">have declared bankruptcy than at any</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="3.93">other time and if we project this out</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="3.99">and we go throughout this entire year we</text>
  <text start="466.98" dur="3.72">can see that we&amp;#39;re going to see more</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="4.35">store closing and the default rate and</text>
  <text start="470.7" dur="4.65">the number of bankruptcies I should say</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="4.71">is going to skyrocket by the end of this</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="5.49">year the order industry is also</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="5.55">experiencing a great deal of stress this</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.98">has been the worst for US automakers</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="5.13">since the last recession seven out of</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="5.34">eight largest fell short of their sales</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="5.64">projections in March and then when we</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="5.46">look at used car prices well those are</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="4.68">declining at a rapid rate actually</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="4.62">Morgan Stanley was out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.23">projecting that used vehicle prices well</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="2.91">they could crash up to 50 percent over</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="4.38">the next several years</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="5.19">commercial bankruptcies they&amp;#39;re rising</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.04">at the fastest pace since the last</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="5.55">recession consumer bankruptcies same</text>
  <text start="512.28" dur="5.91">thing rising at the fastest pace since</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="5.699">the last recession and then we have the</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="5.37">student loan bubble well that&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="520.589" dur="5.161">burst it&amp;#39;s reported at 27% of all</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="5.76">student loans all already in default and</text>
  <text start="525.75" dur="7.29">it is getting worse now goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="5.88">was out there and they are warning that</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="4.59">the gap between stock investors hopes</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="4.79">and reality is glow is close to an</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="4.44">all-time high where these two things</text>
  <text start="539.99" dur="5.349">they&amp;#39;re heading in completely different</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="7.2">directions and when we look at the New</text>
  <text start="545.339" dur="6.331">York Fed now cast that now cast included</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.35">soft data compared to the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="5.4">where they were looking at the hard data</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="5.01">and then we have reality which is really</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="3.57">what the Atlanta Fed was reporting on</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="5.1">and these two things are completely</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="6.449">separate and apart and we can see right</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="6.18">now that as we move along the economy</text>
  <text start="567.089" dur="6.361">it&amp;#39;s going to continually deteriorate it</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="6.24">is basically contracting and imploding</text>
  <text start="573.45" dur="6.78">on itself right now and we can see at</text>
  <text start="576.15" dur="5.41">this point that time is tickin away here</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="2.589">and from</text>
  <text start="581.56" dur="3.66">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at and</text>
  <text start="582.819" dur="5.901">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been tracking we</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="5.609">can see the pace has picked up right now</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="4.39">actually if we go back and we saw how</text>
  <text start="590.829" dur="3.57">many stores were closing down it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="3.269">really that many and how many</text>
  <text start="594.399" dur="4.35">bankruptcies there were really not that</text>
  <text start="596.379" dur="3.721">many when we look at the GDP numbers we</text>
  <text start="598.749" dur="3.991">can see they are continually declining</text>
  <text start="600.1" dur="4.979">because what happened was during the</text>
  <text start="602.74" dur="4.86">last recession the Fed was able to pump</text>
  <text start="605.079" dur="5.341">everything up just like a druggie who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="4.62">on drugs they&amp;#39;re pumped up with drugs</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="4.079">they&amp;#39;re feeling great and then they</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="4.14">start coming off of it and the only way</text>
  <text start="614.499" dur="5.101">to feel good again is to pump up with</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="4.62">more drugs well the Fed right now even</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="4.669">though they&amp;#39;re doing things covertly</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="6.75">they need to increase the stimulus</text>
  <text start="624.269" dur="6.37">dramatically to pump this economy up and</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="5.25">we can see by them raising the interest</text>
  <text start="630.639" dur="5.521">rates by them holding back on the</text>
  <text start="632.98" dur="5.339">stimulus without giving the the economy</text>
  <text start="636.16" dur="5.94">even more free money we can see they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="638.319" dur="6.12">already started the entire destruction</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="4.109">of the economy and there is a battle</text>
  <text start="644.439" dur="4.171">going on right now between the central</text>
  <text start="646.209" dur="3.99">bank and the Trump administration on who</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="3.599">is going to bring this economy down</text>
  <text start="650.199" dur="3.93">first because as you can see with Trump</text>
  <text start="652.209" dur="3.75">right now he wants more spending he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.129" dur="3.781">trying to pump up these bubbles the</text>
  <text start="655.959" dur="5.401">central bank is doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="657.91" dur="5.64">thing whoever is the winner will control</text>
  <text start="661.36" dur="4.169">the narrative of how the economy</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="5.789">actually fell apart and who is</text>
  <text start="665.529" dur="6.36">responsible because for example if Trump</text>
  <text start="669.339" dur="4.081">and his administration is the winner of</text>
  <text start="671.889" dur="3.781">bringing down the economy and is that</text>
  <text start="673.42" dur="4.139">really a winner no but he was able to do</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="4.919">it he can turn around and say listen</text>
  <text start="677.559" dur="6.33">these were all the things that the</text>
  <text start="680.589" dur="6.12">central bank wanted us to do they wanted</text>
  <text start="683.889" dur="5.341">more spending they wanted more free</text>
  <text start="686.709" dur="5.22">money out there this is how they did it</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="5.279">they pumped up the bubbles and they are</text>
  <text start="691.929" dur="5.4">responsible for doing all this because</text>
  <text start="694.509" dur="5.01">they raise the interest rates during the</text>
  <text start="697.329" dur="4.23">weakest economy ever I mean he can just</text>
  <text start="699.519" dur="4.26">turn around and say look at the GDP why</text>
  <text start="701.559" dur="4.77">would you raise interest rates where GDP</text>
  <text start="703.779" dur="4.17">was what point five percent it makes no</text>
  <text start="706.329" dur="4.591">sense why would you raise it if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="707.949" dur="4.921">around 0.7% why would you begin raising</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="4.09">it at the point they started to raise it</text>
  <text start="712.87" dur="4.089">because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="715.01" dur="4.92">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="716.959" dur="4.831">there is a race now now the fact is is</text>
  <text start="719.93" dur="3.149">that this economy is coming down one way</text>
  <text start="721.79" dur="2.64">or another and everyone needs to be</text>
  <text start="723.079" dur="3.181">prepared and ready for what is going to</text>
  <text start="724.43" dur="4.56">happen here because once the system</text>
  <text start="726.26" dur="4.11">comes down we know from everything that</text>
  <text start="728.99" dur="2.82">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at from the balland</text>
  <text start="730.37" dur="3.959">documents and what they&amp;#39;ve done in other</text>
  <text start="731.81" dur="3.93">countries basically the currency most</text>
  <text start="734.329" dur="2.851">likely is going to disappear there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.74" dur="3.599">going to be capital controls banks are</text>
  <text start="737.18" dur="4.14">going to shut down supplies to stores</text>
  <text start="739.339" dur="4.56">well they&amp;#39;re not going to flow because</text>
  <text start="741.32" dur="4.86">credit is going to freeze up and the</text>
  <text start="743.899" dur="5.011">dollar is going to lose value very very</text>
  <text start="746.18" dur="5.13">quickly as we see hyperinflation pour in</text>
  <text start="748.91" dur="3.869">and we can see that many people are not</text>
  <text start="751.31" dur="3.149">going to be prepared and ready for what</text>
  <text start="752.779" dur="3.841">is about to happen here and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="754.459" dur="3.841">going to run to the stores because they</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="4.05">won&amp;#39;t understand what is happening and</text>
  <text start="758.3" dur="4.229">they realize that okay I need to get as</text>
  <text start="760.67" dur="4.14">many supplies as possibly can because I</text>
  <text start="762.529" dur="3.87">can see every single day that the price</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="4.019">of goods are going up which merely means</text>
  <text start="766.399" dur="4.201">the dollar value is continually dropping</text>
  <text start="768.829" dur="3.87">and we can see right now the government</text>
  <text start="770.6" dur="5.01">is having their own problems people are</text>
  <text start="772.699" dur="5.07">scrambling all over the country and we</text>
  <text start="775.61" dur="4.43">can see at this point that if you were</text>
  <text start="777.769" dur="5.82">not ready for this if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="7.51">gold silver cash on hand because you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="783.589" dur="6.421">use that first to basically buy your</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="4.469">supplies until cash can no longer be</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="3.93">used you&amp;#39;ll need a weapon to protect</text>
