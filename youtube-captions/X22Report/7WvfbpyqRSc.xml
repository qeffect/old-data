  <text start="35.56" dur="6.51">episode 924 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="38.62" dur="5.7">21st 2016 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="42.07" dur="5.73">nothing has changed the global economic</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="5.46">problems are hidden in the shadows let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.8" dur="4.74">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.78" dur="5.31">financial news let&amp;#39;s head on out to</text>
  <text start="52.54" dur="4.83">Greece and we understand out in Greece</text>
  <text start="55.09" dur="5.31">that the situation has not improved</text>
  <text start="57.37" dur="5.04">whatsoever we know that the ECB is</text>
  <text start="60.4" dur="6.27">calling to phase out the five hundred</text>
  <text start="62.41" dur="5.67">dollar euro and we know here in the</text>
  <text start="66.67" dur="4.89">United States are looking to get rid of</text>
  <text start="68.08" dur="6.93">the 100-dollar bill and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="71.56" dur="4.95">this agenda to try to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="75.01" dur="4.62">that we need to go to a cashless society</text>
  <text start="76.51" dur="6.09">now remember out in Greece the people</text>
  <text start="79.63" dur="5.79">were very very nervous and they decided</text>
  <text start="82.6" dur="6.99">to take their currency out of the bank</text>
  <text start="85.42" dur="7.17">and a lot of them took these 500 euro</text>
  <text start="89.59" dur="3.9">notes and they stored them away outside</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="3.99">of the bank because they were afraid</text>
  <text start="93.49" dur="4.74">that what happened in Cyprus were they</text>
  <text start="96.58" dur="4.95">had balance it was going to happen in</text>
  <text start="98.23" dur="5.46">Greece and they took all of their funds</text>
  <text start="101.53" dur="6.24">out of the bank&amp;#39;s because they were very</text>
  <text start="103.69" dur="5.91">nervous about this so right now the</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="4.14">Greeks who attempt to exchange their</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="4.83">five hundred dollar euro note for</text>
  <text start="111.91" dur="4.77">smaller bills will now have their</text>
  <text start="114.43" dur="4.05">transaction and personal data recorded</text>
  <text start="116.68" dur="6.09">by the bank and they&amp;#39;re also getting</text>
  <text start="118.48" dur="7.17">charged to hand in their five hundred</text>
  <text start="122.77" dur="4.56">dollar note because they heard that</text>
  <text start="125.65" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to be getting rid of it it</text>
  <text start="127.33" dur="4.019">will be obsolete and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="3.48">exchange it at this point so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.349" dur="4.051">trying to keep track of all these people</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.95">who have their currency outside of the</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="3.63">bank now of course they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="5.07">saying well this is for record keeping</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="6.09">no it&amp;#39;s to track and to remember who has</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="4.769">this so when the time comes they can go</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="4.199">after those people and it might be a</text>
  <text start="147.819" dur="6.541">good idea for all of you who were</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="6.901">storing cash in a nice place where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="4.14">hidden from everyone else to keep</text>
  <text start="156.22" dur="5.19">smaller bills don&amp;#39;t keep such large</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="5.28">bills keep smaller bills and this way</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="5.58">makes it a lot easier to</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="4.83">purchase things later on so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="4.95">have to use these larger bills and if</text>
  <text start="168.61" dur="5.19">they do a recall of larger bills you can</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="3.78">still hold on to the smaller bills and</text>
  <text start="173.8" dur="5.909">you should still also have gold and</text>
  <text start="175.72" dur="8.19">silver to protect your wealth now we see</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="6.931">the eurozone consumer confidence it</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="5.52">defied market expectations now they</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="5.97">thought that the eurozone consumer</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="5.43">confidence was going to do a lot better</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="4.19">than it actually did the Commission said</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="5.22">consumer confidence in the 19 countries</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="4.78">sharing the euro fell point nine points</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="4.439">to negative nine point seven in march</text>
  <text start="201.58" dur="5.31">against februari and was point seven</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="4.911">points lower at negative seven point</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="6.929">three in the wider 28-nation european</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.77">union and we see consumer confidence not</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="3.931">just in Europe but in the United States</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="4.259">it is also dropped because people are</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="4.23">starting to realize there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="4.761">majorly wrong with the economies that</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="5.88">things are not right there&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="6.76">unemployment there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="5.4">debt and things are not improving yet</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="3.9">you might see the stock market going up</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="3.539">but that&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="3.93">controlled to keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="4.761">but the real economic indicators are</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="5.82">showing us that things are not really</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.459">improving whatsoever now Moody&amp;#39;s came</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="5.52">out and they said the eurozone debt is</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="5.951">going to barely fall by the end of the</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="6.149">decade and translation to that is that</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="5.85">the debt is going to rise as we move</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="4.5">forward because guess what more of these</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="4.11">countries as more and more people are</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="4.291">unemployed will not have revenue coming</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="4.95">into the country they will need more of</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.68">the debt just like Greece just like</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="6.21">Cyprus just like Portugal just like</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="6.39">France and this will continue on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="4.32">no way that they can start paying this</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="4.62">down and this is why they always push it</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="4.29">out like oh yes don&amp;#39;t worry after a</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="6.24">decade they&amp;#39;ll be able to pay this off</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="6.06">no they won&amp;#39;t go back to 2008 has it</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="4.38">gotten any better have these countries</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="5.25">paid off the debt well yes in Iceland</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="4.44">when they threw all the bankers and the</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="3.09">corrupt politicians and they wiped out a</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="3.18">lot of the debt</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="3.75">started to create their own currency</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="4.08">without the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="3.51">yes their currency improved but if</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="3.38">they&amp;#39;re still controlled with the</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="5.36">private western central bank guess what</text>
  <text start="306.48" dur="6.64">each one of these countries are doomed</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="6.16">now here in the States we see existing</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.14">home sales they have plunged by seven</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="4.14">point one percent month a month in</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="5.31">February they massively missed</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="5.34">expectations they thought it was only</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="5.79">going to be a three percent drop so when</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="5.61">we look back in time we saw that in the</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="5.4">beginning of the year or towards the end</text>
  <text start="330.97" dur="5.4">of 2015 we had this huge surge of</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="5.85">existing home sales and now it dropped</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="5.49">right back down to where it was and if</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="7.14">you look at existing home sales new home</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="7.92">sales they have gone absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="5.37">they pump it up and it could falls right</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="5.31">back down now we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="6.81">the median prices are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="6.45">now and it&amp;#39;s as time goes on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="5.7">still there continually declining I look</text>
  <text start="361.54" dur="8.25">around the country and I&amp;#39;m noticing that</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="8.88">in in the East northern eastern area the</text>
  <text start="369.79" dur="8.07">Midwest the West people have their homes</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="8.84">on the market longer and longer the</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="6.78">prices are continually coming down</text>
  <text start="382.35" dur="6.28">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="384.64" dur="6.9">that this is a housing bubble this</text>
  <text start="388.63" dur="5.55">bubble was created not by the people</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re sitting on the sidelines this</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.64">was created by the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="4.83">instructed the banks and said listen do</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="5.13">not let the foreclosures hit the market</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="5.13">keep them off the market we had hedge</text>
  <text start="404.95" dur="5.28">funds investment companies purchasing</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="5.37">thousands and thousands of homes holding</text>
  <text start="410.23" dur="5.57">on to them renting them out the Fed</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="7.68">bought up trillions of toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="6.99">this whole thing was created by the</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="6">central bank to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="422.79" dur="6.76">that we are absolutely fine and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="4.62">nothing wrong with the economy so what</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="3.54">is an economic bubble</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="4.8">well it&amp;#39;s a market phenomenon</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="5.31">characterized by surgeons in asset</text>
  <text start="435.79" dur="5.82">prices to levels significantly above the</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="5.45">fundamental value of that asset and we</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.8">are definitely in another housing bubble</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="4.81">first most Americans can&amp;#39;t afford to buy</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="5.22">a home without utilizing artificially</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="6.09">low interest rates and even then they</text>
  <text start="451.63" dur="5.28">are stretching their budgets that like</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="6.12">like a big rubber band they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="6.84">do it second home prices are surging in</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="4.89">the face of stagnant household incomes</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="3.78">as more and more people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="465.76" dur="4.41">as more and more people get part-time</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="4.89">jobs we notice that household incomes</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="5.01">are stagnant they&amp;#39;re not going up people</text>
  <text start="472.42" dur="5.16">are not getting raises so how are</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="5.76">housing prices continually going up it</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="6.51">makes no sense this is the biggest sign</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="6.45">of a bubble the underlying asset in</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="7.65">housing is moving up even though incomes</text>
  <text start="487.39" dur="6.9">are not so what&amp;#39;s driving the prices up</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="7.5">well you know what it is speculation</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="6.38">flipping hedge funds investors where</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re just coming into the market</text>
  <text start="500.67" dur="4.83">doing whatever they possibly can to hold</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="4.83">on to the houses not sell them flip them</text>
  <text start="505.5" dur="8.32">we saw this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="8.36">and we see it happening once again this</text>
  <text start="513.82" dur="6.56">is the ultimate sign of a housing bubble</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="9.51">home ownership right now is near</text>
  <text start="520.38" dur="11.04">generational lows and we can see that as</text>
  <text start="525.75" dur="10.84">home prices increase incomes are falling</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="10.26">we see housing prices going up new home</text>
  <text start="536.59" dur="10.91">sales existing home sales falling</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="10.57">something isn&amp;#39;t right this market is</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="6.67">completely manipulated and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="5.39">even make sense this is why traffic</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="6.3">right now is drying up in the major</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="5.35">areas now remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="560.47" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t touch every single area in the</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="3.84">country</text>
  <text start="564.19" dur="4.8">concentrate on certain cities and they</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="4.08">take all their force and they put it</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="5.4">into those cities the rest of the</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="5.16">country that&amp;#39;s where the real economic</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="3.93">indicator that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="576.07" dur="4.65">happening and when you look in certain</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="4.65">areas you can see it you see that there</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="4.11">is no traffic you see people having</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="3.06">their homes on the market longer and</text>
  <text start="584.83" dur="3.69">longer and there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="586.03" dur="6.18">writing in to me telling me yes in my</text>
  <text start="588.52" dur="5.49">area I do see this now where prices are</text>
  <text start="592.21" dur="4.64">coming down they can&amp;#39;t move the houses</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="6.3">and it is getting worse and not better</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="5.38">the Baltic Dry Index is at 398 it</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="4.47">climbed about three points we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="602.23" dur="6.6">that it&amp;#39;s hovering right at the 400 mark</text>
  <text start="604.78" dur="8.1">right now and we see the Chicago&amp;#39;s feds</text>
  <text start="608.83" dur="7.11">national activity index now this is a</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="6.63">gauge to let us know how the overall</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="6.6">economic activities doing and it plunged</text>
  <text start="619.51" dur="9.57">back into contraction at negative point</text>
  <text start="622.54" dur="9.18">29 near two-year lows so it&amp;#39;s signaling</text>
  <text start="629.08" dur="4.62">us along with all the other economic</text>
  <text start="631.72" dur="5.13">indicators letting us know that this</text>
  <text start="633.7" dur="5.76">economy that we&amp;#39;re in right now it is</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="3.96">not improving whatsoever the only thing</text>
  <text start="639.46" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s improving if you really think</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="7.8">about it is the market and the</text>
  <text start="644.53" dur="6.66">suppression of precious metals it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="5.7">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="6.66">fine and they don&amp;#39;t report on anything</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="6.36">else that&amp;#39;s going on in the economy now</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="6.92">we&amp;#39;re starting to hear from a lot of the</text>
  <text start="660.67" dur="7.29">banks that their clients are not</text>
  <text start="664.77" dur="5.11">believing this rally bank of america we</text>
  <text start="667.96" dur="4.02">reported on this that clients don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="4.89">believe the rally they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="5.55">selling stocks the smart money is</text>
  <text start="674.77" dur="4.71">getting out of the market right now the</text>
  <text start="677.53" dur="4.14">central bank they&amp;#39;re pumping it up</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="4.89">trying to get people into the market and</text>
  <text start="681.67" dur="4.169">it&amp;#39;s not working and we see the</text>
  <text start="684.37" dur="4.14">high-frequency traders the plunge</text>
  <text start="685.839" dur="5.791">protection team they&amp;#39;re basically the</text>
  <text start="688.51" dur="6.45">market at this time and we see out of</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="6.38">JPMorgan investors are yanking more</text>
  <text start="694.96" dur="5.78">money out of equities</text>
  <text start="698.01" dur="5.25">and when you look at this thus more</text>
  <text start="700.74" dur="5.28">money has now sold stocks in the face of</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="8.39">this bear market rally for a near-record</text>
  <text start="706.02" dur="9.69">seven consecutive weeks so the question</text>
  <text start="711.65" dur="7.15">everyone should be asking is has</text>
  <text start="715.71" dur="4.71">anything really changed in the economy</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="4.11">in the last three months because we</text>
