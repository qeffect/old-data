  <text start="156.799" dur="6.151">spend their money well the latest answer</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="7.73">to all of these questions came yesterday</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="10.22">from a Fed data analysis by the young</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="9.25">invincibles group according to this</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="8.68">analysis we see the median household</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="6.06">income is around 40,000 581 dollars now</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="4.41">despite being better</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="5.399">educated Millennials now earn twenty</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="5.88">percent less than boomers did at the</text>
  <text start="188.689" dur="5.701">same stage of life in 1989 who earned</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="6.45">fifty thousand nine hundred and ten some</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.73">25 years ago the analysis that was</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="3.269">released on Friday shows other</text>
  <text start="200.12" dur="5.31">disturbing trends which confirm that</text>
  <text start="201.859" dur="7.41">America&amp;#39;s troubling generation well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="6.57">real Millennials right now have half of</text>
  <text start="209.269" dur="5.28">the net worth of boomers their home</text>
  <text start="212" dur="7.29">ownership rate is lower their student</text>
  <text start="214.549" dur="6.181">debt is dramatically higher and what</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now these individuals</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="5.22">that are graduating college they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="5.219">find jobs they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="3.689">high-paying jobs and this is why the</text>
  <text start="228.169" dur="2.79">government had to step in with their</text>
  <text start="229.639" dur="3.66">student loans and said listen we&amp;#39;ll base</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="3.96">your student loans off of your income</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="3.901">and we&amp;#39;ll divide it over what 30 years</text>
  <text start="234.919" dur="6.72">or so this is why many of them are</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="6.539">living with their parents and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.639" dur="3.811">seeing right now is the medium net worth</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="4.59">of Millennials is around ten thousand</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="5.49">ninety dollars fifty six percent less</text>
  <text start="248.329" dur="4.111">than it was for boomers so when people</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="4.53">talk about all the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="6.09">better everything&amp;#39;s fantastic it really</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="5.4">isn&amp;#39;t not for this generation and this</text>
  <text start="258.53" dur="5.55">generation is supposed to be the</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="5.16">generation that carries us into this</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="3.54">next economic boom which is not</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="3.389">happening whatsoever because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="4.53">supposed to buy houses they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="269.419" dur="4.53">to buy retail goods as opposed to get</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="4.199">jobs they supposed to make a better</text>
  <text start="273.949" dur="5.46">living they&amp;#39;re highly educated but</text>
  <text start="276.349" dur="5.581">they&amp;#39;re not seeing this at all actually</text>
  <text start="279.409" dur="6.721">the opposite is happening right now that</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="6.84">is what we are seeing now out in Davos</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="5.94">Switzerland we understand the globalists</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="5.13">are all meeting there and the Trump team</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.64">right now is saying they are not going</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="5.07">to attend Davos and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="3.66">are saying this and the reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="4.68">giving is that the president elect</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="4.979">Donald Trump said it would betray his</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="5.16">populist fueled movement to have a</text>
  <text start="306.349" dur="5.161">presence at the high powered annual</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="5.25">gathering in the Swiss Alps but China</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="4.6">they are out there and they are pushing</text>
  <text start="314.06" dur="4.96">the globalist agenda</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="6.24">we see ye Jin ping will promote</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="5.79">inclusive globalization and will warn</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="6.03">that populist approaches can lead to war</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="6.54">and poverty so we can see that there is</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="4.74">a complete set up where most likely and</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="3.6">I know people talking about the SDR and</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="6.33">everything like this but it seems at</text>
  <text start="334.95" dur="9.15">this point that China still might become</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="6.99">the global currency of the world because</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="4.95">thing about what has happened they moved</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="5.25">everything from west to east they</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.73">duplicated everything from west to east</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="6.93">they have a duplicate payment system</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="6.39">they have duplicate exchanges they are</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="6.39">now included in the SDR and it looks</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="6.6">like they&amp;#39;re building up to become the</text>
  <text start="365.01" dur="7.77">world reserve currency but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="7.8">see how this all plays out now there was</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="7.17">a petition out there where they were</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="8.37">saying they want Snowden pardon and it</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="5.16">reached 1 million signatures and it</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="3.14">looks like right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="6.47">listen we hit the 1 million signatures</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="8.41">now it&amp;#39;s time for Obama to go ahead and</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="6.64">pardon Snowden will he do it well we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="5.46">have to wait and see he&amp;#39;s got about five</text>
  <text start="398.22" dur="4.74">days left in office and we&amp;#39;ll see if he</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="3.84">actually does it personally I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="5.34">think he will I believe he thinks he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="5.76">traitor he exposed what the spying</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="5.4">apparatus was really doing violating</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="5.43">everyone&amp;#39;s rights and but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="4.32">wait and see what he does now the</text>
  <text start="415.98" dur="4.65">Clinton Foundation well they&amp;#39;re shutting</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="5.91">down their Clinton Global Initiative the</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="5.34">laying off 22 employees and the reason</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="4.41">why they&amp;#39;re doing this and this is</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="4.44">coming out of the Warren notice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.89">saying it is a discontinuation of the</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="5.43">Clinton Global Initiative and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="4.74">just stopping it now is this because the</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="4.98">Department of Justice decided to move</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="5.37">ahead with the investigation FBI is</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="4.53">releasing more information who knows</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="4.02">maybe they&amp;#39;re covering everything up but</text>
  <text start="445.35" dur="4.45">this is what they decided to do at this</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.049">point Joe Biden he is</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="5.549">visiting Ukraine right now on January</text>
  <text start="452.409" dur="6.781">sixteenth he will meet with poroshenko</text>
  <text start="455.349" dur="5.701">and we do have to remember that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="4.83">paid about five billion dollars to have</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="6.299">a coup d&amp;#39;etat to remove the elected</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="5.429">president put in a puppet president into</text>
  <text start="467.349" dur="5.88">the country take over their natural</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="6.21">resources obtain a strategic location</text>
  <text start="473.229" dur="4.171">but it didn&amp;#39;t go as planned they were</text>
  <text start="475.659" dur="3.781">hoping to get Crimea they were hoping to</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.56">get a port on the Black Sea they were</text>
  <text start="479.44" dur="3.719">hoping to get the southeastern region</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="3.6">with all the production and</text>
  <text start="483.159" dur="4.081">manufacturing control the pipelines and</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="5.069">none of it happened and we have to</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="5.01">remember Joe Biden put his son on the</text>
  <text start="490.629" dur="3.961">board of directors of the gas company</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="4.259">inside of Ukraine once the coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="3.99">was complete he&amp;#39;s going back out there</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="3.451">to check on his investments and who</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="5.1">knows maybe they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="4.889">something much different Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="4.049">out there speaking to The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="504.849" dur="5.04">Journal he said that relations with</text>
  <text start="507.729" dur="4.44">China and Russia well that will depend</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="5.371">on the degree to which the two countries</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="7.021">cooperate with the US diplomatically</text>
  <text start="515.26" dur="8.639">economically and militarily he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="7.98">that he might remove the sanctions from</text>
  <text start="523.899" dur="5.791">Russia as long as they&amp;#39;re helpful in</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="5.909">battling terrorists and reaching other</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="4.62">goals important to the US and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.079" dur="4.081">very interesting about all this is that</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="5.339">is Russia who is battling the terrorists</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="4.98">United States is not battling the teryx</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="5.281">the United States is supporting the</text>
  <text start="542.14" dur="4.259">terrorists so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that</text>
  <text start="544.93" dur="3.12">works out now we understand that</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="3.571">President Obama recalled all aircraft</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="3.72">carriers back to the United States and</text>
  <text start="549.97" dur="4.35">everyone thought that was really strange</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="3.75">was a big setup and there were two</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="3.6">scenarios here they were bringing the</text>
  <text start="555.52" dur="5.55">back for this main event or they were</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="5.07">reloading and rearming all the ships and</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="3.99">it looks like it might have been that</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="5.279">they were rearming the ships and then</text>
  <text start="565.06" dur="6.54">sending them back out to sea because</text>
  <text start="568.269" dur="6.75">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="571.6" dur="6.12">u.s. is setting back the Carl Vinson</text>
  <text start="575.019" dur="5.611">Carrier Strike Group they are leaving</text>
  <text start="577.72" dur="4.79">San Diego and they&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="6.16">the south</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="7.41">China Sea area now the USS Carl Vinson</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="7.51">that is the aircraft carrier it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="8.64">nimitz-class they also have Destroyer</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="5.82">Squadron and other ships with it and we</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="4.05">can see right now it&amp;#39;s headed to this</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="4.77">area we don&amp;#39;t know what is planned at</text>
  <text start="602.61" dur="6.18">this point in time but this is something</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="6.66">to watch we see that the military up in</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="5.13">Poland and the whole Eastern Europe area</text>
  <text start="611.55" dur="4.32">we can see that those NATO generals the</text>
  <text start="613.92" dur="6.84">u.s. generals they are saying that they</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="7.17">are ready for war with Russia and we</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="5.33">have to remember Russia has not</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="5.9">attempted to have war with anyone</text>
  <text start="626.09" dur="5.62">actually they&amp;#39;re doing actually no</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="5.26">provocations whatsoever every time the</text>
  <text start="631.71" dur="5.07">US and the neocons the elite the central</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="4.71">bankers try to push war Putin is on the</text>
  <text start="636.78" dur="4.44">other side saying listen let&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="6.06">peace here and there are numerous</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="6.54">examples of how many times he has had to</text>
  <text start="644.97" dur="5.28">do this and if you notice Russia doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.76" dur="4.1">go into each country with troops think</text>
  <text start="650.25" dur="4.23">about what the United States is doing</text>
  <text start="651.86" dur="4.75">they move troops into a country they</text>
  <text start="654.48" dur="6.54">pretend there&amp;#39;s terrorism there they</text>
  <text start="656.61" dur="5.7">garrison the country and with other</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="4.77">countries they go in and they have</text>

  <text start="673.11" dur="5.91">with heavy military they are in there</text>
  <text start="676.59" dur="4.11">for economic purposes the same thing for</text>

  <text start="680.7" dur="5.49">China they&amp;#39;re perfect that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="683.07" dur="4.86">part of the system all these countries</text>
  <text start="686.19" dur="4.8">are part of the system in one way or</text>
  <text start="687.93" dur="7.5">another but are they part of the private</text>
  <text start="690.99" dur="6.81">western central bank system well we know</text>
  <text start="695.43" dur="4.47">that Putin decided to take control of</text>
  <text start="697.8" dur="3.96">his own central bank China on the other</text>
  <text start="699.9" dur="5.01">hand it looks like it might be so</text>
  <text start="701.76" dur="5.19">intertwined in that system but you have</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="4.23">to remember those individuals in the</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="4.53">United States they don&amp;#39;t want to give up</text>
  <text start="709.14" dur="5.29">control and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ll fight</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="6.78">because it is a war again</text>
  <text start="714.43" dur="6.9">what system were going to be using and</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="4.81">they keep talking about a Russian threat</text>
  <text start="721.33" dur="4.83">a Russian threat and Paul Craig Roberts</text>
  <text start="723.07" dur="6.18">is out there and he explains why Obama</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="6.36">continually says this so when Obama says</text>
  <text start="729.25" dur="4.5">Russia continues to pose an unusual and</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="2.64">extraordinary threat to the national</text>
  <text start="733.75" dur="3.87">security and foreign policy of the</text>
  <text start="735.16" dur="5.13">United States he doesn&amp;#39;t really mean</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="5.55">that Russia is a threat in the ordinary</text>
  <text start="740.29" dur="6.51">meaning of the word to understand what</text>
  <text start="743.17" dur="6.21">Obama really means by threat it is</text>
  <text start="746.8" dur="4.2">necessary to understand what the foreign</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="3.84">policy of the United States really is</text>
  <text start="751" dur="4.92">and the foreign policy of the US is to</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="5.73">establish American hegemony over the</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="5.88">world now Russia and China well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.95" dur="5.91">immune from an American invasion and</text>
  <text start="761.8" dur="5.099">they do have the capability to destroy</text>
  <text start="764.86" dur="5.16">the entirety of the United States with</text>
  <text start="766.899" dur="5.161">their nuclear weapons and both countries</text>
  <text start="770.02" dur="7.11">are capable of standing up to Washington</text>
  <text start="772.06" dur="8.279">and this is what Obama is really talking</text>
  <text start="777.13" dur="6">about that they can&amp;#39;t control these two</text>
  <text start="780.339" dur="7.561">countries and this is why he continually</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="7.59">says Russia is a threat now during the</text>
  <text start="787.9" dur="6.54">inauguration there are many different</text>
  <text start="790.72" dur="6.41">groups out in DC and we see anarchists</text>
  <text start="794.44" dur="6.03">plan to stop the Trump pense regime</text>
  <text start="797.13" dur="6.07">anyway they possibly can and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="4.41">taking out full-page ads out in the New</text>
  <text start="803.2" dur="3.84">York Times and many other newspapers</text>
  <text start="804.88" dur="4.89">where they&amp;#39;re saying stop the Trump pens</text>
  <text start="807.04" dur="5.37">regime before it starts we opposed to</text>
  <text start="809.77" dur="4.89">fascism and they&amp;#39;re all out there you</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="4.2">know screaming and yelling and it looks</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="5.85">like that they&amp;#39;re not just going to</text>
  <text start="816.61" dur="5.64">protest they want to completely halt the</text>
  <text start="820.51" dur="4.019">entire inauguration of me Rosie</text>
  <text start="822.25" dur="4.44">O&amp;#39;Donnell&amp;#39;s out there and she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="824.529" dur="5.55">that I fully support imposing martial</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="6.87">law delaying the inauguration so what</text>
  <text start="830.079" dur="7.711">she&amp;#39;s really saying is that she is okay</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="7.11">with effectively suspending the</text>
  <text start="837.79" dur="6.69">Constitution and setting up a military</text>
  <text start="840.67" dur="6.24">dictatorship to</text>
  <text start="844.48" dur="6.2">stop the inauguration of the next</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="6.81">president and the next vice-president</text>
  <text start="850.68" dur="5.74">going by the propaganda from the</text>
  <text start="853.72" dur="4.109">corporate media now this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="856.42" dur="4.979">ridiculous but we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.829" dur="5.461">out there and they are protesting and it</text>
  <text start="861.399" dur="4.791">started yesterday january fourteenth and</text>
  <text start="863.29" dur="5.849">this is going to lead up to the</text>
  <text start="866.19" dur="5.949">inauguration on the 20th and they want</text>
  <text start="869.139" dur="5.401">this to build over time now again there</text>
  <text start="872.139" dur="4.831">could be agent provocateurs within the</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="4.89">crowds we might see that some of these</text>
  <text start="876.97" dur="5.91">try to do things where they start to</text>
  <text start="879.43" dur="5.459">throw objects they try to block streets</text>
  <text start="882.88" dur="5.81">they will do all these different things</text>
  <text start="884.889" dur="6.151">to try to rile the crowd up and get them</text>
  <text start="888.69" dur="3.91">joining in with what they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="891.04" dur="3.78">does this mean they&amp;#39;re going to do this</text>
  <text start="892.6" dur="4.229">we don&amp;#39;t know yet but they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="894.82" dur="5.16">do whatever they possibly can and across</text>
  <text start="896.829" dur="6.69">the entire country they want this to</text>
  <text start="899.98" dur="5.51">spread now just days before the</text>
  <text start="903.519" dur="5.911">inauguration the washington DC police</text>
  <text start="905.49" dur="8.589">they found a cache of weapons in the</text>
  <text start="909.43" dur="8.399">capital just days before Trump is going</text>
  <text start="914.079" dur="8.671">to be inaugurated now there was a violin</text>
  <text start="917.829" dur="6.961">case which contained two guns and the</text>
  <text start="922.75" dur="4.319">police started to look further into this</text>
  <text start="924.79" dur="6.84">and they uncovered more guns and</text>
  <text start="927.069" dur="7.58">ammunition nearby now the discovery of</text>
  <text start="931.63" dur="5.579">these weapons comes just days after</text>
  <text start="934.649" dur="5.05">Russian intelligence officials warned of</text>
  <text start="937.209" dur="6.481">a plot by the US deep state to</text>
  <text start="939.699" dur="6.811">assassinate the president elect and the</text>
  <text start="943.69" dur="4.589">u.s. Park Police in DC they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="946.51" dur="3.629">investigating the two areas where the</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="6">weapons are found and they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="950.139" dur="8.01">another area now there&amp;#39;s no indication</text>
  <text start="954.279" dur="6.721">as to why these weapons were here when</text>
  <text start="958.149" dur="7.05">they came to be who brought them in and</text>
  <text start="961" dur="7.199">who they belong to but there was a woman</text>
  <text start="965.199" dur="4.801">who spotted the strange case and said I</text>
  <text start="968.199" dur="6.401">don&amp;#39;t know what this is why is this here</text>
  <text start="970" dur="7.329">and reported it to the police which</text>
  <text start="974.6" dur="5.039">is this part of their plan does she</text>
  <text start="977.329" dur="5.101">uncover something where it was planted</text>
  <text start="979.639" dur="4.591">in a certain area way before the</text>
  <text start="982.43" dur="3.149">inauguration said this way when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="984.23" dur="4.08">coming in you don&amp;#39;t have to bring the</text>
  <text start="985.579" dur="5.37">weapons in there already in the location</text>
  <text start="988.31" dur="6.269">to allow these individuals to get what</text>
  <text start="990.949" dur="5.851">they need to set up the entire false</text>
  <text start="994.579" dur="5.161">flag I mean think about what just</text>
  <text start="996.8" dur="5.58">happened here and we see that Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="999.74" dur="5.519">many others there are very worried about</text>
  <text start="1002.38" dur="4.53">Trump being assassinated and we know</text>
  <text start="1005.259" dur="3.181">that this is a very big deal we know the</text>
  <text start="1006.91" dur="4.409">establishment does not like Trump</text>
  <text start="1008.44" dur="5.94">whatsoever the CIA chief is out there</text>
  <text start="1011.319" dur="6.2">John Brennan and he is warned Donald</text>
  <text start="1014.38" dur="6.379">Trump to choose his words wisely</text>
  <text start="1017.519" dur="6.13">blasting the US president for lightning</text>
  <text start="1020.759" dur="5.261">the intelligence community to Nazi</text>
  <text start="1023.649" dur="4.111">Germany and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1026.02" dur="6.149">intelligence community does not like</text>
  <text start="1027.76" dur="6.179">Trump calling them out on all the stuff</text>
  <text start="1032.169" dur="4.321">that they&amp;#39;re doing because it brings</text>
  <text start="1033.939" dur="4.62">through brings attention to them where</text>
  <text start="1036.49" dur="3.599">people are looking at it saying well is</text>
  <text start="1038.559" dur="3.75">this stuff really true do they really</text>
  <text start="1040.089" dur="5.311">have evidence are they making this stuff</text>
  <text start="1042.309" dur="4.89">up why don&amp;#39;t they release the report now</text>
  <text start="1045.4" dur="4.71">there are some reports where Trump is</text>
  <text start="1047.199" dur="6.631">kind of taking a step back and say yes</text>
  <text start="1050.11" dur="6.179">Russia is hacking now what this means is</text>
  <text start="1053.83" dur="5.43">does the CIA have something on him and</text>
  <text start="1056.289" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re pressuring him are they</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="4.77">blackmailing him and we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="1061.99" dur="5.85">is going to be reducing these reports</text>
  <text start="1064.03" dur="6.18">not 90 days after he takes office so the</text>
  <text start="1067.84" dur="6.48">question is what is going on here at</text>
  <text start="1070.21" dur="7.89">this point and we do have to understand</text>
  <text start="1074.32" dur="6.87">that the deep state they will try to</text>
  <text start="1078.1" dur="6.15">control him just like they do with every</text>
  <text start="1081.19" dur="6.83">president if they do not go along with</text>
  <text start="1084.25" dur="7.289">what they want they will remove that</text>
  <text start="1088.02" dur="6.909">person they really don&amp;#39;t need that</text>
  <text start="1091.539" dur="5.491">person because they know they have the</text>
  <text start="1094.929" dur="3.301">vice president if the vice president</text>
  <text start="1097.03" dur="4.769">doesn&amp;#39;t do what they want they have the</text>
  <text start="1098.23" dur="7.16">next person in line and you can see</text>
  <text start="1101.799" dur="6.211">right now that they will use blackmail</text>
  <text start="1105.39" dur="3.16">they will do whatever they possibly have</text>
  <text start="1108.01" dur="4.49">to</text>
  <text start="1108.55" dur="5.91">due to keep control of the situation</text>
