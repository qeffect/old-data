  <text start="90.409" dur="4.051">like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow you can see</text>
  <text start="91.819" dur="5.791">certain individuals out there that are</text>

  <text start="97.61" dur="6.539">about the spying commenting on Assange</text>
  <text start="101.079" dur="5.411">commenting on everything and you can see</text>

  <text start="106.49" dur="6.239">loudest they have the most to lose if we</text>
  <text start="110.18" dur="4.67">look at Hillary Clinton and we look at</text>
  <text start="112.729" dur="5.371">what she&amp;#39;s been saying about Assange</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="6.689">she says he must now answer for what he</text>
  <text start="118.1" dur="8.879">has done what did he do well he</text>
  <text start="121.539" dur="7.75">downloaded her email and exposed her she</text>
  <text start="126.979" dur="4.171">said the following I think it is clear</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="3.691">from the indictment that came out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="4.02">not about punishing journalism</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="3.569">it is about assisting the hacking of a</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="3.39">military computer to steal information</text>
  <text start="136.549" dur="4.47">from the United States government and</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="4.799">look I&amp;#39;ll wait and see what happens with</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="4.921">the charges and how it proceeds but he</text>
  <text start="143.359" dur="4.651">skipped bail in the UK the bottom line</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="5.549">is he has to answer for what he has done</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="7.44">at least as it&amp;#39;s been charged the former</text>
  <text start="151.489" dur="5.751">secretary said to an audience now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.45" dur="5.54">very interesting is</text>
  <text start="157.24" dur="6.6">these charges have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="160.99" dur="5.37">2016 have nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="5.01">election have nothing to do with Russia</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="7.08">it actually has nothing to do with any</text>
  <text start="168.85" dur="7.44">of this so assuming that Assange is</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="4.98">successfully extradited Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.16">will stand trial in a courtroom in</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="3.96">Alexandria Virginia where prosecutors</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="4.48">from the Eastern District of Virginia</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="5.58">will try to prove that he broke US law</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="4.86">by goading Chelsea Manning into turning</text>
  <text start="187.96" dur="6.12">over hundreds of thousands of classified</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="6.66">documents remember there is only one</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="6.24">charge that has been levied against</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="6.6">Assange conspiracy to hack a government</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="6.39">computer and if he is convicted it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="5.81">five and a half years in prison now when</text>
  <text start="206.71" dur="4.53">we look at the Assange indictment</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="3.64">prosecutors claim that after Manning had</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="2.85">already handed over hundreds of</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="2.61">thousands of documents to Wikileaks a</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="2.79">Saund</text>
  <text start="215.11" dur="3.36">tried to help the former Army private</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="3.54">and intelligence Islands crack a</text>
  <text start="218.47" dur="3.84">password that would have allowed her to</text>
  <text start="220.42" dur="4.83">access hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="5.13">documents however Assange never</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="4.59">succeeded in cracking the password at</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="5.61">least not from what the prosecutors are</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="5.88">aware of what he did allegedly do was</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="4.17">conspire with Manning to transmit the</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.25">documents she had had succeeded in</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="4.86">stealing while and this is key</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="5.01">encouraging Manning to turn over more</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="7.41">documents when she expressed reluctance</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="6.94">so to support all of this and to support</text>
  <text start="249.49" dur="6.54">the case the government has obtained</text>
  <text start="251.92" dur="7.8">chat logs from March 2010 showing</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="7.44">Manning communicating with a mysterious</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="9.96">individual who or alternately went by</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="7.92">the handle o X and pre Association so</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="4.5">the government believes this user was</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="5.01">Assange after true transmitting the</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="4.55">hundreds of thousands of war logs from</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="4.47">Iraq and Afghanistan and detainee</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="4.51">assessment briefs from Guantanamo Bay</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="5.94">Manning said her stash of secret</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="6.1">documents had run dry after this upload</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="5.68">that&amp;#39;s all I really have</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="5.88">left to which her co-conspirator replied</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="5.91">curious eyes never run dry in my</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="5.58">experience so the indictment also</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="5.13">references a claim made by Manning to</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="4.35">her during her court-martial that she</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="4.32">had discussed the value of the quote</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="5.25">anima detainee assessments with the</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="5.46">person alleged to be a son so at this</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="4.71">point they don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s Assange it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.31" dur="4.65">a mysterious individual and they believe</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s Assange now that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="4.62">so as for how they&amp;#39;re in they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="3.45">to conclusively prove that Assange was</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.77">the individual who corresponded with</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="5.25">Manning on the jabber chat service they</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="5.97">were using well that hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="7.46">revealed as of yet and we can see why</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="6.36">they might have used this charge because</text>
  <text start="336.79" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s going to take a lot to prove that</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="7.59">it&amp;#39;s Assange because it&amp;#39;s not his voice</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="7.39">it&amp;#39;s someone typing into the chat system</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="4.19">and this is going to be very very</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="3.42">difficult</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="3.88">now the indictment that the Justice</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="3.44">Department filed against Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="4.17">in the Eastern District of Virginia</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="4.72">charges him with conspiracy to commit</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.55">computer fraud like we said the</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="4.8">conspiracy statute is section 371 of the</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="4.41">Penal Code and the Computer Fraud</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="5.99">offenses that were the objectives of the</text>
  <text start="369.47" dur="6.54">conspiracy are parts of section 1030 now</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="7.75">according to the indictment Assange and</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="7.26">Manning conspired in 2010 Manning was</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="4.05">prosecuted by the own forces the Justice</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="4.32">Department&amp;#39;s indictment against Assange</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="6.54">was not returned until 2018 eight years</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="6.06">later now the five-year statute of</text>
  <text start="391.22" dur="5.34">limitations that applies to most federal</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="6.15">crimes is prescribed for both conspiracy</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="5.13">and Computer Fraud so how is the Justice</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="4.05">Department able to prosecute Assange on</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="3.78">in the diamond filed three years after</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="5.01">the proscribed</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="5.91">limitations period well it appears that</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="6.87">the Justice Department is relying on an</text>
  <text start="411.38" dur="6.09">exception in Section 23 32 B of the</text>
  <text start="415.73" dur="4.83">penal code that extends the statute of</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="4.659">limitations to eight years for acts of</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.509">terrorism</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="5.22">and sending national boundaries now</text>
  <text start="425.069" dur="5.25">conspiracy to commit computer fraud is a</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="5.58">very serious offense and ahsan jizz is</text>
  <text start="430.319" dur="4.44">at the top of the seriousness range</text>
  <text start="432.929" dur="5.09">because it involves publication of</text>
  <text start="434.759" dur="5.851">defense secrets that endangered lives</text>
  <text start="438.019" dur="4.51">including the lives of our troops and</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s no debt that the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="442.529" dur="5.07">transcended national boundaries Assange</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="5.099">was outside the US when he collaborated</text>
  <text start="447.599" dur="3.39">with Manning but is it really an act of</text>
  <text start="450.149" dur="5.88">terrorism</text>
  <text start="450.989" dur="7.17">and was it him now this is going to be</text>
  <text start="456.029" dur="5.31">tough because they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="458.159" dur="5.49">really prove all of this because the</text>
  <text start="461.339" dur="5.37">original statute of limitations ran out</text>
  <text start="463.649" dur="4.74">and they&amp;#39;re trying to get him on this so</text>
  <text start="466.709" dur="4.621">when you start to put all this together</text>
  <text start="468.389" dur="7.05">it seems like this was put together to</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="9.649">maybe fail in the end let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="475.439" dur="7.77">post 874 and Q this is March 7 2018</text>
  <text start="480.979" dur="6.67">right around when the indictment came</text>
  <text start="483.209" dur="9.091">out and it says Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="487.649" dur="7.68">have you learned to and eliminate el61</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.009">is l6 many people say it&amp;#39;s maybe a chess</text>
  <text start="495.329" dur="4.44">move other people say it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="497.309" dur="6.991">else we don&amp;#39;t exactly know and it says</text>
  <text start="499.769" dur="8.04">use logic q then if we move to post 1708</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="5.759">it says Julian Assange why does the UK</text>
  <text start="507.809" dur="6.45">government desperately want Julian</text>
  <text start="510.059" dur="8.85">Assange think source files the more you</text>
  <text start="514.259" dur="7.47">know so they know that he has the source</text>
  <text start="518.909" dur="6.091">or maybe not</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="7.651">because Q has been saying we have the</text>
  <text start="525" dur="7.319">source that&amp;#39;s interesting so is Q saying</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="7.53">they have the source files and soon to</text>
  <text start="532.319" dur="8.58">have Julian Assange to help with the</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="7.619">entire case that has to do with Clinton</text>
  <text start="540.899" dur="5.58">and many others maybe</text>
  <text start="544.529" dur="4.95">now something very interesting Matt</text>
  <text start="546.479" dur="6.57">Gaetz introduced a bill dubbed the</text>
  <text start="549.479" dur="7.2">pencil act and he called it the pencil</text>
  <text start="553.049" dur="6.29">act because Trump well he kept calling</text>
  <text start="556.679" dur="6.9">Schiff pencil neck</text>
  <text start="559.339" dur="6.22">now this pencil act is to remove Adam</text>
  <text start="563.579" dur="3.84">Schiff from the House Intel committee</text>

  <text start="586.259" dur="4.11">sense of the house representatives that</text>
