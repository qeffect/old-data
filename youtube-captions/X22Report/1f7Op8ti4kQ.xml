  <text start="28.71" dur="6.24">episode 633 and today&amp;#39;s date is april</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="5.43">third 2015 and the title this episode is</text>
  <text start="34.95" dur="6.3">the US government recovery looks like an</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="5.37">economic collapse let&amp;#39;s get right into</text>
  <text start="41.25" dur="3.03">the economic collapse news now we</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="3.45">understand there are still talks going</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="4.049">on with Greece and the ECB we understand</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="4.169">there&amp;#39;s a payment coming due on april</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="3.21">9th and of a lot of corporate media is</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="2.221">out there saying that Greece is not</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="3.691">going to be able to make this payment</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="4.05">and we&amp;#39;ve been watching grease very</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="3.84">carefully and we see they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.59">maneuvering towards Russia they also</text>
  <text start="59.07" dur="5.01">have a plan B just in case they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="5.399">have the funds to cover the payment and</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="6.27">this might mean a default of the entire</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="5.011">system their plan B basically is getting</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="3.78">rid of the Euro going back to the</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="5.519">drachma and nationalizing all their</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="5.22">banks and we can see right now that if</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="4.951">this does occur this might set off a</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="4.23">chain reaction of derivatives right now</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="3.869">there are trillions and trillions of</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="4.56">dollars worth of derivatives and if</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="4.561">Greece defaults this might start a chain</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="4.08">reaction this could be the start of the</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="4.049">economic collapse now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="4.649">it&amp;#39;s going to happen I&amp;#39;m saying that we</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="5.82">need to watch this and see how this</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="6.231">turns out we see the finance minister in</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="5.701">Greece is saying up there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="103.1" dur="5.65">nothing to worry about here we do have</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="4.979">the money to pay for our april 9th</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="3.96">deadline and everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="4.14">okay and i think what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.799">is they&amp;#39;re stalling they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.22">maneuver away from the eurozone they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.07">trying to exit and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="5.311">figure out a way to do this in the best</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="5.371">case scenario and I think the eurozone</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="5.1">is also doing this because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.649">want to trigger the derivatives and this</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="2.49">could send shockwaves throughout the</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="2.671">financial</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="6.3">and actually start the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="135.27" dur="7.44">and we see right now that this is</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="5.79">ongoing the april ninth date is coming</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="6.33">up and again greece has been talking to</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="6.87">russia russia most likely will will</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.85">remove the food ban for Greece Russia</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="4.35">most likely will step in help them out</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="2.94">financially we understand there&amp;#39;s a gas</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="2.79">pipeline that&amp;#39;s going to go right</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="5.01">through Greece they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="8.1">spur economic growth and again even if</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="7.8">they leave the euro in a good way let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="5.01">say it will spread throughout the</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="4.32">eurozone other countries will look at</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="5.34">this months will go by they&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="174.96" dur="4.95">Greece is improving the economy is</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.81">returning and other countries are going</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.96">to say you know something there is no</text>
  <text start="181.74" dur="4.35">reason for us to be in the eurozone why</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="7.53">are we doing this it is time for us to</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="8.91">leave and this also might start a chain</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.85">reaction of a collapse scenario and when</text>
  <text start="195" dur="5.94">we look around the entire private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="7.29">central bank system we do see that this</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="7.47">whole entire system is basically being</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="6.9">held together with tape and one small</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="5.57">little incident completely devastates</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="5.61">the system and it comes crumbling down</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="5.5">because we have to remember all the</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="4.5">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="219.48" dur="4.71">all they&amp;#39;re doing is throwing more junk</text>
  <text start="221.55" dur="4.71">into the system trying to bring more and</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="5.31">more people into the system to keep</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="5.43">these bubbles pumped up just like back</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="5.79">in 2007-2008 there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.34">difference except this time it is much</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="4.71">much worse we really never really got</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="5.4">out of the crash of 2008 all they did</text>
  <text start="240" dur="5.22">was covered up with illusionary numbers</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.91">pumping up all the different bubbles the</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="6.03">derivatives the stock market the real</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.19">estate the auto industry they made it</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="3.87">belated all these statistical numbers to</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="3.179">make us believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.17">but you have to remember all those</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="3.961">people lost their credit people lost</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="3.51">their homes people lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="260.67" dur="5.73">people lost their retirement their life</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="4.3">savings and this time it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="2.92">much</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="6.69">much worse now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="7.47">we they came out with the job report the</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="5.84">BLS reported that in March a hundred and</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="7.05">twenty-six thousand jobs were added</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="7.12">that&amp;#39;s pretty bad nearly fifty percent</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.34">below the 245,000 expected and the</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="5.67">lowest monthly increase since march of</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="4.89">2013 and the unemployment rate of course</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="3.87">is unchanged from five point five</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="4.83">percent because they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="6.06">illusion alive here most importantly</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="8.7">this ends any speculation about a rate</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="8.94">hike in mid-2015 the Fed is no way going</text>
  <text start="307.6" dur="5.94">to raise the interest rates if they do</text>
  <text start="311.29" dur="5.96">just like they did back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="313.54" dur="6.87">seven going into 2008 it would devastate</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="7.62">the stock market it would devastate the</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="10.22">real estate market it would have a</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="8.79">completely gigantic impact on the entire</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="7.44">economy this is why they haven&amp;#39;t done it</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="7.66">all those people that were going to the</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.44">to the Fed the short-term window</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="4.95">borrowing the money at zero percent</text>
  <text start="343.51" dur="4.5">investing into the stock market getting</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="6.78">the return returning it with no interest</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="7.11">that will end all the automobile</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="5.58">industry everyone with the subprime</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="5.55">credit you have a heartbeat you can get</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="5.31">a loan because the interest rates are so</text>
  <text start="360.67" dur="5.4">low that will end the real estate market</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="4.04">as soon as we see the interest rate</text>
  <text start="366.07" dur="4.74">stick up just a little bit mortgage</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="6.31">applications take a complete dive if</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="7.56">they go up by one or two percent it will</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="6.54">be a disaster and they know this and</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="5.76">this is why they&amp;#39;re not going to raise</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="7.41">the interest rates and if they do it</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="6.36">will be a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="4.53">everyone&amp;#39;s looking at this job report</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="5.52">saying I was the weather that is the</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="5.58">problem well guess what it isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="396.01" dur="4.62">weather the downward trend is continuing</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="3.93">it is not the</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="4.2">whether whatsoever actually during the</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="7.41">worst part of the weather jobs were much</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="10.73">higher than they are in March and we can</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="7.95">see that this system is completely</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="8.62">collapsing I mean think about this</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="12.59">there&amp;#39;s 93.1 75 million people out of</text>
  <text start="424.18" dur="12.93">the labor force what is this telling us</text>
  <text start="430.23" dur="10.65">people cannot find work the people who</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="9.95">dropped out of the labor force rose by</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="8.32">277,000 up 2.1 million in the past year</text>
  <text start="447.06" dur="4.42">indicative Lee this means that the labor</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="6.71">force partition rate dropped once more</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="8.42">from 62 point eight percent to 62.7 a</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="7.96">level that was seen back in February of</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="6.1">1978 and remember 1978 for those who can</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="5.69">remember that it was awful people</text>
  <text start="466" dur="6.51">couldn&amp;#39;t find work during the 70&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="7.39">this is exactly what&amp;#39;s going on right</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="6.12">now of course it&amp;#39;s much easier to keep</text>
  <text start="476.95" dur="3.42">everyone in the dark of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="4.17">going on with these illusionary numbers</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="5.07">but we know better we really know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.37">going on here the BLS reported that the</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="4.65">entire labor force actually declined for</text>
  <text start="488.17" dur="4.68">the second consecutive month down almost</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="7.74">a hundred thousand in March to a hundred</text>
  <text start="492.85" dur="7.11">and fifty 6906 and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="497.83" dur="3.99">convince us that oh okay March took a</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="4.95">little bit of a hit it was because of</text>
  <text start="501.82" dur="6.51">the weather and don&amp;#39;t worry this is how</text>
  <text start="504.91" dur="5.82">a recovery looks really so you&amp;#39;re what</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re saying as a recovery looks like</text>
  <text start="510.73" dur="5.67">a collapse I mean really think about it</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="6.359">and they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that yes</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="6.92">we added 126,000 jobs where where are</text>
  <text start="519.789" dur="6.751">these jobs added they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="9.85">26,000 of these jobs were added to the</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="8.18">retail sector really so let&amp;#39;s say stores</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="4.86">are closing down</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="7.03">people are being laid off from the</text>
  <text start="538.03" dur="8.49">retail stores and they added 26,000 more</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="6.51">people in the month of March does this</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="3.48">make any sense let&amp;#39;s take a look at this</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="3.39">for a second so they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="550" dur="5.1">retail is doing well because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="8.21">adding more jobs and during this year we</text>

  <text start="627.64" dur="7.56">these jobs in retail it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="7.11">and we know most of these jobs have been</text>
  <text start="635.2" dur="6.09">going to the food industry those people</text>
  <text start="638.23" dur="8.13">who are waiters bartenders but guess</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="7.35">what that trend is declining also the</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="6.69">bartender hiring spree the waitress</text>

  <text start="653.05" dur="6.3">now right now it is declined and it is</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="6.39">saw it&amp;#39;s worse monthly increase since</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="8.46">June of 2012 it&amp;#39;s already on a downward</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="6.51">trend because why</text>
  <text start="667.81" dur="6.99">how many more people can we fit into</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="6.96">this industry at a certain point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="5.34">just no more jobs nobody can get a job</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="7.8">in this room because it&amp;#39;s full and then</text>
  <text start="680.14" dur="8.01">we look at the youth of America and the</text>
  <text start="684.82" dur="5.73">older population the only jobs being</text>
  <text start="688.15" dur="6.15">created are those for aged workers</text>
  <text start="690.55" dur="6.66">Americans 55 and over the reason is</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="6.42">twofold with savings rates at zero guess</text>
  <text start="697.21" dur="8.01">what they&amp;#39;re getting no return on their</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="7.65">retirement so what do they do they have</text>
  <text start="705.22" dur="6.24">to go out and get a part-time job to</text>
  <text start="708.37" dur="6.12">make ends meet plus with food inflation</text>
  <text start="711.46" dur="5.58">because most of the retirees they just</text>
  <text start="714.49" dur="6.66">continually buy food as prices and food</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="7.26">go up guess what happens there amount of</text>
  <text start="721.15" dur="5.4">income and disposable income goes down</text>
  <text start="724.3" dur="4.89">so they&amp;#39;re getting zero percent interest</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="4.53">they have inflation they need to get</text>
  <text start="729.19" dur="3.899">that second job and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.08" dur="5.19">happening right now and also we have zip</text>
  <text start="733.089" dur="5.791">and nerve and basically this all leads</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="4.23">into it and they can&amp;#39;t make it and this</text>

  <text start="1290.06" dur="6.53">because of the sanctions and once the UN</text>

  <text start="1315.5" dur="6.03">didn&amp;#39;t move in and invest in Iran is</text>
  <text start="1318.92" dur="4.89">because of the UN sanctions if the UN</text>
