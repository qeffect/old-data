  <text start="246.74" dur="7.53">it&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s happening live right</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="8.04">in front of our faces now out in the UK</text>

  <text start="257.7" dur="5.45">not appear to have been strengthened</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="7.141">after she survived the no confidence</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="5.47">vote and it looks like she&amp;#39;s in trouble</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="4.77">she&amp;#39;s already said that she&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="5.76">to be running in the next election the</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="7.17">people once again they really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="6.36">this deal the EU individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="297.3" dur="6.45">we see our own chaos and remember the</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="5.99">chaos here is a little different we see</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="5.03">a movement we see a movement of people</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="6.16">saying you know something we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="6.04">going to work with the central bank</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="5.52">anymore we don&amp;#39;t want the central bank</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="6.48">anymore we don&amp;#39;t want these people in</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="6.77">government anymore but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="6.69">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="7.15">prior to Trump coming into office the</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="6.63">deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s they have</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="5.52">been planning for when the system comes</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="4.23">down and who was going to be responsible</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="4.14">and who was going to hold all the debt</text>
  <text start="338.85" dur="3.87">and how they&amp;#39;re going to bring the</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="4.16">United States down to a third world</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="5.07">nation by moving world manufacturing</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="4.96">businesses out of the country bringing</text>
  <text start="347.79" dur="6.69">any legals and things like that now</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="6.6">during this period of planning they did</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="5.55">many different things and it wasn&amp;#39;t by</text>
  <text start="357" dur="4.98">accident I mean when Goldman Sachs and</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="4.44">the rest of the bank&amp;#39;s became banks</text>
  <text start="361.98" dur="6.54">where they were able to access the Fed</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="6.54">window count deposits as depositors and</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="3.77">take on more depositors this was all</text>
  <text start="371.01" dur="3.44">part of their plan</text>
  <text start="372.29" dur="6.28">think about what these banks were doing</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="6.55">they knew bailouts weren&amp;#39;t going to work</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="6.24">anymore and they knew they were going to</text>
  <text start="381" dur="7.68">create bail-ins so goldman sachs and the</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="5.88">rest of these banks became banks where</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="4.46">they can take on deposits why would they</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="5.31">do this unless they knew something</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="5.74">unless they planned for something they</text>
  <text start="396" dur="6.21">knew that eventually the banks would</text>
  <text start="398.88" dur="6.99">shut down the banks would go on a bank</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="7.62">holiday I mean didn&amp;#39;t the banks go on a</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="7.02">bank holiday on December 5th was that a</text>
  <text start="409.83" dur="6.51">coincidence think about it for a second</text>
  <text start="412.89" dur="6.72">what happened the day before the market</text>
  <text start="416.34" dur="5.88">came down dramatically and then</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="6.63">everything was closed very interesting</text>
  <text start="422.22" dur="6.02">but what they were planning is something</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.88">even worse than that</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="6.55">they were planning to make sure the</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="6.98">American people were holding all the</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="6.629">Treasuries think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="4.96">foreign buyers were gonna dump</text>
  <text start="441.419" dur="3.961">Treasuries what do you do with him the</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="4.53">Fed could purchase them but they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="7.43">want them so what did they do during the</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="9.079">periods of 2008 up to the present they</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="8.91">made pension funds investments and</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="10.091">everything else purchase Treasuries</text>
  <text start="461.72" dur="11.59">today US households owned more</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="8.34">Treasuries than foreigners this is very</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="4.02">disturbing what happens when we go</text>
  <text start="476.1" dur="4.319">through a transition and the whole</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="6.74">system comes apart who&amp;#39;s holding all the</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="7.081">debt who might not get paid on the debt</text>
  <text start="484.07" dur="9.37">the American people this was their plan</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="9.36">but hopefully with Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="8.64">taking over the central bank this might</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="9.69">be turned around because if you look at</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="6.75">post 25 75 and we we read this before it</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="6.06">talks about a structure change coming</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="6.3">now during the question and answer and I</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="8.369">pulled this cue post from there this is</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="14.36">post 2619 in Annan asked you do we have</text>

  <text start="578.54" dur="3.63">just don&amp;#39;t want people to catch on to</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="2.75">what gold really is and that&amp;#39;s real</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="3.899">money</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="4.45">same thing with silver they don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="587.36" dur="5.669">want people to learn that this is real</text>
  <text start="591.29" dur="5.76">money the paper stuff that we&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="593.029" dur="7.29">you that&amp;#39;s not money that&amp;#39;s dead so</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="6.029">right here with Trump having Andrew</text>
  <text start="600.319" dur="5.431">Jackson hanging on the wall that is a</text>
  <text start="603.079" dur="7.021">signal letting us know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="6.389">after the central bank if you notice Q</text>
  <text start="610.1" dur="4.679">now is posting a little bit more about</text>
  <text start="612.139" dur="5.401">the central bank about the Fed and what</text>
  <text start="614.779" dur="5.37">their plans are and I believe going</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="5.46">forward we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more posts</text>
  <text start="620.149" dur="5.971">like this where Q is going to be talking</text>
  <text start="623" dur="4.74">about the central bank and what plans</text>
  <text start="626.12" dur="3.57">they have and of course you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="3.87">to put up that all out there now because</text>
  <text start="629.69" dur="3.629">if they tell us all about their plans</text>
  <text start="631.61" dur="3.839">well then the central bank can react and</text>
  <text start="633.319" dur="4.651">they can try to do something else</text>
  <text start="635.449" dur="4.471">remember just because Powell is in this</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="4.47">position doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s in full</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="4.77">control of the central bank you still</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="4.32">have the Rothschilds they have the</text>
  <text start="644.69" dur="5.85">ultimate control over the central</text>
  <text start="646.76" dur="7.259">banking system and believe me they have</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="5.489">control and this plan it&amp;#39;s not just to</text>
  <text start="654.019" dur="3.361">get rid of the Fed because then you</text>
  <text start="656.029" dur="3.24">still have the ECB you still have the</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="3.329">IMF you still have the biz you still</text>
  <text start="659.269" dur="3.661">have the other central banks because</text>
  <text start="660.709" dur="4.891">remember Q listed all the central banks</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="5.159">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of them that are</text>
  <text start="665.6" dur="7.169">controlled by the Rothschilds so this</text>
  <text start="668.089" dur="8.281">plan is much much larger than just the</text>
  <text start="672.769" dur="5.76">Fed that is the beaming stages but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="676.37" dur="4.139">much larger than that and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="678.529" dur="4.951">believe that Q can tell us everything at</text>
  <text start="680.509" dur="5.19">this point because again because of</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="4.38">certain reasons of letting them know</text>
  <text start="685.699" dur="4.08">what they&amp;#39;re planning on doing they</text>
  <text start="687.86" dur="3.31">don&amp;#39;t want to let the cat out of the bag</text>
  <text start="689.779" dur="3.131">so</text>
  <text start="691.17" dur="4.8">q is gonna be dropping some breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="5.16">but what I get from all of this is that</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="5.51">they&amp;#39;ve had this plan for a very long</text>
  <text start="698.07" dur="7.05">time they made sure that they had gold</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="7.479">because if the United States has this</text>
  <text start="705.12" dur="7.8">gold and we&amp;#39;ve restored the system using</text>
  <text start="708.959" dur="6.961">gold maybe as a confidence builder maybe</text>
  <text start="712.92" dur="6.599">to back the currency guess what happens</text>
  <text start="715.92" dur="7.47">to the Fed because if the United States</text>
