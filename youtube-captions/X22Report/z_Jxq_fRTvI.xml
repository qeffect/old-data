  <text start="144.24" dur="5.16">they said credit card usage which was up</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.1">well a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t have savings</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="4.169">so they had a resort to credit cards so</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="2.94">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is stores</text>
  <text start="153.569" dur="3.211">are coming out and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>

  <text start="160.2" dur="3.15">off people and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="3.96">this from other stores which we</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="5.609">mentioned before now if we take a look</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.25">at the household debt we know that</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="4.831">household debt has hit all-time highs</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="5.76">and it looks like it&amp;#39;s continually</text>

  <text start="222.209" dur="7.081">high of around 87 percent in 2009 after</text>
  <text start="227.099" dur="5.67">years of deleveraging in the wake of the</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="6">2007 2009 recession household debt has</text>
  <text start="232.769" dur="4.491">risen more than eighteen percent since</text>

  <text start="237.26" dur="5.289">auto loans grew by eight billion credit</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="5.28">cards group buys 26 billion student</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.17">loans grew by 21 billion and we could</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="3.869">see right now there are a lot of red</text>
  <text start="246.719" dur="5.55">flags out there showing that there are</text>
  <text start="249.269" dur="4.92">problems actually Wells Fargo is saying</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="5.37">that the housing recovery is stalling</text>
  <text start="254.189" dur="6.241">mortgage origination --zz we&amp;#39;re at 452</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="4.951">billion down from 479 billion in the</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="4.769">third quarter and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="4.859">everything slip and slide here now if we</text>
  <text start="265.199" dur="5.791">look at the personal savings rate we can</text>
  <text start="267.449" dur="8.22">see that in January it plunged to a near</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="10.799">all-time low and here we are it&amp;#39;s below</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="9.571">where we were back in 2008-2009 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.789" dur="6.69">just getting worse right now which tells</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="5.1">us we have major problems ahead that</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="4.051">people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="4.139">saving money they&amp;#39;re resorting to credit</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="4.8">cards they&amp;#39;re putting themselves further</text>
  <text start="294.479" dur="4.021">and further into debt this is not going</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="5.79">to end well now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="7.409">is that intelligence director Coates was</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="5.37">out there and he was in front of</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="6.69">Congress and he was talking about the</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="8.25">national debt and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="312.599" dur="5.581">debt right now is unsustainable and he</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="3.57">said the failure to address our</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="3.9">long-term fiscal situation has in</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="4.02">crease the national debt to over 20</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="4.47">trillion and growing this situation is</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="4.14">unsustainable as I think we all know and</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="5.55">represents a dire threat to our economic</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="6.42">national security now of course the debt</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="5.46">is unsustainable it always has been and</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="5.37">as it keeps growing it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="6.2">worse and worse and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="7.29">here is they&amp;#39;re building all of this up</text>
  <text start="343.76" dur="6.64">for the takedown they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.34">idea that everything that you see</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="5.34">happening right now cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="5.55">and especially with what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="4.98">now we see a lot of corporate media</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="4.29">outlets out there saying that this is</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.92">the Trump economy since the stock market</text>
  <text start="362.73" dur="4.44">came down Trump owns the economy you</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="3.9">know it&amp;#39;s his economy and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="367.17" dur="4.5">on and on about how this is all his</text>
  <text start="369.54" dur="6.06">economy and he&amp;#39;s going to be putting the</text>
  <text start="371.67" dur="5.9">country into further debt yes he will be</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="4.83">putting the country into further debt</text>
  <text start="377.57" dur="6.37">just like every single other president</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="6.6">while Obama really you know open the</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="4.8">spigots and went crazy with the debt the</text>
  <text start="387.03" dur="3.75">reason why we&amp;#39;re gonna be going further</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="4.74">and further into debt at this point is</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="6.09">because we are now transitioning into</text>
  <text start="393.48" dur="6.23">something else and we might as well use</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="6.12">what we have and what they&amp;#39;ve done to</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="8.2">fund everything think about this for a</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="7.83">second take all this created currency</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="5.97">from the central bank use it to repair</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="6.72">the infrastructure set it up so we can</text>
  <text start="413.88" dur="7.5">have a transition set it up to basically</text>
  <text start="417.54" dur="6.83">fix our a whole entire computer</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="6.03">infrastructure our roads everything</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="6.31">rebuild everything prepare the country</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="5.31">for a brand new system and then all you</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="4.05">have to do is say we&amp;#39;re not paying for</text>
  <text start="432.72" dur="3.96">that debt this is what China is doing</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="4.05">right now they&amp;#39;re selling the Treasury</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="4.14">bonds and they&amp;#39;re building all of these</text>
  <text start="438.78" dur="4.77">cities because they realize what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="4.83">to happen as the economic power shifts</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s going to be all them they have them</text>
  <text start="445.65" dur="4.86">at think about what happened after World</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="7.02">War two the United States had all the</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="5.64">manufacturing Europe was a disaster</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="3.54">all the gold flowed to the United States</text>
  <text start="456.15" dur="4.05">United States said alright we&amp;#39;ll hold</text>
  <text start="457.65" dur="4.14">the gold the United States then became</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="3.81">the reserve currency of the world we had</text>
  <text start="461.79" dur="5.34">the manufacturing and we were on a gold</text>
  <text start="464.01" dur="6.6">standard at that point the same things</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="5.55">gonna happen here where China now is a</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="3.87">manufacturing powerhouse they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="3.48">starting the one belt one road system</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="3.39">where they can distribute all the</text>
  <text start="476.16" dur="3.69">products throughout Africa throughout</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="4.83">Europe throughout Asia and eventually</text>
  <text start="479.85" dur="4.83">here to North and South America the</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="4.32">United States hasn&amp;#39;t joined up as of yet</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="6.03">but eventually the United States will</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="8.94">and we can see right now we need to have</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="7.56">our infrastructure we need our computer</text>
  <text start="495.96" dur="4.29">infrastructure all built out because</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="3.36">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;re going to be on a different</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.27">currency system most likely an</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="5.4">electronic currency system most likely</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s going to be blockchain and we can</text>
  <text start="508.41" dur="4.83">see that we will need all of this</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="4.68">completed and this is why there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="513.24" dur="3.84">infrastructure bill this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="5.7">pushing this the system we&amp;#39;re in today</text>
  <text start="517.08" dur="6.57">is pretty much done with and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="4.14">talking about oh if he does this the</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="3.96">system won&amp;#39;t last over it</text>
  <text start="525.09" dur="6.66">yes the system will not last no matter</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="6.15">what if he did absolutely nothing the</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="4.65">system wouldn&amp;#39;t last why do you think on</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="6.69">the flip side they were trying to pass</text>
  <text start="536.4" dur="7.86">the TPP because they knew they needed to</text>
  <text start="540.45" dur="8.16">push the system out to the entire world</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="5.79">and bring in other individuals from</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="4.77">other countries to work here in the</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.67">United States at lower wages because</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="4.68">they were going to have a one-world type</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="6.05">of government where their court system</text>
  <text start="558.06" dur="6.06">sat above every single government</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="3.79">because they knew this system was not</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.33">going to last we were transitioning into</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="4.83">a new system no matter what it just</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="6.18">depends on where we&amp;#39;re going with it who</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="7.17">is going to control it if we were under</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="5.69">let&amp;#39;s say the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="4.05">banking system the way they wanted it</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="5.68">well we would have transitioned into</text>
  <text start="581.61" dur="5.91">some type of global currency they knew</text>
  <text start="585" dur="4.8">the system was going to last</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="3.569">and everything would be very different</text>
  <text start="589.8" dur="2.159">actually the country here the United</text>
  <text start="591.089" dur="3.361">States were probably a third-world</text>
  <text start="591.959" dur="3.57">country at that point because they</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="3">weren&amp;#39;t gonna bring all the other</text>
  <text start="595.529" dur="3.091">countries up to the level United States</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="3.69">they were going to bring the United</text>
  <text start="598.62" dur="4.98">States down to the level of the other</text>
  <text start="601.14" dur="4.98">countries and this way you can have</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="5.429">pretty much slave labor across the board</text>
  <text start="606.12" dur="4.29">and we can see right now we&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="609.029" dur="3.661">completely different track yes the</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="3.54">central bankers they still are going to</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="4.08">try to do this the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.95" dur="5.16">going to try to do this they never stop</text>
  <text start="616.77" dur="4.74">with their goal and they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="619.11" dur="3.84">on this for a very long time and you can</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="3.51">see they&amp;#39;re continually pushing this</text>
  <text start="622.95" dur="5.19">plan the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="5.069">around for a very long time and you can</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="5.069">see they pretty much have control of the</text>
  <text start="630.089" dur="5.551">world they create currency edit in there</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="6.121">they control countries right now and</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="7.38">what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of is a system</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="6.449">that they cannot control remember they</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="4.77">want control of the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="645.779" dur="5.341">because once you have the creation of</text>
  <text start="647.79" dur="6.359">currency and countries and the people of</text>
  <text start="651.12" dur="4.68">the country have to borrow from you you</text>
  <text start="654.149" dur="7.111">have complete and utter control of them</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="7.95">if a country does not need you does not</text>
  <text start="661.26" dur="4.38">need your currency which you create out</text>
  <text start="663.75" dur="4.86">of thin air and they can create their</text>
  <text start="665.64" dur="5.49">own well the central bankers have a</text>
  <text start="668.61" dur="5.039">problem with this because that means</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="3.99">that economy without an interest</text>
  <text start="673.649" dur="5.581">attached when they create their currency</text>
  <text start="675.12" dur="5.76">is going to thrive that&amp;#39;s why all those</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="4.53">countries that don&amp;#39;t have a private</text>
  <text start="680.88" dur="5.42">western central bank who are controlling</text>

  <text start="692.61" dur="5.849">the central banks don&amp;#39;t like people to</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="5.52">see this they actually demonize those</text>
  <text start="698.459" dur="6.061">type of countries they like to keep</text>
  <text start="701.01" dur="6.63">countries in debt but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="704.52" dur="6.48">them to fail if they fail then it</text>
  <text start="707.64" dur="5.91">reflects on them so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="713.55" dur="4.14">control of the currency where they can</text>
  <text start="715.5" dur="4.5">say listen you&amp;#39;re gonna have to take on</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="3.74">more debt but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to make</text>
  <text start="720" dur="3.11">the people suffer for it</text>
  <text start="721.43" dur="3.09">and this is what&amp;#39;s been happening in</text>
  <text start="723.11" dur="4.65">Greece this is what&amp;#39;s been happening in</text>
  <text start="724.52" dur="5.55">Cyprus France Italy you name it we see</text>
  <text start="727.76" dur="4.59">this happening here in the United States</text>
  <text start="730.07" dur="4.11">they can continually borrow the other</text>
  <text start="732.35" dur="4.86">countries have to go to the ECB and they</text>
  <text start="734.18" dur="5.67">have to try to get their funding here in</text>
  <text start="737.21" dur="5.34">the United States we we are like</text>
  <text start="739.85" dur="5.13">intertwined with the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="742.55" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ll just keep churning out currency</text>
  <text start="744.98" dur="5.82">and their biggest threat is the crypto</text>
  <text start="748.04" dur="6.96">the blockchain technology and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.8" dur="7.5">seeing right now is this fight and I do</text>
  <text start="755" dur="6.029">believe they are in process of bringing</text>
  <text start="758.3" dur="4.68">down the entire system at least they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.029" dur="4.5">going to try doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="762.98" dur="5.52">succeed because we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="765.529" dur="6.651">market is moving up and down today it</text>
  <text start="768.5" dur="6.3">opened down it went back up and their</text>
  <text start="772.18" dur="6.849">mission the central bankers mission is</text>
  <text start="774.8" dur="5.94">to bring down the system and blame it on</text>
  <text start="779.029" dur="4.321">Trump and you can see already with all</text>
  <text start="780.74" dur="4.17">the propaganda out there and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.35" dur="3.6">pushing this idea because you have to</text>
  <text start="784.91" dur="4.35">remember what is happening here their</text>
  <text start="786.95" dur="5.759">entire system which was based on the</text>
  <text start="789.26" dur="5.04">petrodollar it&amp;#39;s coming to an end all</text>
  <text start="792.709" dur="3.391">the Middle Eastern countries where we</text>
  <text start="794.3" dur="4.53">have regime change all the stuff that</text>
  <text start="796.1" dur="4.95">happened where we were forcing countries</text>
  <text start="798.83" dur="4.259">to use the petro dollar the whole the</text>
  <text start="801.05" dur="4.789">dollar reserves it&amp;#39;s all coming to an</text>
  <text start="803.089" dur="5.071">end one net once that system dies</text>
  <text start="805.839" dur="4.661">countries don&amp;#39;t have to hold the dollar</text>
  <text start="808.16" dur="4.65">they don&amp;#39;t have to purchase oil using</text>
  <text start="810.5" dur="4.7">the petro dollar they can use other</text>
  <text start="812.81" dur="5.52">currencies maybe like the petrol you won</text>
  <text start="815.2" dur="5.97">once that happens this is where things</text>
  <text start="818.33" dur="6.18">start to really really fall apart and we</text>
  <text start="821.17" dur="6.97">can see we&amp;#39;re approaching that situation</text>
  <text start="824.51" dur="7.1">very very quickly because the central</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="6.9">bankers their plan is to move their</text>
  <text start="831.61" dur="6.07">operation over to the next powerhouse</text>
  <text start="835.04" dur="5.1">which is China manufacturing everything</text>
  <text start="837.68" dur="6.36">that you need they have it the United</text>
  <text start="840.14" dur="7.77">States no longer does have it but for us</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="6.299">to join in on this new system we need to</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="6.21">build up our infrastructure</text>
  <text start="850.339" dur="4.861">now hopefully as time goes on because we</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="2.31">see that Putin</text>
  <text start="855.2" dur="2.55">has taken control over the private</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="3.54">western central bank in his country</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.5">eventually what will happen is that the</text>
  <text start="859.97" dur="3.9">people around the world will say listen</text>
  <text start="862.25" dur="4.71">we don&amp;#39;t want the central banking system</text>
  <text start="863.87" dur="5.16">we want the cryptocurrency we want</text>
  <text start="866.96" dur="4.26">blockchain we want a we want to take</text>
  <text start="869.03" dur="5.1">control over the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="871.22" dur="6.93">and we no longer need the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.13" dur="5.61">this would be the optimal solution to</text>
  <text start="878.15" dur="3.69">everything that is going on right now</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="4.14">and that&amp;#39;s why I do believe one of the</text>
  <text start="881.84" dur="4.08">missions of the Trump administration and</text>
  <text start="883.88" dur="3.99">those Patriots is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="885.92" dur="3.63">central bank I mean Andrew Jackson who</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="4.32">was hanging on the wall in the White</text>
  <text start="889.55" dur="4.68">House he&amp;#39;s the one who got rid of the</text>
  <text start="892.19" dur="3.6">central banks because they realized the</text>
  <text start="894.23" dur="4.5">founding fathers if you go back in time</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="4.86">they realized what the central bank</text>
  <text start="898.73" dur="4.62">actually does the central bank creates</text>
  <text start="900.65" dur="5.52">war the central bank creates corruption</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="4.44">the central bank is the root of all the</text>
  <text start="906.17" dur="3.3">problems a lot of the problems that we</text>
  <text start="907.79" dur="3.84">have today yes we&amp;#39;ll still have other</text>
  <text start="909.47" dur="5.19">problems and things like that but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.63" dur="4.59">a big chunk of the problems and we can</text>
  <text start="914.66" dur="4.14">see already that the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="916.22" dur="4.11">deep state intertwine with the central</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="3.48">bank they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing their</text>
  <text start="920.33" dur="4.71">agenda because they have no choice left</text>
  <text start="922.28" dur="5.31">they have nothing left here their backs</text>
  <text start="925.04" dur="4.41">are against the wall and they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="927.59" dur="4.44">see the economy fail and everything we</text>
  <text start="929.45" dur="4.92">blamed on Trump then have the economy</text>
  <text start="932.03" dur="4.05">transition into something else that has</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="3.93">nothing to do with the central bank and</text>
  <text start="936.08" dur="4.32">if the central bank goes away the deep</text>
  <text start="938.3" dur="4.62">state loses all its funding and they</text>
  <text start="940.4" dur="5.28">will have a very difficult time pushing</text>
  <text start="942.92" dur="3.87">their agenda so we can see all of this</text>
  <text start="945.68" dur="2.25">is intertwined everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.79" dur="2.76">happening the middle east everything</text>
  <text start="947.93" dur="6.51">that&amp;#39;s happening around the world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.55" dur="8.55">all intertwined into one gigantic mess</text>
  <text start="954.44" dur="5.94">and right now we&amp;#39;re trying to commander</text>
  <text start="958.1" dur="5.01">this mess into something a lot better</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="4.74">than where we were and hopefully we can</text>
  <text start="963.11" dur="4.86">get there it looks like it&amp;#39;s working but</text>
  <text start="965.12" dur="5.88">again the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state</text>
  <text start="967.97" dur="4.44">they play dirty so no matter what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="971" dur="3.24">gonna be going through a transition</text>
