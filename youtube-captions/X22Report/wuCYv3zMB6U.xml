  <text start="58.059" dur="6.93">this is episode 1503 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.87" dur="5.64">is February 20th 2018 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.989" dur="6.481">the episode is this is where the next</text>
  <text start="67.51" dur="6.45">economic crisis is hiding let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.47" dur="4.02">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="4.29">we have been seeing a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="75.49" dur="4.32">where their brick-and-mortar sales they</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="3.54">haven&amp;#39;t been doing well we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="79.81" dur="5.339">seeing the online sales they have been</text>
  <text start="81.79" dur="6.03">haven&amp;#39;t been doing well and each store</text>
  <text start="85.149" dur="3.991">continually pops up that says oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="87.82" dur="3.63">not gonna be able to make it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.14" dur="4.11">gonna have to declare bankruptcy online</text>
  <text start="91.45" dur="4.529">sales is not what they thought it was</text>
  <text start="93.25" dur="6.24">going to be and Walmart is out there now</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="7.411">and they have a disappointing fourth</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="6.239">quarter ecommerce sales they have slowed</text>
  <text start="103.39" dur="4.589">they only rose about 23% in the fourth</text>
  <text start="105.729" dur="4.92">quarter and we have to remember this is</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="5.011">during the holiday season this is down</text>
  <text start="110.649" dur="5.071">from an average of about 50% in the last</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="5.339">three quarters so this is not too good</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="5.73">for Walmart we also see that their</text>
  <text start="118.329" dur="6.571">earnings have missed and it looks like</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="5.19">things are rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="124.9" dur="4.32">very quickly now we know let a lot of</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="4.5">people use food stamps within Walmart to</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="4.049">purchase their groceries but again</text>
  <text start="131.14" dur="5.73">people who are buying online aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.269" dur="5.521">using food stamps so we can see that</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="4.5">there are things that are breaking down</text>
  <text start="138.79" dur="4.44">and when people don&amp;#39;t have jobs when</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="3.899">people have a difficult time finding</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="3.27">jobs when their retail stores are</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="3.631">closing and there&amp;#39;s a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.38">jobs that are just completely being</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="3.69">wiped out and many corporations that are</text>
  <text start="150.88" dur="4.35">continually laying off you need to start</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="4.8">to think to yourself do these</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="4.17">unemployment numbers make any sense</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="4.89">whatsoever and we&amp;#39;ve gone over it many</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="4.77">many times and just because we have a</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="5.01">new president doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything has</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="6.599">changed nothing has changed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="7.169">still using the same exact calculation</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="4.711">as they did before now before we were</text>
  <text start="174.459" dur="5.06">saying that it was completely</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="7.5">manipulated it&amp;#39;s still manipulated and</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="6.131">the jobs just aren&amp;#39;t there right now</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="3.35">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that aren&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="5">huge</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="6.6">amount of debt and the debt levels they</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="5.01">keep growing much faster than the</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="5.97">overall economy I mean think about it we</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="4.95">haven&amp;#39;t had a year of 3% growth for the</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="4.32">US economy since the middle of the Bush</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="6.18">administration but we keep borrowing</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="6.03">money as if there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow much of</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="4.83">the focus has been on the exploding debt</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="4.98">of the federal government and that is</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="5.58">definitely something that we need to</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="5.7">look at but when we look at individuals</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.95">the individual debt level you as</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="6.18">consumers they&amp;#39;ve been extremely</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="6.21">irresponsible as well why because this</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="5.01">is the only way people can survive when</text>
  <text start="228.36" dur="4.32">the dollar loses value and you need more</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="5.76">and more of these dollars to pay for</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="6.84">your merchandise you resort to credit</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.68">when your job doesn&amp;#39;t give you a raise</text>
  <text start="239.52" dur="4.83">you need to resort to credit when you</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.52">can&amp;#39;t find a job you need to resort to</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="4.44">credit when you find a new job but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="3.689">making a lot less than you were and your</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="4.38">bills are still the same you resort to</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.671">credit this is what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="5.55">now in fact one new survey has found</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="6.02">that more than 80 percent of all</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="6.21">American adults are currently in debt</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="4.42">eighty point nine percent of baby</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.65">boomers are in debt seventy nine point</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.74">nine percent of Gen Xers and at eighty</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="4.56">one point eight five eighty one point</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="6.21">five percent of Millennials they are in</text>
  <text start="274.14" dur="5.82">debt for most of us it starts very early</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re told that going into debt to get</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="3.75">the college education would not be a</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="5.4">problem because we would be able to pay</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="5.04">those loans off with good jobs you know</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="2.94">those jobs that you get right after</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="4.41">graduation where you&amp;#39;re getting a nice</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="6.05">salary but it&amp;#39;s not happening those good</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="5.819">jobs never never really materialized and</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="5.89">many people are saying now what do I do</text>
  <text start="298.979" dur="5.821">they get part-time jobs and now millions</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="5.76">of former college graduates are drowning</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="5.58">in debt a study released Friday by the</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="4.32">Brookings Institution finds that most</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="3.93">borrowers who left school owing at least</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="4.95">fifty thousand in student loans in 2010</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="5.43">had failed to pay down any of their debt</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="3.12">four years later instead their balances</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="3.149">had</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="5.97">on average risen by 5% as interest</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="5.881">accrued on their debt as of 2014 there</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="5.31">were about 5 million borrowers with</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="5.04">large loan balances and out of 40</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.2">million Americans total with student</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="3.84">debt large balanced borrowers</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.17">represented about 17% of student</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="6.72">borrowers leaving college or grad school</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="7.8">in 2014 up from 2% of all borrowers in</text>

  <text start="347.79" dur="4.11">and state and federal government debt</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="5.579">levels are all record highs right now</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="5.22">and it is now being projected that our</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="6.151">national debt will hit about 30 trillion</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="6.12">by 2028 and those projections are</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="3.599">probably very optimistic it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="5.06">gonna be a lot higher than that if we</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="7.051">ever make it that far under this system</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="6.76">now we can see that there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="371.97" dur="6.03">things lurking in the darkness where</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="5.639">these things could kick off the next</text>
  <text start="378" dur="5.669">economic crisis the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="380.699" dur="5.431">reported most recently two weeks ago US</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="6.331">consumer non-mortgage debt has never</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="6.539">been higher as December 31st 2017 US</text>

  <text start="401.58" dur="5.13">these credit card and auto loans in</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="5.03">particular have been experiencing</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="7.26">accelerated delinquencies as a result</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="5.98">finance companies and banks have been</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="4.02">increasing bad debt provisions to build</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="4.89">balance sheet reserves due to</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="4.59">expectations of rising defaults and we</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="5.58">can definitely see this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="6">happening now the larger banks they have</text>
  <text start="426.66" dur="4.56">been dominating the credit card issuance</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="5.339">and they&amp;#39;ve been focusing on prime and</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="5.64">subprime consumers and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="5.611">focusing on these two groups since the</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="4.23">great financial crisis and they have</text>
  <text start="439.53" dur="3.96">enjoyed a prolonged period of low</text>
  <text start="441.09" dur="6.54">charged-off rates concurrent with the</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="8.94">feds almost decade-long program observe</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="7.25">however since 2015 the Fed has</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="5.69">progressively raised interest rates for</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="6.12">while NCOs at the larger banks have</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="6.08">started to rise and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="461" dur="6.96">that the interest rates are rising</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="6.46">America&amp;#39;s smaller banks those not in the</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="4.5">top 100 by asset size that have</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="5.37">experienced in just the recent months a</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="6.09">surge in charge-off deterioration which</text>
  <text start="476.03" dur="5.79">at 7.9 percent is on par with the last</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="5.82">financial crisis in other words to find</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="7.14">where the next consumer credit crisis</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="8.1">hides and will erupt next ignore the big</text>
  <text start="488.96" dur="7.29">banks and completely take your focus and</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="6.3">focus it on the smaller ones now</text>
  <text start="496.25" dur="4.76">this spike in net charge-offs among</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="5.25">smaller banks has gone largely unnoticed</text>
  <text start="501.01" dur="4.81">by the general media which has</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="4.38">traditionally focused on aggregate</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="5.31">numbers and also a larger Bank and they</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="4.8">completely don&amp;#39;t even look at the</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="4.47">smaller banks and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.47">the smaller banks they are going to be</text>
  <text start="515.6" dur="4.68">in trouble once this starts to</text>
  <text start="517.67" dur="5.25">accelerate and if we look at the US bank</text>
  <text start="520.28" dur="6.81">credit loans and securities we can see</text>
  <text start="522.92" dur="7.94">back in the year of 2008 we hit around</text>
  <text start="527.09" dur="8.28">63 percent right now we are approaching</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="7.96">65 percent and and this is what what</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="7.02">this is is loans and securities to GDP</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="6.41">and we are way above where we were back</text>
  <text start="542.39" dur="5.16">in 2008 now this could be the next</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.48">kickoff to the crisis just like the</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="3.15">subprime securities where no one was</text>
  <text start="549.71" dur="2.85">looking at them saying they were</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="3.12">triple-a everything&amp;#39;s fine and then we</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="4.29">come to find out that they were a</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="5.82">complete garbage the same thing here yes</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="5.28">the larger banks they&amp;#39;re taken care of</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="4.2">but the smaller banks they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="562.13" dur="4.02">in trouble and it looks like this could</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="4.8">be where the next economic crisis is</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="4.68">really kicked off unless the central</text>
  <text start="568.64" dur="4.8">bank goes ahead and brings down the</text>
  <text start="570.83" dur="4.17">economy themselves because they want to</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="5.61">control it but if you&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="575" dur="6.51">black swan this could be where it starts</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="4.2">now the BLS and the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="3.12">all out there the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.25" dur="3.84">trying to convince us that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="3.6">inflation whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="3.66">over the last 20 year</text>
  <text start="588.23" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ve seen about 55 point six percent</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="6.54">inflation that&amp;#39;s it which means it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="4.92">about 2.4 percent annually over that</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="5.22">period of time</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="6.33">now the BLS shows the cost of housing up</text>
  <text start="602.51" dur="5.64">about 56 percent over the last 20 years</text>
  <text start="604.61" dur="5.54">now let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at this to</text>
  <text start="608.15" dur="5.43">see if what they&amp;#39;re telling us is</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="8.17">actually true now the average new home</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="8.76">cost back in 1997 was around 175,000</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="7.89">dollars the average new home in 2017</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="6.06">cost about 380,000 and if we do the math</text>
  <text start="626.21" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s about a hundred and seventeen</text>
  <text start="628.4" dur="5.37">percent increase the average monthly</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="6.06">rent in 1997 was about a five hundred</text>
  <text start="633.77" dur="7.43">and seventy-six dollars in 2017 it was</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="7.44">1021 seventy seven percent increase</text>
  <text start="641.2" dur="7.36">housing is the biggest weighting in the</text>
  <text start="644.75" dur="6.3">CPI calculation since using actual cost</text>
  <text start="648.56" dur="6.12">increases would show at least 90 percent</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="6.54">increase in housing the BLS created a</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="6.09">fake calculation called owners</text>
  <text start="657.59" dur="7.38">equivalent rent which no one can</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="6.09">question so basically they manipulated</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="5.04">these numbers to make us believe that</text>
  <text start="666.86" dur="5.43">inflation is really not that bad because</text>
  <text start="670.01" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s how you get fake housing</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="3.24">inflation but you just look at the</text>
  <text start="673.37" dur="3.84">numbers and you can see yes</text>
  <text start="675.53" dur="5.1">there there&amp;#39;s inflation all over the</text>
  <text start="677.21" dur="6.3">place actually look at the look at look</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="5.52">at new cars the average price of a new</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="4.5">car in 1997 was nineteen thousand two</text>
  <text start="686.15" dur="3.99">hundred fourteen the average price of a</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="4.65">new car in 2017 was thirty three</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="4.26">thousand five hundred and sixty does</text>
  <text start="692.66" dur="3.18">that strike you as a zero percent</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="4.32">increase that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="695.84" dur="7.22">tell us actually it&amp;#39;s about seventy five</text>

  <text start="766.88" dur="7.709">car now how far does my dollar get me</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="4.68">nowhere now we see that certain banks</text>
  <text start="774.589" dur="5.641">they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="775.43" dur="9.21">the bailed out mega bank RBS hasn&amp;#39;t had</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="7.979">a year in the black since 2007 now two</text>
  <text start="784.64" dur="7.43">weeks ago this Bank was brought up on</text>
  <text start="788.209" dur="6.331">charges that they were forging customer</text>
  <text start="792.07" dur="5.19">signatures that they trained staff to do</text>
  <text start="794.54" dur="5.54">this and the senior management</text>
  <text start="797.26" dur="6.72">completely denied the whole thing and</text>
  <text start="800.08" dur="7.54">they&amp;#39;re saying that this never happened</text>
  <text start="803.98" dur="6.66">well it looks like management is going</text>
  <text start="807.62" dur="6.63">to have to walk back those denials and</text>
  <text start="810.64" dur="6.4">we can see that they were forging</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="7.37">documents they train their staff to do</text>
  <text start="817.04" dur="8.43">so and we see that a retired teacher</text>
  <text start="821.62" dur="6.339">Jean McKay came forward with paperwork</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="5.46">that clearly showed her signature was</text>
  <text start="827.959" dur="5.191">forged on a bank document the bank</text>
  <text start="830.93" dur="4.95">refused to admit any wrongdoing although</text>
  <text start="833.15" dur="5.85">it did agree to refund her fees as well</text>
  <text start="835.88" dur="5.1">as interest for mrs. McKay that was not</text>
  <text start="839" dur="4.23">enough she wanted an apology and an</text>
  <text start="840.98" dur="4.41">admission of guilt from her bank now</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="4.35">years later and with the public&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="4.34">attention fixed squarely on RBS forgery</text>
  <text start="847.58" dur="5.85">scandal she&amp;#39;s finally got it a</text>
  <text start="849.73" dur="5.919">graphologist recently confirmed that the</text>
  <text start="853.43" dur="4.709">signatures on the document are</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="4.891">indeed not a match the bank&amp;#39;s response</text>
  <text start="858.139" dur="5.01">was immediate it apologized to mrs.</text>
  <text start="860.54" dur="5.399">McKay and offered her a whopping five</text>
  <text start="863.149" dur="4.201">hundred dollars in compensation it also</text>
  <text start="865.939" dur="4.02">have bended committing forgery but</text>
  <text start="867.35" dur="4.38">claimed it was an isolated incident and</text>
  <text start="869.959" dur="4.74">eventually what were most likely gonna</text>
  <text start="871.73" dur="5.359">find out that it wasn&amp;#39;t just look at the</text>
  <text start="874.699" dur="5.521">banks and what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past</text>
  <text start="877.089" dur="6.131">you could see why people would like to</text>
  <text start="880.22" dur="5.089">go to cryptocurrencies where they would</text>
  <text start="883.22" dur="5.25">like to bypass these banking</text>
  <text start="885.309" dur="4.931">institutions because they&amp;#39;re not in it</text>
  <text start="888.47" dur="4.38">for their customers they&amp;#39;re in it for</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="7.199">themselves and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="892.85" dur="7.37">prepared and ready to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="897.439" dur="6.661">have to do to make sure that their</text>
  <text start="900.22" dur="6.82">institutions stay afloat and we could</text>
  <text start="904.1" dur="5.07">see right now with the robo-signing</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="4.739">with everything that&amp;#39;s been going on in</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="4.56">the past with Wells Fargo with mortgages</text>
  <text start="911.779" dur="5.581">and everything else we can see that</text>
  <text start="913.73" dur="5.639">people are losing trust in the banking</text>
  <text start="917.36" dur="4.229">system especially now that you get no</text>
  <text start="919.369" dur="3.9">interest on your money inside the bank</text>
  <text start="921.589" dur="3.66">what is the reason to use the bank what</text>
  <text start="923.269" dur="3.51">to pay your bills you really don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="925.249" dur="3.69">a bank for that we can get off that</text>
  <text start="926.779" dur="4.081">system and move to something completely</text>
  <text start="928.939" dur="4.08">different but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="5.579">now is a complete and utter breakdown of</text>
  <text start="933.019" dur="6.091">the system and we&amp;#39;re seeing that there</text>
  <text start="936.439" dur="5.64">are many different black swans lurking</text>
  <text start="939.11" dur="5.639">in the dark which are just gonna come</text>
  <text start="942.079" dur="5.1">right out and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="944.749" dur="5.07">central banks they&amp;#39;ve been pushing their</text>
  <text start="947.179" dur="5.371">agenda to bring down the economy before</text>
  <text start="949.819" dur="5.82">a black swan hits so we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="952.55" dur="6.089">things happening all at once we see</text>
  <text start="955.639" dur="5.49">banks once again are dishonest the</text>
  <text start="958.639" dur="5.581">central bankers they&amp;#39;re in it for profit</text>
  <text start="961.129" dur="7.26">and all of this is coming to a head</text>
  <text start="964.22" dur="7.589">right now we can see that their time is</text>
  <text start="968.389" dur="5.94">coming to an end this is why we have the</text>
  <text start="971.809" dur="5.101">birth of cryptocurrency this is why</text>
  <text start="974.329" dur="4.23">people are starting to move towards</text>
  <text start="976.91" dur="4.739">cryptocurrency this is what corporations</text>
  <text start="978.559" dur="5.4">and employers are starting to look at</text>
  <text start="981.649" dur="5.37">cryptocurrencies because you can do</text>
  <text start="983.959" dur="5.341">almost everything today without a bank</text>
  <text start="987.019" dur="5.371">without the central bank</text>
  <text start="989.3" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them and guess</text>
  <text start="992.39" dur="5.43">what the central bank the bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="994.49" dur="5.039">don&amp;#39;t like this they don&amp;#39;t like it at</text>
  <text start="997.82" dur="3.42">all and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="999.529" dur="4.111">to stop it but we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1001.24" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re headed towards this transition</text>
  <text start="1003.64" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s either going to be a central</text>
