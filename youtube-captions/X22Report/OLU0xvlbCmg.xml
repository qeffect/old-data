  <text start="121.15" dur="5.1">and what do I mean by this well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.67" dur="3.87">start off with the brexit the people</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="2.34">decided you know something we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="127.54" dur="4.14">to be part of the EU</text>
  <text start="128.59" dur="6.149">we&amp;#39;d like to separate from the EU it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="131.68" dur="5.54">non elected body and we would like to do</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="6.33">this by having a vote the people voted</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.92">then the government the EU decided to</text>
  <text start="141.069" dur="4.56">try to stop them by creating this</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="4.44">ridiculous deal which the people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.629" dur="4.261">want and the people said no you know</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="5.75">what we reject this we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re not voting through this plan and</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="6.189">then we had Nigel Faraj he decided you</text>
  <text start="157.33" dur="4.71">know something the government the way it</text>
  <text start="159.519" dur="4.991">is right now is not doing what they</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="4.6">promised so he started the brexit party</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="4.289">and now the brexit party is on the verge</text>
  <text start="166.64" dur="4.519">of overtaking the Tories from zero</text>
  <text start="168.799" dur="4.55">members to a hundred thousand in just</text>
  <text start="171.159" dur="5.8">five weeks</text>
  <text start="173.349" dur="5.831">what does that mean it means that people</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="5.521">are waking up people are starting to</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="6.36">realize something is wrong and now they</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="5.25">are speaking out Nigel Farage said the</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="4.05">BBC isn&amp;#39;t as denial the Tory and labor</text>
  <text start="187.73" dur="3.149">parties are in denial he says I think</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.319">you&amp;#39;re all in for a bigger surprise this</text>
  <text start="190.879" dur="6.33">week than you could even imagine the</text>
  <text start="193.909" dur="6.5">biggest denier of them all is Theresa</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="8.191">May and they have a new slogan now</text>
  <text start="200.409" dur="10.061">change politics for good the brexit</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="10.679">party listen to what Nigel Farage has to</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="8.34">say he has some exciting news what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="216.079" dur="4.171">saying is if the brexit party could win</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="4.59">these elections next week and win them</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="3.69">well leaving with no deal is back on the</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="2.759">table</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m gonna demand that we have</text>
  <text start="226.159" dur="3.33">representation in those negotiations</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="3.81">because we&amp;#39;ll have a democratic mandate</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="4.921">to do so and I think misses may all be</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="5.49">gone within a few weeks we may just get</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="5.969">a prime minister who for fear of the</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="5.459">brexit party says we&amp;#39;re leaving on the</text>
  <text start="240.379" dur="4.651">31st regardless now this is going to be</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="6.06">very interesting as we approach may 31st</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="6.9">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we saw events</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="5.22">if we saw scare tactics by the EU I</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="6.75">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we saw any of</text>
  <text start="254.269" dur="6.391">that but if the brexit party wins or</text>
  <text start="258.68" dur="5.85">should I say when the brexit party wins</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="5.789">we&amp;#39;re gonna see change which means the</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="4.56">people are in control and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="266.449" dur="5.881">happening in the UK I mean look at Italy</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="5.52">right now look at hungry look at many of</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="7.82">these countries that are rejecting the</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="8.15">EU in Australia they just had elections</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="5.049">they were held they were compulsory</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="4.96">everyone over the age 18 is required to</text>
  <text start="285.199" dur="5.491">vote the turnout was greater than 95%</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="5.85">and all the media and pollsters they</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="6.08">were completely shocked they didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="5.14">what happened the conservative coalition</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.44">received a stunning</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.51">unexpected unanticipated victory</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="6.04">Australian prime minister Scott Morrison</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="6.54">has won the election the 2019 media in</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="4.7">Australia looks very similar and</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="5.11">identical to the media in the US</text>
  <text start="312.95" dur="7.32">November 2016 during the elections at</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="6.69">that point now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="5.95">Morrison was running on the platform up</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="5.58">for the economy immigration a push back</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="4.34">against the insufferable climate change</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="9.18">nonsense I mean this sounds very</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="10.56">familiar to Trump and he won so now we</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="9.29">have the UK Australia Italy Hungary and</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="8.73">many other countries that are waking up</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="7.06">everyone is starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="6.43">they want change they don&amp;#39;t want what</text>
  <text start="353.67" dur="4.8">the globalists were giving us actually I</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t think that people ever wanted what</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="5.22">the globalist were giving us I believe</text>
  <text start="360.42" dur="5.82">the mainstream media the globalist they</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="5.22">were all together pushing a message that</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="4.98">no one really wanted because as you can</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="4.95">see in all these countries people are</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="8.52">starting to wake up now why is this</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="9.57">important because these people in these</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="6.78">countries they realize that the path</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="6.47">that we are headed down was not a good</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="6.56">path for the economy for the country and</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re rejecting globalism which means</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="5.35">we&amp;#39;re going to be pushing for a</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="5.34">rejection of the central bank now think</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="5.61">about what German Chancellor Angela</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="6.45">Merkel said she thinks the post-world</text>
  <text start="404.04" dur="6.78">War two global order as we know it is</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="6.23">over and now she grouped the United</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="6.84">States with China and Russia as</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="8.65">adversaries of Europe now all of Europe</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="6.39">is not with Germany or with Angela</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.44">Merkel because I&amp;#39;m sure the people in</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="4.35">Germany are like you know something we</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="5.58">need a change also and we know that</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="6.08">English I decided not to run</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="6.6">and what she&amp;#39;s saying here is that</text>
  <text start="434.48" dur="5.95">globalism is dead she said there is no</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="4.8">doubt that Europe needs to reposition</text>
