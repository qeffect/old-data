  <text start="81.56" dur="3.57">have to see if he&amp;#39;s going to keep these</text>
  <text start="83" dur="3.96">promises because we need to look at his</text>

  <text start="99.92" dur="4.83">until we see his actions until we see</text>
  <text start="101.93" dur="3.93">what he does it&amp;#39;s very difficult to say</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="2.81">at this point I know people are out</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="5.27">there screaming all different things and</text>
  <text start="107.56" dur="6.339">they&amp;#39;re using their emotions to get</text>
  <text start="111.13" dur="5.38">involved in this whole thing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="4.711">really looking at the actual facts of</text>
  <text start="116.51" dur="3.27">what&amp;#39;s going on they just want to go</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="2.46">with whatever the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="3.57">saying they go off of that and they say</text>
  <text start="121.07" dur="4.589">ah see he&amp;#39;s a racist he&amp;#39;s this he&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="123.35" dur="4.41">and which is absolute ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s meaningless but we could see what</text>
  <text start="127.76" dur="4.74">the corporate media is doing they want a</text>
  <text start="129.769" dur="4.351">country that is divided right now we</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="4.29">know the central bank we know Soros and</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="4.14">others they want a divided country they</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="3.509">want the people to fight against each</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="6.93">other they&amp;#39;re most likely hoping for a</text>
  <text start="140.299" dur="7.381">civil war they want complete chaos but</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="5.67">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="5.82">Trump is making different plans with his</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="6.18">transition team and one of the things he</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="6.12">said is that officials will be banned</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="5.759">from lobbying for five years after they</text>
  <text start="159.62" dur="4.95">leave the administration and which I</text>
  <text start="162.799" dur="3.481">agree with they shouldn&amp;#39;t have anything</text>
  <text start="164.57" dur="3.09">to do with lobbyists because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="3.48">seeing right now is a lot of government</text>
  <text start="167.66" dur="3.87">officials they say oh let me go from</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.86">this position right to becoming a</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="5.25">lobbyist they get paid very very well so</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="5.22">Donald Trump announces tough new anti</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="4.77">lobbying band for all his staff people</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="4.17">on the president elects transition team</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="3.51">cannot be lobbyists they also cannot</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="4.79">lobby for any</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="5.46">for 45 years after leaving his team</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="2.92">incoming officials for the</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="4.56">administration will be subject to the</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="5.34">same band and we can see that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="195.08" dur="4.17">good thing that he&amp;#39;s doing but there are</text>
  <text start="197.06" dur="5.1">certain other things that I completely</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="4.769">don&amp;#39;t agree with but again he&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="3.659">beginning stages of this a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="204.019" dur="4.47">talk a lot of it the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="5.341">blowing at a proportion but we will have</text>
  <text start="208.489" dur="6.33">to wait and see let&amp;#39;s not get our</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="7.23">emotions involved in this let&amp;#39;s see what</text>
  <text start="214.819" dur="5.461">he does what action he performs when</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="4.29">Obama came into office everyone said</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="4.019">okay we have this new person he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.4">to create change it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="7.351">great thing and all of a sudden his</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="7.08">actions showed the opposite and as time</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="6.3">went on it got worse and worse here we</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="4.79">have the opposite thing where everyone</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="4.68">is out there screaming and yelling that</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="5.47">Trump is not my present he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="5.25">the worst thing ever it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="245.42" dur="4.2">like in Germany during Hitler time I</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="7.59">mean you&amp;#39;re here all these different</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="8.48">things but again put emotions aside look</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="6.47">at the actions look at the facts</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="5.92">research exactly what is going on and</text>
  <text start="261.94" dur="4.42">what&amp;#39;s very funny I&amp;#39;ll bring up one</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="5.04">point here I know during the campaign</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="5.55">Hillary had her campaign ads and they</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="4.979">showed Obama flailing his arms and he</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="4.77">said they were he was making fun of a</text>
  <text start="274.039" dur="6.361">disabled reporter and yes that reporter</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.459">does have one of his arms crawled up but</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="6.019">when you look at Trump&amp;#39;s videos in the</text>
  <text start="282.139" dur="8.521">past do you know he does that when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.419" dur="6.25">talking about different people when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.66" dur="4.77">trying to make a point he did it with</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="4.171">Ted Cruz and if you go back with</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="4.109">different videos when he&amp;#39;s speaking</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="5.25">about different people and he makes kind</text>
  <text start="299.539" dur="5.431">of like makes fun of them and tries to</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="6.63">imitate them he does that with his hands</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="6.93">and it wasn&amp;#39;t specific to that reporter</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="5.16">because he actually does this over and</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="4.44">over and over if you go back in time and</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="4.86">you look at his speeches and what he</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="3.87">does he does do those whammo</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="3.87">but we know what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="3.78">wanted to do they wanted to say oh look</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="2.85">he&amp;#39;s making fun of the perp in because</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="4.17">they wanted to use it during their</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="5.13">campaign just like the racist comments</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="5.52">and all this other stuff but we have to</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="5.579">look through the propaganda that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="5.73">putting out there and go past us just</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="7.101">like Bannon who he wants to bring on to</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="6.539">his team well he works for Breitbart</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="5.799">Breitbart was started by Andrew by Bart</text>
  <text start="345.949" dur="6.331">which which he was Jewish they have many</text>
  <text start="349.069" dur="6.901">Jewish people working there Joel Pollock</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="6.9">is the senior editor in Breitbart he is</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="6.539">Jewish so it it&amp;#39;s the argument kind of</text>
  <text start="359.18" dur="6.54">falls apart but they continually try to</text>
  <text start="362.509" dur="4.681">push this on everyone and we need to do</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.74">a little bit of research and a little</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="5.37">bit of fact-finding to see wait what the</text>
  <text start="370.46" dur="4.59">corporate media is that really true or</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="4.74">are they just using this as let me see</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="3.869">what they call it clickbait because</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s what they like to call the</text>
  <text start="378.919" dur="4.831">alternative media when they put out</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="5.939">headlines but we see the corporate media</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="4.65">well they do the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="386.659" dur="4.861">that&amp;#39;s real news everything the</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="5.34">alternative media does is fake news now</text>
  <text start="391.52" dur="5.54">out in New York there is a mysterious</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="5.28">dark skyscraper in New York City and</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="4.599">everyone looks at it and they say oh</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s an AT&amp;amp;T building but what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="6.451">come to find out is that this long lines</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="9.44">building in New York that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="12.39">known as is not just an ATT hub it is an</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="6.91">NSA surveillance facility there was an</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="4.56">investigation done by the intercept</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="4.859">which found that Project X building this</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="4.71">building was constructed to withstand an</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="5.131">atomic blast in house and feed about</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="6.36">1,500 people for two weeks is the host</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="8.28">to the NSA and it works with AT&amp;amp;T to</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="5.7">conduct mass surveillance and documents</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="4.83">that were obtained by the intercept from</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="5.79">NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden says</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="4.32">that the architectural plans the public</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="4.949">records the interviews with former 18t</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="5.489">employees well they say yes</text>
  <text start="452.569" dur="7.08">this is an NSA surveillance site</text>
  <text start="454.999" dur="6.361">code-named Titan point and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.649" dur="7.44">seeing that this is part of a bigger</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="10.919">system it&amp;#39;s part of a bigger wider spy</text>
  <text start="467.089" dur="7.29">system and basically Titan point is one</text>
  <text start="472.279" dur="6.301">of three course sites of the Blarney</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="6.361">program there are links to 18t routers</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="5.729">operates powerful satellite antenna on</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="8.159">the roof and they suck up internet data</text>
  <text start="484.309" dur="8.16">and we can see right now that we know</text>
  <text start="488.899" dur="7.44">from past reports that AT&amp;amp;T they have</text>
  <text start="492.469" dur="5.641">designed software that spies on people</text>
  <text start="496.339" dur="3.69">and that information is then given over</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="3.929">to the government and we can see from</text>
  <text start="500.029" dur="5.79">this they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a very</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="7.261">long time for those people who own an</text>
  <text start="505.819" dur="5.64">iPhone where iphone was Apple was out</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="4.349">there saying that iphone is very secure</text>
  <text start="511.459" dur="4.82">we have encryption don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="513.649" dur="6.99">well it looks like there is a problem</text>
  <text start="516.279" dur="8.11">because there&amp;#39;s a Russian digital</text>
  <text start="520.639" dur="7.88">forensic firm elcomsoft found that if</text>
  <text start="524.389" dur="8.851">you have the iCloud on and it&amp;#39;s enabled</text>
  <text start="528.519" dur="7.091">data gets uploaded to the cloud and</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re talking about your phone records</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="7.26">your facetime conversations all of that</text>
  <text start="539" dur="10.92">is kept up on the omnia cloud and this</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="10.38">goes back all the way to iOS 8.2 and the</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="6.089">government says well that&amp;#39;s an open area</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="4.439">we can access that data that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="556.009" dur="3.711">come under privacy or violation of the</text>
  <text start="557.689" dur="4.801">Fourth Amendment we can just take that</text>
  <text start="559.72" dur="6.52">so we can see right now most of these</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="7.07">firms well they do it in all different</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="6.06">ways to get the data to the government</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="4.509">because the government wants this</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="3.51">information they&amp;#39;re spying on the people</text>
  <text start="574.069" dur="4.741">and of course with the USA Freedom Act</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="4.829">they want all the corporations to spy on</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="4.19">the people and all they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="580.639" dur="5.201">is collect it since these corporations</text>
  <text start="583" dur="5.66">already have everything built in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="4.47">much easier for them and this is what</text>
  <text start="588.66" dur="4.44">they have done now we know the</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="4.47">government is continually spying on the</text>
  <text start="593.1" dur="6.9">American people it has not stopped at</text>
  <text start="594.78" dur="8.25">all and we see the chief of the spy</text>
  <text start="600" dur="7.02">organization the NSA well he is</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="8.07">resigning right now and he is leaving</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="6.12">office and it looks like Trump is going</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="6.41">to have to fill this position now we</text>
  <text start="613.14" dur="6.84">understand the UK had their brexit and</text>
  <text start="617.51" dur="4.06">they had the referendum which is just an</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="4.26">advisory referendum and it looks like</text>
  <text start="621.57" dur="6.06">the powers that be the EU they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="624.24" dur="7.47">to use whatever they have to to keep the</text>
  <text start="627.63" dur="9.26">UK in the EU they don&amp;#39;t want them to</text>
  <text start="631.71" dur="9.48">leave so already they say if the UK</text>
  <text start="636.89" dur="8.86">decided to leave the EU the EU</text>
  <text start="641.19" dur="7.8">Commission will place a travel tax on</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="6.06">British citizens after they leave the EU</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="4.11">the system would also mean the UK</text>
  <text start="651.81" dur="5.55">citizens would have to fill out a form</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="5.7">to travel to an EU country the British</text>
  <text start="657.36" dur="4.29">people will no longer be able to travel</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="6.21">freely to Europe without paying a travel</text>
  <text start="661.65" dur="5.28">tax so we can see already what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.01" dur="4.65">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="666.93" dur="5.07">people think twice about this if you</text>
  <text start="669.66" dur="4.83">want this to happen these are the</text>
  <text start="672" dur="4.86">penalties this is what the central</text>
  <text start="674.49" dur="4.47">bank&amp;#39;s always do look at the United</text>
  <text start="676.86" dur="4.65">States if you don&amp;#39;t sign up for health</text>
  <text start="678.96" dur="5.7">care we have a penalty for you if you</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t believe in climate change global</text>
  <text start="684.66" dur="4.44">warming and I know the climate is always</text>
  <text start="686.52" dur="4.41">changing but I&amp;#39;m talking about what</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re saying is that people are</text>
  <text start="690.93" dur="4.32">causing this guess what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="692.85" dur="6.18">impose a penalty on you and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="695.25" dur="6.66">to call it a carbon tax this is the same</text>
  <text start="699.03" dur="5.28">thing they always do if the people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="701.91" dur="4.86">do what they want they don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re saying they don&amp;#39;t abide by</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="7.89">the rules they place penalties they make</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="7.35">it difficult for the people and we can</text>
