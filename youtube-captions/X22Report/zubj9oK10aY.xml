  <text start="56.07" dur="5.399">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="6.24">this is episode 1342 B and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="4.981">is July 26 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="5.97">episode is the moment of truth is upon</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="5.91">us which path are we going down let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="4.59">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="5.939">and geopolitical news now it looks like</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="6.15">Trump has been all over sessions this</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="4.981">entire week it looks like he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="6.45">push sessions into doing his job</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="6.539">investigating leaks going after those</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.639">who broke laws like maybe you know for</text>
  <text start="89.819" dur="5.16">unmasking going after sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="4.71">where they shouldn&amp;#39;t be receiving funds</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.32">anymore and it looks like Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.36">is taking the first step right now and</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="4.74">it looks like he&amp;#39;s starting to proceed</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="5.64">on certain issues one of them being the</text>
  <text start="104.039" dur="5.19">sanctuary cities he has begun cutting</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="4.441">funding to the sanctuary cities and once</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.411">again this is all about the immigration</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="4.259">plan that Obama set up where he bust</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="3.149">those individuals and jumping over the</text>
  <text start="115.319" dur="3.991">border saying yes now you&amp;#39;re a US</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="4.651">citizen or you can become a u.s. citizen</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.589">put him on a bus set him to a sanctuary</text>
  <text start="121.44" dur="3.689">City and the cities we would would</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="3.36">receive funds from the federal</text>
  <text start="125.129" dur="4.14">government to house these individuals</text>
  <text start="127.259" dur="4.26">get them their working papers get them</text>
  <text start="129.269" dur="5.071">jobs and integrate them into the country</text>
  <text start="131.519" dur="6.3">now we know this had many agendas behind</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="6.539">it one was to blend all these people</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="5.761">into the US this was also happening out</text>
  <text start="140.879" dur="5.25">in Europe with the refugees and this was</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="5.1">the beginning to the beginning stage to</text>
  <text start="146.129" dur="4.951">set up the globalist agenda of making</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="6.18">everyone one and the same the other</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="4.95">agenda was to bring in low paid workers</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="3.75">because remember they were trying to</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="6.09">push the TPP through and this was going</text>
  <text start="158.61" dur="6.9">to basically bring the pay rate down to</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="5.759">the countries around the world and they</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.16">will be allowed to work here with the</text>
  <text start="167.879" dur="4.53">salary from their country because what</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="3.09">they wanted everyone what they wanted</text>
  <text start="172.409" dur="2.761">all the countries to be they wanted</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="3.75">everyone to be on a level playing field</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.28">and we can see that this is all being</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="6.059">reversed and this is going to take some</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="5.88">time but what we&amp;#39;ve learned about Obama</text>
  <text start="183.569" dur="6.901">is that he was spa</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="8.01">on a lot more individuals than we first</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="6.9">thought now back in May the Foreign</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="4.59">Intelligence Service Court FISA found</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.28">that the National Security Agency the</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="5.91">NSA under Obama routinely violated</text>
  <text start="202.65" dur="4.26">American privacy protections while</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="4.8">scouring through overseas intercepts and</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="4.56">they fail to disclose the extent of the</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="4.74">problems until the final days before</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="5.88">Trump was elected into his presidency</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="5.07">now there are new memos which were</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="4.47">obtained by the American Civil Liberties</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="6.36">Union via the Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="221.82" dur="5.25">request detailing even more violations</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="3.78">that occurred during the obama</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="5.04">administration which include everything</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="5.16">from illegally surveilling people on US</text>
  <text start="232.11" dur="5.37">soil to sharing unredacted documents</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="5.52">that included unmasked names of american</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="5.49">citizens and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="3.99">there are more and more reports coming</text>
  <text start="242.97" dur="3.39">out through the Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.67">Act and we&amp;#39;re starting to find out that</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="6.03">he was spying on a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="5.66">the FBI disclosed three instances</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="6.09">between 2013 and February 2014 of</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="6.04">improper disseminations of US persons</text>
  <text start="258.48" dur="6.75">identities so we&amp;#39;re starting to find out</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="6.63">that this problem was a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="5.79">even what Trump was telling us and this</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="5.1">is going way back in time and it looks</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.45">like we were right once again because we</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="6.18">talked about how the NSA the FBI the CIA</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="5.949">all these different agencies they were</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="5.97">spying on the people and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="5.011">what was going on and of course remember</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="4.08">when Obama came out and said oh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="4.47">going to stop this he&amp;#39;s going to rework</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="5.01">this they didn&amp;#39;t they continually went</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="5.09">on spying on the American people now</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="4.94">just the other day we talked about how</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="6.81">wasserman-schultz IT aides</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="9.15">how they were running this entire</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="8.02">network and they protected the data of</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="5.35">what was really going on in the DNC and</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="4.44">we know that the FBI has seen them</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="4.2">seized a number of smashed hard drives</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="3.45">and other computer equipment from the</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="4.47">residence of Imran</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="3.93">a 1 this was the IT aid of Debbie</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="3.84">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="5.64">and we&amp;#39;ve learned that a 1 has been</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="5.07">captured at a Dulles Airport while</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="5.58">attempting to flee the country now while</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="5.55">all of this was happening a 1 they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="4.02">been kept on the payroll of former DNC</text>
  <text start="337.17" dur="4.59">chairman debbie Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="4.8">despite a rapidly escalating scandal</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="4.14">that potentially involves multiple</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="4.05">federal crimes and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="345.9" dur="2.97">were kept on the payroll was basically</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="5.04">to keep their mouth shut</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="7.25">now there&amp;#39;s a list of about 30 other</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="6.39">Democrats that had the a wand on their</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="4.78">taxpayer-funded payroll and we have a</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="3.39">list of those individuals on the x12</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="3.3">Airport comm site or if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="3.63">YouTube you can see that list and I</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="3.99">think as time goes on and as they look</text>
  <text start="366.18" dur="3.6">at these smashed hard drives and they</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="3.36">start looking into everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="3.6">been going on there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="3.18">more evidence that it&amp;#39;s pouring out so</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="3.33">what have we learned</text>
  <text start="374.73" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve learned that yes the Obama</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="4.44">administration they&amp;#39;ve been spying on</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="4.65">many many people we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="4.74">problem with the DNC that Russian</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="5.16">hacking story well that turned out to be</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="5.04">fake phony and false because no one ever</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="5.88">allowed an investigation to take place</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="5.7">and they are hiding things and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.35" dur="4.14">starting to see that a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="4.41">starting to come out and there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="5.85">investigation going on into what is</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="5.28">happening now we see that Trump&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="4.02">communications director scar Moochie</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s out there saying listen if there</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="5.31">any leaks or anything like that I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="5.94">going to fire everybody because you know</text>
  <text start="413.67" dur="6.06">what this cannot stand</text>
  <text start="416.37" dur="6.03">now he&amp;#39;s already terminated suspected</text>
  <text start="419.73" dur="4.85">leaker Michael short because they do</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="5.91">believe that he was leaking information</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="6.37">and they&amp;#39;re looking into many others who</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="5.1">have been leaking information now since</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="4.8">Trump has been on the back of sessions</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="5.91">continually pushing pushing pushing him</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="6.65">it looks like after a week of being</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="5.46">publicly blasted by Trump session is</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="6.43">reportedly preparing to launch a series</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="6.6">of investigations into leaks and this is</text>
  <text start="448.83" dur="4.29">what Trump really wants he wants to find</text>
  <text start="451.38" dur="3.87">out who the leakers are you</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="5.88">to find out who the individuals are that</text>
  <text start="455.25" dur="6.389">unmasked certain individuals and I can</text>
  <text start="459" dur="4.29">see as we move forward that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="4.051">going to he&amp;#39;s going to continually push</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="4.14">sessions into doing more and more if you</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="4.14">notice he&amp;#39;s been talking a lot about</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="4.56">Clinton looking into the emails looking</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="4.89">into what was been going on with that</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="5.16">looking into Ukraine and he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="474.72" dur="4.979">sessions into investigating these things</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="5.489">remember Trump cannot investigate these</text>
  <text start="479.699" dur="5.521">things on his own the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="5.4">needs to do these things and it looks</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="5.509">like he&amp;#39;s nudging him to do these things</text>
  <text start="488.039" dur="4.651">and once again once this information</text>
  <text start="490.729" dur="5.021">starts coming out and once these</text>
  <text start="492.69" dur="5.97">investigations go into overdrive well</text>
  <text start="495.75" dur="5.25">things are about to change hopefully we</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="4.56">can get that far unless the deep state</text>
  <text start="501" dur="5.16">comes up with something else because we</text>
  <text start="503.22" dur="5.04">can see right now they are really boxing</text>
  <text start="506.16" dur="3.36">in Trump right now now remember the US</text>
  <text start="508.26" dur="3.75">House of Representatives</text>
  <text start="509.52" dur="6">they voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="5.279">slap new sanctions on Russia now you</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="4.259">need to remember what is going on here</text>
  <text start="517.289" dur="5.31">and Paul Craig Roberts he really sums</text>
  <text start="519.779" dur="6.18">this up very nicely because what there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="5.581">what he&amp;#39;s saying is that Congress</text>
  <text start="525.959" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re pushing this bill for more</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="4.95">sanctions and it removes the power of</text>
  <text start="531" dur="5.43">the President to rescind the sanctions</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="4.44">that Obama imposed basically what</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re putting Trump</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="4.139">in a box if Trump vetoes this</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="5.76">encroachment on presidential power</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="6.361">Congress and the media will present the</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="4.71">video the veto as an absolute proof that</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="4.95">Trump is a Russian agent and is</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="5.4">protecting Russia with his veto if Trump</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="5.069">does not veto the bill Trump will have</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="4.08">thrown his hand and accepted that he</text>
  <text start="558.089" dur="4.491">cannot reduce the dangerous tensions</text>
  <text start="559.74" dur="5.67">with Russia in other words the bill is a</text>
  <text start="562.58" dur="4.81">lose-lose for Trump maybe he will think</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="4.86">of a way of getting out of this now if</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="3.86">we break this down think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.27" dur="5.4">happening here</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="7.18">the legislation basically interferes</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="4.77">with the constitutionality derived by</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="3.96">the executive power the current</text>
  <text start="580.44" dur="4.32">legislation seeks not only to impose</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="4.57">sanctions that have been proposed by</text>
  <text start="584.76" dur="3.55">Congress rather than the executive but</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="4.59">the bill would force trump and</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="6.18">ostensibly any successor in the White</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="5.13">House to go through Congress in order to</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="4.29">repeal the sanctions now because the</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="4.02">bill will involve Russian sanctions of</text>
  <text start="598.78" dur="4.29">course Trump has a very difficult</text>
  <text start="600.7" dur="4.98">situation because if he goes ahead and</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="4.83">he vetoes this bill well guess what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="4.68">going to have to take the heat and that</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="7.17">corporate media is going to be all over</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="7.88">him now if he does go ahead with these</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="6.45">sanctions Europe has already said listen</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="5.71">we don&amp;#39;t want these sanctions and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.52" dur="6.21">going to retaliate so he&amp;#39;s going to lose</text>
  <text start="623.95" dur="6.48">Europe think about businesses in the</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="5.64">United States this hurts many many</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="5.16">businesses and jobs around the world and</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="4.41">if these sanctions go forward well</text>
  <text start="635.59" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s certain companies like BP Exxon</text>
  <text start="637.78" dur="4.37">Mobil General Electric Boeing Citigroup</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="5.37">MasterCard Dow Chemical Ford</text>
  <text start="642.15" dur="4.96">International Paper and many others are</text>
  <text start="645.58" dur="3.63">saying that this is going to hurt their</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="5.25">business and this is going to be tough</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="6.3">on Trump so he has a very big decision</text>
  <text start="652.36" dur="5.28">coming up and he has he has to look at</text>
  <text start="655.51" dur="4.05">both sides here and I think taking the</text>
  <text start="657.64" dur="5.54">heat from the corporate media is his</text>
  <text start="659.56" dur="6.78">best choice at this point because again</text>
  <text start="663.18" dur="5.89">Russia has done nothing wrong there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="666.34" dur="6.15">reason to sanction Russia and this is</text>
  <text start="669.07" dur="6.12">part of the old regime where Russia is</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="4.65">the bad guy and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="5.25">see how this whole thing plays out now</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="7.71">we understand that the deep state the</text>

  <text start="782.8" dur="7.17">to launch an ICBM maybe tonight and</text>
  <text start="786.69" dur="4.24">again they can launch a missile the</text>
  <text start="789.97" dur="3.12">first of all they don&amp;#39;t even know if</text>
  <text start="790.93" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s an ICBM the last missile launch was</text>
  <text start="793.09" dur="3.93">not an ICBM of course the corporate</text>

  <text start="797.02" dur="3.87">months down the line they&amp;#39;ll correct it</text>
  <text start="798.76" dur="4.74">and say yeah we figured out there what</text>
  <text start="800.89" dur="5.43">it wasn&amp;#39;t an ICBM but we know from</text>
  <text start="803.5" dur="5.16">Russia we know from the South Korean</text>

  <text start="812.35" dur="7.65">an ICBM I don&amp;#39;t think North Korea has</text>

  <text start="820" dur="4.77">missile system yes I think they do have</text>
  <text start="821.73" dur="5.11">medium-range missiles but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="824.77" dur="4.86">they are there yet they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="826.84" dur="4.89">play this up and bring this to the next</text>

  <text start="1044.62" dur="6.48">from al Qaeda al sham al nusra we need</text>
  <text start="1048.339" dur="5.281">to see a separation because basically</text>
  <text start="1051.1" dur="5.91">what&amp;#39;s happening here is that Syria and</text>
  <text start="1053.62" dur="6.02">Russia they are going into this area and</text>
  <text start="1057.01" dur="6.54">if they do not separate themselves</text>
  <text start="1059.64" dur="7.24">everyone is up for an attack so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1063.55" dur="5.4">about 9,000 militants that are in this</text>

  <text start="1068.95" dur="4.859">separating themselves of who is moderate</text>
  <text start="1071.2" dur="3.69">rebel and who are the terrorists now</text>
  <text start="1073.809" dur="4.111">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how this</text>
  <text start="1074.89" dur="4.56">plays out because once again we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1077.92" dur="3.48">to see how they separate themselves</text>
  <text start="1079.45" dur="3.6">because really they&amp;#39;re one in the same</text>
  <text start="1081.4" dur="4.11">now are they all going to say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1083.05" dur="4.59">moderate rebels are they going to really</text>
  <text start="1085.51" dur="4.14">split themselves into two I think</text>
  <text start="1087.64" dur="4.77">Syria and Russia are just going to go in</text>
  <text start="1089.65" dur="5.01">there and clean house and get rid of all</text>
  <text start="1092.41" dur="6.12">these terrorist groups they already know</text>
  <text start="1094.66" dur="6.78">that these groups are one in the same</text>
  <text start="1098.53" dur="4.77">and of course they&amp;#39;re giving this</text>
  <text start="1101.44" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re giving them this warning first</text>
  <text start="1103.3" dur="3.84">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1105.25" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re going to come in and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1107.14" dur="4.2">going to push through and take back the</text>
  <text start="1108.94" dur="4.56">entire area and we can see why the</text>
  <text start="1111.34" dur="5.16">Western media was coming up with this</text>
  <text start="1113.5" dur="6.179">fake news about them you know firing</text>
  <text start="1116.5" dur="3.99">into this safe zone area because they</text>
  <text start="1119.679" dur="3.061">can see</text>
  <text start="1120.49" dur="4.05">what is about to happen they&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="1122.74" dur="4.2">go into this area and this is why</text>
  <text start="1124.54" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the idea that this</text>
  <text start="1126.94" dur="4.739">is happening now the target the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1129.37" dur="3.9">Tiger forces they&amp;#39;re plowing through the</text>
  <text start="1131.679" dur="4.231">Islamic state through southern Raqqa</text>
  <text start="1133.27" dur="5.7">they liberated several strategic sites</text>
  <text start="1135.91" dur="6.03">and there&amp;#39;s continually moving eastward</text>
  <text start="1138.97" dur="5.16">in Syria right now and we can see at</text>
  <text start="1141.94" dur="4.739">this point that we are coming up to a</text>
  <text start="1144.13" dur="5.07">crossroads especially with Trump because</text>
  <text start="1146.679" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s going to have to decide what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1149.2" dur="5.609">going to do because at this point he</text>
  <text start="1152.559" dur="3.781">might as well say listen I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1154.809" dur="3.331">have to take the heat we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1156.34" dur="3.54">have to go after the leakers the unmask</text>
  <text start="1158.14" dur="3.96">kurz we&amp;#39;re going to have to stop the</text>
  <text start="1159.88" dur="4.74">wars in the Middle East and we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1162.1" dur="5.7">play sanctions on Russia because he has</text>
  <text start="1164.62" dur="5.79">this huge decision so what path is he</text>
  <text start="1167.8" dur="5.37">going to take because he can take the</text>
  <text start="1170.41" dur="4.98">path that leads down the road with the</text>
  <text start="1173.17" dur="4.77">neocons with the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="1175.39" dur="4.8">central bankers or he can take the path</text>
  <text start="1177.94" dur="4.14">to say okay we&amp;#39;re not going to send</text>
  <text start="1180.19" dur="4.94">troops so far he hasn&amp;#39;t sent any troops</text>
  <text start="1182.08" dur="4.86">to Afghanistan he wants to have a</text>
  <text start="1185.13" dur="3.76">meeting he wants to have an</text>
  <text start="1186.94" dur="5.25">investigation of what we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="1188.89" dur="5.73">in Afghanistan for 17 years the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1192.19" dur="4.98">opposition they&amp;#39;re not receiving funding</text>
  <text start="1194.62" dur="5.58">any more and he&amp;#39;s going to have to make</text>
  <text start="1197.17" dur="4.889">major major decisions coming up very</text>
  <text start="1200.2" dur="3.72">soon and I think he&amp;#39;s reaching the point</text>
  <text start="1202.059" dur="4.5">right now where he&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="1203.92" dur="4.95">decide which path he&amp;#39;s going to go down</text>
  <text start="1206.559" dur="5.401">because he can&amp;#39;t play both sides anymore</text>
  <text start="1208.87" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s time to take off the gloves and</text>
  <text start="1211.96" dur="4.23">make a decision of what you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1214.24" dur="5.49">do are you going to go and say listen</text>
  <text start="1216.19" dur="5.31">Russia they are our allies we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1219.73" dur="3.48">doing sanctions we&amp;#39;re not following</text>
  <text start="1221.5" dur="4.07">through on this we&amp;#39;re starting the</text>
  <text start="1223.21" dur="4.83">investigation into all of these things</text>
  <text start="1225.57" dur="4.63">sessions as he continually nudges him to</text>
  <text start="1228.04" dur="4.32">do this we can see he&amp;#39;s trying to push</text>
  <text start="1230.2" dur="3.42">down this way and I think at this point</text>
  <text start="1232.36" dur="2.67">in time no matter what the corporate</text>
  <text start="1233.62" dur="3.87">media says no matter what the deep stay</text>
  <text start="1235.03" dur="5.1">says we need to head down this path</text>
  <text start="1237.49" dur="4.41">where it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what they say it</text>
  <text start="1240.13" dur="4.95">doesn&amp;#39;t matter about Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="1241.9" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s about bringing world peace it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1245.08" dur="4.74">about bringing us through this</text>
  <text start="1246.88" dur="5.16">transition it&amp;#39;s about bringing us to the</text>
  <text start="1249.82" dur="4.709">other side it&amp;#39;s about bringing</text>
  <text start="1252.04" dur="5.879">manufacturing back to the United States</text>
  <text start="1254.529" dur="6.301">so let&amp;#39;s see which path he brings us</text>
  <text start="1257.919" dur="5.941">down because he has decisions to make</text>
  <text start="1260.83" dur="4.5">and it all depends on his decisions now</text>
  <text start="1263.86" dur="3.169">he could bring us down the path of the</text>
  <text start="1265.33" dur="4.439">deep state he might still go with</text>
  <text start="1267.029" dur="6.01">Russian sanctions and this is not going</text>
  <text start="1269.769" dur="5.731">to help the situation whatsoever I think</text>
  <text start="1273.039" dur="6.561">he should just bite the bullet and say</text>
  <text start="1275.5" dur="6.509">listen no sanctions we&amp;#39;re investigating</text>
  <text start="1279.6" dur="4.569">everyone better start hiding because</text>
  <text start="1282.009" dur="3.9">here we come</text>
