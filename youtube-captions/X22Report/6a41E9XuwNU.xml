  <text start="65.28" dur="5.15">episode is the entire economic system is</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="4.8">based on an illusion which will shatter</text>
  <text start="70.43" dur="5.38">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="6.86">financial news now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="6.449">illusion is continuing and we can see</text>
  <text start="79.58" dur="4.96">they&amp;#39;re not letting up they want</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="5.22">everyone to believe and Trump is out</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="6.439">there and he is telling everyone look at</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="7.101">all these jobs that we are creating and</text>
  <text start="90.979" dur="6.611">he&amp;#39;s saying that this is fantastic now</text>
  <text start="94.58" dur="5.829">once again this is part of the old</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="5.55">system nothing has really changed he</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="5.46">didn&amp;#39;t bring any jobs back into the</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="6.149">United States he didn&amp;#39;t create these</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="6.301">incredible manufacturing jobs what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.289" dur="4.951">doing right now is he&amp;#39;s playing into</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="3.449">what they&amp;#39;ve been pushing all along</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="5.61">think about it</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="7.201">what policies has he put forth to make</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="5.04">all of this happen nothing so what does</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="5.009">he have to do he has to take what was</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="5.069">there and say yes this is working</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="3.991">because this is what they&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="4.831">all along now let&amp;#39;s take a look at these</text>
  <text start="131.82" dur="4.77">job numbers that the new corporate media</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="3.75">is out there telling us how great they</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="3.929">are Trump is out there telling us how</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="4.31">great they are telling us that the</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="5.791">economy is at full strength</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="5.109">now the BLS reported that in July us</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="3.989">added about two hundred nine thousand</text>
  <text start="147.959" dur="6.03">jobs now that beat the consensus</text>
  <text start="150.299" dur="8.131">expectations of around 180 thousand now</text>
  <text start="153.989" dur="7.411">June was revised higher to 231 from two</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="7.679">hundred and twenty two thousand even as</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="6">May was revised lower from 152 to 145 so</text>
  <text start="166.109" dur="4.38">there was a net gain of about two</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="8.3">thousand in the prior two months now</text>
  <text start="170.489" dur="10.53">when we look at the jobs what jobs are</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="7.75">being added well bars restaurants while</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="6.041">they hired the most workers of any</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="6.13">sector in July now keep in mind</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="6.78">that the July gain was all in the</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="8.879">seasonal adjustment factor unadjusted</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="6.27">jobs declined by 1.30 8 million now the</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="3.451">unemployment rate dropped from four</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="5.7">point four percent to four point three</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="8.159">percent we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="9.81">here in the United States does this look</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="11.131">like a country that is fully employed no</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="8.25">it doesn&amp;#39;t why would retail be crumbling</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.84">apart it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense why would</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="8.21">the housing market be stalling right now</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="8.14">why aren&amp;#39;t corporations making the sales</text>
  <text start="232.08" dur="8.64">why are there so many people out of the</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="8.279">labor force market I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="6.01">the whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="5.011">the participation rate it rose from</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="3.89">sixty two point eight percent to 62</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.43">point nine percent so that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="5.77">meaningless at this point and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="6.24">seeing is that these jobs that are being</text>
  <text start="256.39" dur="6.72">created there the low-level jobs now</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="5.25">think back when Obama was bringing in</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="3.36">all these illegal immigrants and they</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="4.8">wanted to bring in a lot of these</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="6.15">refugees now to boost GDP and to make</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.92">sure that the economy continually</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="3.6">operates what and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="275.11" dur="2.58">agenda why they were bringing in</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="6.35">illegals and why they were bringing in</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="9.24">refugees they needed individuals to fill</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="7.63">the low level paying jobs and this is</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="5.4">exactly what they have done because most</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="5.279">Americans were looking for a higher</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="6.149">paying job because most of the people</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="5.821">could not survive because they set their</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="6.06">homes their cars and everything else</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="5.01">they were set at a different level when</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="4.291">they lost their jobs and they were</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="4.56">taking these part-time jobs maybe they</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="5.13">have two part-time jobs there were a lot</text>
  <text start="310.87" dur="6.51">of low low level jobs that no one was</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="5.579">filling to keep GDP up and to keep the</text>
  <text start="317.38" dur="3.39">job rate looking good they needed to</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="2.731">fill these this way</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="3.959">can manipulate the numbers a lot better</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="5.1">now the gap between the unemployment</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="8.43">rate and the unemployment to population</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="7.769">ratio remains very very wide now digging</text>
  <text start="333.159" dur="4.921">through the numbers reveal some</text>
  <text start="335.139" dur="5.49">troubling features the household survey</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="4.44">reported that an impressive 345 thousand</text>
  <text start="340.629" dur="4.561">jobs were added more than 50 percent</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="4.95">higher than the establishment survey now</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="4.71">the bulk of these jobs like we said</text>
  <text start="347.47" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re part-time now according to the</text>
  <text start="349.9" dur="6.079">BLS in July three hundred ninety three</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="7.289">thousand part-time jobs were added</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="8.59">54,000 full-time jobs were added that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.979" dur="6.41">it so we have a major problem here so</text>
  <text start="364.569" dur="4.861">this was the biggest increase in</text>
  <text start="366.389" dur="7">part-time jobs going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="369.43" dur="6.66">September of 2016 now where the jobs we</text>
  <text start="373.389" dur="5.31">said before they are in food services</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="3.87">drinking plates places waiters and</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="1.801">bartenders that&amp;#39;s where they are right</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="3.09">now</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="4.77">even though the restaurant Performance</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="4.5">Index is continually dropping remember a</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="4.56">lot of these individuals they can hire</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="4.14">them they get paid very minute they get</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="3.269">minimum wage here they make a lot of</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="4.44">their money on tips so it doesn&amp;#39;t cost</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="5.731">the restaurants that much so now there</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="4.92">have been 89 consecutive months without</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="5.13">a decline for waiter and bartender jobs</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="5.76">now these jobs fall in the category of</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="5.67">leisure hospitality and that sector pays</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="6.329">the worst wages an average of around $13</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="7.68">and 35 dollars 35 cents an hour which is</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="6.241">around 331 dollars a week now if we look</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="4.28">at the professional and business</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="4.95">services that added around 49,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="5.079">within this category administrative and</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.91">waste services added around 30,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="7.261">temp workers added 14,000 jobs almost</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="6.75">15,000 actually healthcare added 39,000</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="6.87">with job gains occurring in ambulatory</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="6.87">health care services in the hospitals</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="6.06">and once again they&amp;#39;re low-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="6.649">so what we have right here is two things</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="6.69">happening we have students who are</text>
  <text start="450.509" dur="4.06">graduating high school then going to</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="4.229">college</text>
  <text start="454.569" dur="6.09">and this huge gigantic student loans</text>
  <text start="457.779" dur="4.86">that they need to pay back and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.659" dur="3.78">looking for this full-time job and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="4.74">just not out there because only 54,000</text>
  <text start="464.439" dur="6.18">well only that number was filled the</text>
  <text start="467.379" dur="7.171">rest were part-time jobs and when we</text>
  <text start="470.619" dur="8.04">look at the education level of jobs</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="8.369">being filled right now guess what it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="8.55">high school diploma or lower the college</text>
  <text start="482.919" dur="6.75">graduate right now they cannot find work</text>
  <text start="487.209" dur="5.73">out in the workplace they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="489.669" dur="5.52">that full-time job where they can go</text>
  <text start="492.939" dur="3.93">make what they need to make to pay back</text>
  <text start="495.189" dur="3.51">their student loan al-ahli these</text>
  <text start="496.869" dur="3.931">individuals are trying to find a</text>
  <text start="498.699" dur="3.42">part-time job but it&amp;#39;s very difficult</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="3.269">because a lot of the employers say</text>
  <text start="502.119" dur="4.53">listen if I give you this part-time job</text>
  <text start="504.069" dur="5.1">I know once a full-time job comes by</text>
  <text start="506.649" dur="5.16">guess what you&amp;#39;re going to leave and</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="6.84">this is why they look for others who</text>
  <text start="511.809" dur="6.66">might not been a graduate they might not</text>
  <text start="516.009" dur="4.08">have a college degree might be an</text>
  <text start="518.469" dur="3.54">illegal immigrant because they know that</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep those jobs it might</text>
  <text start="522.009" dur="5.551">be a refugee and from the statistics we</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="6.48">can see the jobs that have been filled</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="7.019">well it&amp;#39;s on the lower level so we can</text>
  <text start="531.759" dur="7.08">see right now these job numbers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.579" dur="8.521">just keeping the illusion alive and this</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="6.961">country cannot survive on a workforce</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="6.95">that is working as a part under a</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="8.459">waitress working in the leisure or</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="6.93">hospitality industry it just will not</text>
  <text start="554.259" dur="4.94">work if we&amp;#39;re not filling these</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="6.339">manufacturing jobs and building up the</text>
  <text start="559.199" dur="8.38">manufacturing companies and building</text>
  <text start="563.319" dur="6.931">more things the country will not be able</text>
  <text start="567.579" dur="6.271">to survive right now and it looks like</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.61">at this point that we&amp;#39;re still doing the</text>
  <text start="573.85" dur="5.219">same thing nothing&amp;#39;s really changed in</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="6.75">the economy there&amp;#39;s no new economic</text>
  <text start="579.069" dur="6.361">policy the debts still rising we have</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="5.85">the same exact problems Obamacare still</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="6.99">enforced this is still</text>
  <text start="588.46" dur="7.86">this economy still under what Obama the</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="6.81">Fed has started it has not changed this</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="5.85">needs to run its course just like the</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="7.26">stock market because how else do you</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="5.75">prove to everyone that the way this</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="3.51">system is working right now with</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="3.46">quantitative easing with all the</text>
  <text start="610" dur="5.25">stimulus and everything like that you</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="8.6">need to show everyone this approach does</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="8.25">not work and you need to let this system</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="8.44">implode on itself it&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s compare it</text>
  <text start="623.5" dur="6.54">Oh BOM AX started Obama care this</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="5.91">incredible health insurance that</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="8.58">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna love how else do you</text>
  <text start="634.33" dur="5.88">show everyone that it doesn&amp;#39;t work yes</text>
  <text start="638.62" dur="3.39">you can try repealing it but that</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="3.78">doesn&amp;#39;t show how it doesn&amp;#39;t work you</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="4.92">know what you let it do you let it</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="8.22">destroy itself and you can turn around</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.14">and say listen you gave us this you told</text>
  <text start="652.21" dur="4.62">us it was going to be incredible we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="5.04">had half of the co-op&amp;#39;s the exchanges go</text>
  <text start="656.83" dur="4.14">bankrupt we spent billions of dollars we</text>
  <text start="659.11" dur="5.37">spent hundreds of million dollars on a</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="7.65">website that didn&amp;#39;t even work premiums</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="5.88">were rising like crazy and now nobody</text>
  <text start="668.62" dur="4.53">has health insurance it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="670.36" dur="5.88">disaster who do we blame it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="673.15" dur="4.65">you blame those individuals who created</text>
  <text start="676.24" dur="3.75">it who said it was gonna be the best</text>
  <text start="677.8" dur="4.26">thing and this is what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="679.99" dur="5.13">the economy right now the only way to</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="4.98">show everyone that this economy the way</text>
  <text start="685.12" dur="5.13">it was set up what the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="687.04" dur="5.67">doing what Obama did what the deep state</text>
  <text start="690.25" dur="3.84">did is to let it implode and the only</text>
  <text start="692.71" dur="3.15">way to do this is to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="694.09" dur="4.53">alive and this is what is being done</text>
  <text start="695.86" dur="4.77">right now now the central bankers</text>
  <text start="698.62" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re out there and they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.63" dur="5.88">figure out you know why inflation is not</text>
  <text start="703.78" dur="5.63">hitting because global inflation right</text>
  <text start="706.51" dur="5.04">now has hit the lowest level since 2009</text>
  <text start="709.41" dur="5.23">now the Organisation for Economic</text>
  <text start="711.55" dur="5.49">Cooperation and Development said that</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="3.75">consumer prices across the g20 the</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="4.05">countries that account for most of the</text>
  <text start="718.39" dur="3.84">world&amp;#39;s economic activity they were 2</text>
  <text start="721.09" dur="4.41">percent higher than</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="7.59">year earlier now the last time inflation</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="6.84">was lower was in October of 2009 when it</text>
  <text start="729.82" dur="4.62">stood at around 1.7 percent so the</text>
  <text start="732.34" dur="5.16">central banks they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="6">that they can&amp;#39;t figure out you know how</text>
  <text start="737.5" dur="6.84">this occurred why inflation is not</text>

  <text start="887.269" dur="6.36">to talk about how the stimulus is coming</text>
  <text start="890.269" dur="5.67">to an end and the new term that their</text>
  <text start="893.629" dur="5.01">phrasing right now is quantitative</text>
  <text start="895.939" dur="6">failure so we had quantitative easing</text>
  <text start="898.639" dur="6.98">and they&amp;#39;re saying because of that we</text>
  <text start="901.939" dur="5.88">might have quantitative failure where</text>
  <text start="905.619" dur="5.051">everything that the Fed has done over</text>
  <text start="907.819" dur="6.57">the many many years it might just end up</text>

  <text start="930.889" dur="3.601">what&amp;#39;s happening right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="932.089" dur="5.19">starting to realize well maybe things</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="3.899">aren&amp;#39;t as good as they are now we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1057.26" dur="3.72">going to be in many different stages</text>
  <text start="1058.34" dur="4.2">where when it first starts out just like</text>
  <text start="1060.98" dur="2.79">in every other country and the dollar</text>
  <text start="1062.54" dur="3.78">starts collapsing and we start seeing</text>
  <text start="1063.77" dur="4.56">inflation people are gonna do the first</text>
  <text start="1066.32" dur="4.02">thing that everyone does they try to get</text>
  <text start="1068.33" dur="3.57">as much as they possibly can and get rid</text>
  <text start="1070.34" dur="3.48">of those dollars that are falling in</text>

  <text start="1073.82" dur="3.15">try to buy up as much as they want that</text>
  <text start="1075.35" dur="4.02">this happened in Venezuela this happened</text>

  <text start="1086.09" dur="4.53">happened to the in the Soviet Union once</text>
  <text start="1088.49" dur="4.41">the shelves are cleared out supplies</text>
  <text start="1090.62" dur="3.9">well they&amp;#39;re gonna trickle in because</text>
