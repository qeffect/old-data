  <text start="62.59" dur="4.77">the plot of the episode is China&amp;#39;s belt</text>
  <text start="65.23" dur="5.79">and Road will push the petrodollar to</text>
  <text start="67.36" dur="6.3">its doom let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.02" dur="5.31">collapse financial news now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="73.66" dur="6.69">soft data that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing well</text>
  <text start="76.33" dur="6.87">it&amp;#39;s not living up to what the hard data</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="6.39">is reporting and what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="83.2" dur="7.02">right now is that the economy well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.74" dur="5.76">declining rapidly and we know prior to</text>
  <text start="90.22" dur="5.28">the elections the economy has been</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="5.94">propped up during the elections propped</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="5.28">up right after the elections still the</text>
  <text start="98.44" dur="3.83">same propping up what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="100.78" dur="3.87">now is things are starting to do</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="4.989">deteriorate right now and things are</text>
  <text start="104.65" dur="5.19">actually getting worse when we look at</text>
  <text start="107.259" dur="6.151">the Empire Fed Manufacturing survey well</text>
  <text start="109.84" dur="6.57">that has crashed back to negative one</text>
  <text start="113.41" dur="7.08">and we see that this is the worst and</text>
  <text start="116.41" dur="6.959">first contractionary print since October</text>
  <text start="120.49" dur="6.269">2016 and we see new orders are crashing</text>
  <text start="123.369" dur="6.42">and we can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="126.759" dur="7.861">changing right now now what is changing</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="8.341">here is that business investment into</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="6.51">the economy it&amp;#39;s not happening the US</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="4.86">economy is suffering from a major long</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.77">term problem and this has been going on</text>
  <text start="142.99" dur="6.84">for quite a while going all the way back</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="6.54">to 2000 or so and it got worse when we</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="4.41">hit the Great Recession never really</text>
  <text start="152.44" dur="4.65">recovered and we&amp;#39;ve been on this</text>
  <text start="154.24" dur="6.3">downward slide net private domestic</text>
  <text start="157.09" dur="5.81">business investment is relatively weak</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="5.88">and has been on a downward course since</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="6.699">2000 and this is ever since the dot-com</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="5.76">bubble now private investment has been</text>
  <text start="169.599" dur="6.091">in the tank right now so the question is</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="7.11">why is private investment so important</text>
  <text start="175.69" dur="6.03">well it fuels productivity was little</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="5.04">fuel we&amp;#39;re going to we should expect</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.92">weak productivity numbers in the US and</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="7.02">so we are seeing that the growth in</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="5.7">productivity is very weak and has been</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="5.22">trending downward since the dot-com</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="4.62">bubble the u.s. is in the grips of the</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="6.09">longest slide in productivity growth</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="7.14">since the late 1970s and this is very</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="7.11">alarming because productivity is the key</text>
  <text start="208.27" dur="8.49">ingredient in determining wages prices</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="8.49">and the economic output now to put all</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="6.96">this in context there&amp;#39;s only been one</text>
  <text start="220.57" dur="8.94">post recession recovery since 1870 as</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="9.33">weak as the current one and that one was</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="7.32">following the Great Depression so think</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="10.73">about what is happening right now we are</text>
  <text start="236.83" dur="10.61">in a weak productivity growth that is</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="8.2">like the Great Depression that is</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="7.21">unbelievably bad and if you look you can</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="6.99">see that productivity has gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="6.47">since the Great Recession of 2008 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="6.47">actually absolutely terrible</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="6.58">now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about NAFTA in</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.63">the last couple of reports and we know</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="4.98">that Trump is looking to renegotiate</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="4.68">during his campaign yes he said he was</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="3.54">going to get rid of it and we know</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="3.81">through Congress there&amp;#39;s a lot of laws</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="3.81">that are intertwined in it and he just</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="3.63">can&amp;#39;t write an executive order because</text>
  <text start="280.03" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s going to have to go to Congress to</text>
  <text start="282.19" dur="4.979">get rid of NAFTA completely yes it would</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="5.4">be great if he could do that will he do</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="6.091">that maybe but he&amp;#39;s been trying to get</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="6.3">the final approval for Robert with</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="4.86">Pfizer and this is his nominee for the</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="5.93">United States Trade Representative and</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="8.67">he needed this individual to negotiate</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="8.44">NAFTA well finally the Senate after four</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="9.3">months have finally said okay he&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="7.11">to go and now the negotiations the</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="3.66">renegotiations I should say for NAFTA</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="2.23">can begin now the first thing he has to</text>
  <text start="319.75" dur="3.01">do</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="6.06">is he asked to notify Congress of his</text>
  <text start="322.76" dur="5.61">intentions to renegotiate NAFTA and this</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="3.69">will trigger a 90-day waiting period so</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="3.54">here&amp;#39;s the wait about a hundred days or</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="4.769">so before you can go ahead and do this</text>
  <text start="331.91" dur="4.47">now the question is what is even going</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="3.931">to do with NAFTA is you really going to</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="4.05">read negotiate it like he says and if he</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="3.659">doesn&amp;#39;t get what he wants is he going to</text>
  <text start="340.43" dur="6.18">scrap it then again he has to go to</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="7.741">Congress to unwind all the laws that</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="5.49">were intertwined in turn after now I</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="4.37">think he needs to renegotiate NAFTA</text>
  <text start="352.1" dur="5.73">right now because like we&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="354.34" dur="5.5">trade is going to be very important for</text>
  <text start="357.83" dur="4.2">after the collapse the dollar will no</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="4.59">longer be the reserve currency the petro</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="5.25">dollar will no longer exist countries</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="5.07">will be selling their oil using maybe</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="4.44">the you want maybe the ruble maybe gold</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="3.87">maybe their own currency but they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="3.48">be using the dollar which means</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="3.51">countries will not have to keep their</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="4.26">dollars in reserves if they don&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="376.88" dur="5.46">them in reserves well they come back to</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="5.82">United States and here in the United</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="4.38">States we see inflation now if know at</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="4.02">the point where the entire economy</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="4.56">collapses and there is no petrodollar</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="4.2">well guess what they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="3.84">receive dollars anymore and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="5.479">going to give us products so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="7.35">to have to have some type of trade and</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="5.321">this I do believe is what he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="402.47" dur="4.259">work out right now now the globalists on</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="5.369">the other hand they don&amp;#39;t want this this</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="6.421">is not part of their system their system</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="5.071">is to control and all these countries</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="6.57">give everything&amp;#39;s United States it</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="6.81">worked well in the beginning and here we</text>
  <text start="419.72" dur="4.5">are at the end of this system and the</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="3.96">whole thing is not working well anymore</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="4.73">this is why they were trying to push the</text>
  <text start="425.51" dur="7.86">TPP now again who does it work well for</text>
  <text start="428.95" dur="6.189">it works well for the 1% not the rest of</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="4.44">the country because as we can say the</text>
  <text start="435.139" dur="3.811">rest of the country is hurting and then</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.02">we have different levels we see the</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="5.01">middle class basically it&amp;#39;s gone and if</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="4.23">this system kept on going like it is</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="3.15">like they want to keep it going where</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="3.3">they want to keep the dollar as a</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.71">reserve currency continually put out put</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="4.02">more and more debt out into the entire</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="4.95">global arena</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="7.23">huh well those people who are not in the</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="5.7">1% who are not in the inside they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="4.62">going to find it harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="6.42">exist the value of the dollar will</text>
  <text start="465.23" dur="6.18">continually decrease and it will make it</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="3.57">very very difficult to survive every</text>
  <text start="471.41" dur="3.15">single day because what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="3.72">happen is more and more manufacturers</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="3.93">will leave there&amp;#39;ll be more and more</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="3.87">part-time work where people will not be</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="3.27">able to find full-time they&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="3.63">try to look for part-time but the</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="3.18">problem is that there&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="3.06">difficult time trying to find the</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="3.69">part-time jobs because a lot of retail</text>
  <text start="486.74" dur="3.63">is closing because there&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="4.35">people making enough money to purchase</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="5.52">things in retail so we have this entire</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="6.06">cycle where it is going nowhere and this</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="5.64">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now we</text>
  <text start="499.04" dur="5.01">are getting a lot of indicators showing</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="6.15">us that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="504.05" dur="7.38">we mentioned Cities surprise index and</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="6.72">that has dropped considerably morgan</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="6.03">stanley has their macro indicator and it</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="5.819">has just crashed the most since 2008 and</text>
  <text start="517.46" dur="5.459">when we look at this we can see that all</text>
  <text start="520.219" dur="4.591">these indicators and all these hard</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="4.801">economic data points they are all</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="4.71">showing the same thing we have a major</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="4.65">major problem heading in our direction</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="4.62">and this is not going to end well now</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this and</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="6.63">we talked about this in length in other</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="5.49">reports where Trump and his</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="3.12">administration and those individuals</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="4.08">that are trying to change things and we</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="4.32">have the central bank the neocons a deep</text>
  <text start="546.23" dur="4.47">state where they want to keep the system</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="5.52">the way it is and just basically enslave</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="4.41">more people we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="3.36">deep state the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="6.21">getting nervous and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="557.09" dur="7.25">point out that if Trump continually does</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="7.41">what he&amp;#39;s doing right now it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="564.34" dur="6.31">put the economy on the path to ruin now</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="4.44">I find this very interesting because we</text>
  <text start="570.65" dur="4.32">talked about this in length where this</text>
  <text start="573.17" dur="3.51">is exactly what Trump is trying to do</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s trying to destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="5.42">because this economy is the central bank</text>
  <text start="579.65" dur="5.52">economy it&amp;#39;s the globalist economy and</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="4.719">there&amp;#39;s no way you can fix it you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="4.559">create jobs</text>
  <text start="586.819" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t bring back manufacturing you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="589.729" dur="5.52">reduce the debt you can&amp;#39;t reduce the</text>
  <text start="592.129" dur="5.82">entitlements you can&amp;#39;t change the</text>
  <text start="595.249" dur="4.32">government right now you can&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="597.949" dur="4.5">all those individuals that have been</text>
  <text start="599.569" dur="6.48">bought off it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="602.449" dur="6.54">the only thing you can do is reset it is</text>
  <text start="606.049" dur="4.74">default on it and start from scratch</text>
  <text start="608.989" dur="3.81">and then go ahead and get rid of those</text>
  <text start="610.789" dur="5.431">individuals that we really don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="612.799" dur="6">anymore but Paul Krugman is out there</text>
  <text start="616.22" dur="5.519">and he is saying that Trump is putting</text>
  <text start="618.799" dur="5.01">us on the path to economic ruin so the</text>
  <text start="621.739" dur="6.15">globalist the central bankers they see</text>
  <text start="623.809" dur="6.98">what he&amp;#39;s doing and they understand what</text>
  <text start="627.889" dur="7.38">he is doing this is why there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="630.789" dur="6.82">between the central bank and the Trump</text>
  <text start="635.269" dur="4.35">Organization now I&amp;#39;m not saying Trump is</text>
  <text start="637.609" dur="4.051">perfect I&amp;#39;m not saying he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="639.619" dur="6">everything right I&amp;#39;m not saying he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="6.119">savior a god he&amp;#39;s a man there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.619" dur="4.981">individuals that are trying to do the</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="4.62">right thing they have a plan so does the</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="4.439">central bankers does it mean their plan</text>
  <text start="652.399" dur="4.89">is going to work no we don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="655.039" dur="5.04">this is going to work out the only thing</text>
  <text start="657.289" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s constant in all of this is that</text>
  <text start="660.079" dur="3.96">the system is going to crash that is a</text>
  <text start="663.259" dur="4.08">fact</text>
  <text start="664.039" dur="6.69">the system the way it is is going to</text>
  <text start="667.339" dur="7.89">implode on itself it all depends on who</text>
  <text start="670.729" dur="8.43">does it and we can see this is where the</text>
  <text start="675.229" dur="5.91">battle is now we see that China Russia</text>
  <text start="679.159" dur="4.561">and other countries well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="681.139" dur="6.3">preparing for this collapse they know</text>
  <text start="683.72" dur="5.009">what&amp;#39;s going on they realize that this</text>
  <text start="687.439" dur="3">systems coming down even though</text>
  <text start="688.729" dur="3.81">Americans here in the United States and</text>

  <text start="699.079" dur="3.9">point in time they don&amp;#39;t see that this</text>
  <text start="701.539" dur="4.26">whole system is going to implode on</text>
  <text start="702.979" dur="5.13">itself but those in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="705.799" dur="4.89">the deep state the central bank they</text>
  <text start="708.109" dur="4.861">realize what China&amp;#39;s doing I mean in CNN</text>
  <text start="710.689" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re saying that China&amp;#39;s new world</text>
  <text start="712.97" dur="5.519">order G Putin and others meet for the</text>
  <text start="716.299" dur="4.561">belt and road form now we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="718.489" dur="3.601">meeting going on North Korea&amp;#39;s included</text>

  <text start="724.82" dur="4.41">this saying yeah it would be a great</text>
  <text start="726.08" dur="7.35">idea if we join this and China&amp;#39;s belt</text>
  <text start="729.23" dur="7.17">and Road summit since it started they</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="5.61">realize that China well they&amp;#39;re starting</text>

  <text start="739.04" dur="5.31">Silk Road system is going to run</text>
  <text start="741.62" dur="5.94">throughout Europe and maybe one day into</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="7.17">the United States and we can see that as</text>
  <text start="747.56" dur="6.99">they do this this is just another nail</text>
  <text start="751.52" dur="5.79">in the petrodollars coffin and this is</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="5.37">why the United States needs to be a part</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="4.8">of this because if the United States is</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="4.83">left out and we go down the path of the</text>
  <text start="762.11" dur="4.23">globalists well the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="764.75" dur="3.75">going to be trading in this remember</text>
  <text start="766.34" dur="3.99">China and Russia India and other</text>
  <text start="768.5" dur="4.89">countries they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating gold</text>
  <text start="770.33" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this exact</text>
  <text start="773.39" dur="5.52">situation they replicated everything</text>
  <text start="776.39" dur="5.7">here in the West and it is out in the</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="6.69">East so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="782.09" dur="6.84">that this belt and road it is a game</text>
  <text start="785.6" dur="5.97">changer and this system meshes with</text>
  <text start="788.93" dur="4.32">Russia&amp;#39;s Eurasian vision coming together</text>
  <text start="791.57" dur="4.8">provide a road map which includes a</text>
  <text start="793.25" dur="4.62">broad swath of countries with contiguous</text>
  <text start="796.37" dur="4.02">or strategic interests on the</text>
  <text start="797.87" dur="5.52">Continental landmass from South China</text>
  <text start="800.39" dur="5.43">Sea to the Baltic one of the key ten</text>
  <text start="803.39" dur="4.38">into these programs is the promotion of</text>
  <text start="805.82" dur="3.93">free trade</text>
  <text start="807.77" dur="4.56">China has put its money where its mouth</text>
  <text start="809.75" dur="5.85">is they have spent about a hundred</text>
  <text start="812.33" dur="5.67">billion yuan deposited for the Silk Road</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="4.74">fund to assist infrastructure projects</text>
  <text start="818" dur="5.25">and sixty billion you want in a</text>
  <text start="820.34" dur="4.14">developing countries in addition Chinese</text>
  <text start="823.25" dur="3.09">government run banks are now</text>
  <text start="824.48" dur="3.45">establishing lending mechanisms of</text>
  <text start="826.34" dur="2.91">approximately three hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="827.93" dur="4.74">billion you want to support the project</text>
  <text start="829.25" dur="4.89">and both China and Russia they agree</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="2.94">that the economic development will</text>
  <text start="834.14" dur="4.02">enhance political stability throughout</text>
  <text start="835.61" dur="5.79">the many countries in the region now</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="5.28">Putin has welcomed the initiative as a</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="3.75">promotion of peace and development of</text>
  <text start="843.44" dur="3.95">particular interest is the great</text>
  <text start="845.15" dur="4.53">enthusiasm of the British representative</text>
  <text start="847.39" dur="4.42">which can be explained in many different</text>
  <text start="849.68" dur="4.92">ways the United States also spoke in</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="4.23">support of the belt and road initiative</text>
  <text start="854.6" dur="3.84">writing various ways in which the</text>
  <text start="856.04" dur="5.609">country is developing infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="858.44" dur="6.569">various industries and we can see right</text>
  <text start="861.649" dur="5.61">now that many countries are joining this</text>
  <text start="865.009" dur="5.791">many countries are going to be a part of</text>
  <text start="867.259" dur="6.481">this the TPP is dead the TTIP is dead</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="5.339">and we can see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="873.74" dur="4.44">dollar is no longer going to be the</text>
  <text start="876.139" dur="4.111">reserve currency is it going to be the</text>
  <text start="878.18" dur="4.98">reserve currency of the second yes but</text>
  <text start="880.25" dur="5.19">moving forward in the future it will no</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="5.07">longer be the reserve country because</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="4.079">when this system comes down that whole</text>
  <text start="888.23" dur="4.32">thing is going to be wiped out</text>
  <text start="889.519" dur="7.32">completely so one thing we know for sure</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="7.289">is that the economy is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="896.839" dur="5.67">on itself the debt level is too high the</text>
  <text start="899.839" dur="6.031">system is going nowhere and we can see</text>
  <text start="902.509" dur="4.77">that we have two factions the Trump</text>
  <text start="905.87" dur="3.779">factor in the motel just call the Trump</text>
  <text start="907.279" dur="4.411">faction we have a central bank faction</text>
  <text start="909.649" dur="4.92">yes we have other little factions out</text>
  <text start="911.69" dur="5.639">there that want war and other things but</text>
  <text start="914.569" dur="6.051">these are the main ones and they are</text>
  <text start="917.329" dur="6.36">working now to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="920.62" dur="6.04">what you need to do at this point is to</text>
  <text start="923.689" dur="6.061">make sure that you are prepared for what</text>
  <text start="926.66" dur="5.52">is coming make sure that you have water</text>
  <text start="929.75" dur="4.86">make sure that you have food make sure</text>
  <text start="932.18" dur="5.25">you have a weapon make sure you have</text>
  <text start="934.61" dur="6.87">some form of gold and silver you can buy</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="7.349">junk silver pre-1960 for dimes and</text>
  <text start="941.48" dur="5.64">quarters and things like that make sure</text>
  <text start="944.779" dur="4.711">you if you can&amp;#39;t afford it have gold</text>
  <text start="947.12" dur="3.81">make sure that you have a weapon to</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="3.36">protect your family make sure you have</text>
  <text start="950.93" dur="3.48">medical supplies because the reason I</text>
  <text start="952.85" dur="4.2">say this is because when things start to</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="5.609">really rapidly fall apart I should say</text>
  <text start="957.05" dur="5.339">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is those dollars</text>
  <text start="960.019" dur="4.32">that have been offshored</text>
  <text start="962.389" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re coming back here because</text>
  <text start="964.339" dur="4.35">countries will no longer need it because</text>
  <text start="966.35" dur="5.01">the dollar will no longer be the reserve</text>
  <text start="968.689" dur="4.65">currency of the world and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="971.36" dur="5.669">see hyperinflation here like we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="973.339" dur="6.211">seen before and when that does hit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.029" dur="3.691">going to be pretty darn bad and credit</text>
  <text start="979.55" dur="3.21">is going to freeze up we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="980.72" dur="4.619">seeing credit freeze up right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="982.76" dur="5.04">already getting signs of that and once</text>
  <text start="985.339" dur="3.131">it does well it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="987.8" dur="3.22">difficult for</text>
  <text start="988.47" dur="4.89">many individuals this is why China</text>
  <text start="991.02" dur="3.75">Russia and other countries have been</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="3.39">accumulating gold because they</text>
  <text start="994.77" dur="4.38">understand gold is money</text>
  <text start="996.75" dur="4.65">the paper currency that we see today or</text>
  <text start="999.15" dur="5.49">the in the electronic form guess what</text>
  <text start="1001.4" dur="5.82">that is no longer going to exist but we</text>
  <text start="1004.64" dur="4.62">do need to hold some cash on hand</text>
  <text start="1007.22" dur="4.23">because when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="1009.26" dur="3.93">people will still recognize the cash</text>
  <text start="1011.45" dur="3.78">even though you&amp;#39;ll need a lot more of it</text>
  <text start="1013.19" dur="3.87">but you will use this in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1015.23" dur="3.78">you will not use gold and silver you</text>
  <text start="1017.06" dur="4.38">might not even use that at all you might</text>
  <text start="1019.01" dur="4.83">go into bordering because I would hold</text>
  <text start="1021.44" dur="5.16">on to the gold and silver to the very</text>
  <text start="1023.84" dur="4.95">last minute until everything is brought</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="3.39">back online reestablished and things</text>
  <text start="1028.79" dur="3.87">like that and this is why I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="1029.99" dur="6.09">you to have these type of supplies to</text>
  <text start="1032.66" dur="5.64">have cash on hand because people</text>
  <text start="1036.08" dur="4.14">normally don&amp;#39;t have this many people</text>
  <text start="1038.3" dur="3.66">just have their credit cards or maybe a</text>
  <text start="1040.22" dur="4.89">debit card and they do everything</text>
  <text start="1041.96" dur="5.07">electronically and if all of this is</text>
  <text start="1045.11" dur="4.38">gone electronically there will be</text>
  <text start="1047.03" dur="3.9">nothing because you know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1049.49" dur="3.72">happen the banks are going to come in</text>
  <text start="1050.93" dur="4.38">the central bank they&amp;#39;re going to take</text>
  <text start="1053.21" dur="3.87">the funds from within the bank to keep</text>
  <text start="1055.31" dur="2.97">the system operational because the</text>
  <text start="1057.08" dur="3.27">central bank they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1058.28" dur="4.77">whatever they have to to try to keep the</text>
  <text start="1060.35" dur="4.71">system alive to say no no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1063.05" dur="3.33">important we can keep it alive look we</text>
  <text start="1065.06" dur="3.06">just need to do this and that and the</text>
  <text start="1066.38" dur="3.36">other thing and they&amp;#39;ll try to prop it</text>
  <text start="1068.12" dur="4.46">up again they&amp;#39;ll try to pump up the</text>
  <text start="1069.74" dur="5.94">market again while on the other hand if</text>
  <text start="1072.58" dur="5.04">Trump&amp;#39;s plan works they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1075.68" dur="4.77">continually try to destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="1077.62" dur="5.86">so we could see right now that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1080.45" dur="5.52">a tough situation but no matter what</text>
  <text start="1083.48" dur="5.34">happens here the economy is coming down</text>
  <text start="1085.97" dur="6.75">and we really don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1088.82" dur="4.98">emerge on top and say okay this is the</text>
  <text start="1092.72" dur="3.24">way it&amp;#39;s going to be I mean if the</text>
  <text start="1093.8" dur="4.05">central bank does and they were able to</text>
  <text start="1095.96" dur="3.96">get rid of Trump well we&amp;#39;re back in</text>
  <text start="1097.85" dur="4.65">their system if the Trump and his</text>
  <text start="1099.92" dur="5.88">individuals emerge well we&amp;#39;re on a</text>
