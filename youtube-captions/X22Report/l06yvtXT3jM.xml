  <text start="54.559" dur="5.341">president&amp;#39;s day the market is closed but</text>
  <text start="57.199" dur="5.61">we see other markets are still operating</text>
  <text start="59.9" dur="5.07">and it looks like today was an okay day</text>
  <text start="62.809" dur="5.341">all the markets were up because as we</text>
  <text start="64.97" dur="5.07">know Friday the United States ended the</text>
  <text start="68.15" dur="4.5">week on a happy ending they knew it was</text>
  <text start="70.04" dur="5.28">a three-day weekend and of course this</text>

  <text start="77.69" dur="5.999">is dropped by 30 or so dollars and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="81.68" dur="5.189">expecting that this might drop a little</text>
  <text start="83.689" dur="4.86">bit more to push it back down because we</text>
  <text start="86.869" dur="5.43">see the central bankers right now are</text>
  <text start="88.549" dur="7.1">definitely um giving us some type of</text>
  <text start="92.299" dur="6.721">message right now that they are pushing</text>
  <text start="95.649" dur="6.911">this propaganda forward letting everyone</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="6.269">know that everything is fine and gold</text>
  <text start="102.56" dur="5.189">you see is settling back to where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.289" dur="5.25">supposed to be and there&amp;#39;s nothing to be</text>
  <text start="107.749" dur="6.031">afraid of please place your money in the</text>
  <text start="110.539" dur="4.951">market the economy is doing fine but as</text>
  <text start="113.78" dur="3.78">we know the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="6.21">falling apart and collapsing at this</text>
  <text start="117.56" dur="6.089">time the Japanese economy well we know</text>
  <text start="121.7" dur="4.5">is not doing well they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="123.649" dur="5.551">currency printing and we see Japan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.2" dur="5.67">economy has shrank by 0.4% between</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="5.49">October in December compared with</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="5.43">previous quarters and on an annualized</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="4.94">basis the economy contracted by one</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="6.9">point four percent during this period</text>
  <text start="139.63" dur="9.3">wages in Japan haven&amp;#39;t grown more than</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="7.28">one percent in any year since 1997 and</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="6.16">actually shrank in the last four years</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="6.82">when you adjust for inflation so what</text>
  <text start="155.09" dur="6.6">does this tell us that Japan&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="5.51">has gone nowhere and it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="4.64">falling apart as</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="4.44">can see with other economies across the</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="4.5">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="4.5">and we know that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="3.72">negative interest rates we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="3.72">trying to get rid of currency because</text>
  <text start="174.55" dur="4.47">this is the only way they can control</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="6.21">the situation and we can see and we</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="5.46">mentioned this before that the ECB was</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="5.99">out there saying okay we need to get rid</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="6.69">of the 500 euro bill and it looks like</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="8.11">they&amp;#39;re pushing the agenda Ford right</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="8.849">now because right now draggy is out</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="7.489">there saying that any ECB action on the</text>
  <text start="200.019" dur="8.19">EU 500 note is not about reducing cash</text>
  <text start="204.269" dur="6.011">well what this really means is the ECB</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="4.921">action is only about reducing physical</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.429">cash about some thirty percent to be</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="6.81">specific here and where do I get this</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="7.951">number well we realize there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="6.15">these bills in circulation the 500 euro</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="6.15">note is the second highest currency</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="7.92">denomination in the g10 countries more</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="6.39">importantly the total value of the 500</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="5.34">euro note in circulation amounts to</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="8.129">about three hundred and 6.8 billion</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="9.06">euros and has been rising and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.329" dur="8.451">seeing right now is that if they get rid</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="8.69">of this what does this mean this means</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="9.639">this is their way of beginning the</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="6.789">cashless society and we see at this</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="3.631">point they went with the higher note</text>
  <text start="263.889" dur="4.681">because people are still using the other</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="5.369">notes like the 20s the 50s the hundreds</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="5.4">the tens and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="5.731">the next one to go is probably the</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="10.22">hundred or the 50s and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="9.81">continually do this as time goes on so</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.74">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we are on</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="7.17">our way to a cashless society they</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="6.69">needed to start somewhere which means</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="4.38">this will then move to</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="5.88">their countries especially here in the</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="6.05">US and they will do the same thing so</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="5.46">for the Fed to react to the ECB</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="5.919">scrapping their 500 euro note what are</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="5.7">they going to do well maybe they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="6.361">rid of a hundred dollar bills maybe</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;ll get rid of something else and</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="3.24">this is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="4.8">out for because when they start doing</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="5.28">this this shows us that we&amp;#39;re heading to</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="4.65">the point where okay they made the</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="4.619">decision we&amp;#39;re going to a cashless</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="4.26">society they start a little bit at a</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="3.871">time and they start taking it away a</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="3.65">little bit at a time before there is</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="6.629">nothing left and there everyone is using</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="7.84">the plastic now we see that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="340.479" dur="7.081">huge amount of oil on the market there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="6.54">a huge glut and this has many different</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="4.919">agendas one is to put a lot of pressure</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="8.46">on Russia to if you really think about</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="10.221">it airlines trucking deliveries all the</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="7.76">manufacturing to create these products</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="7.93">having this reduced oil allows them to</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="7.87">make more profits because what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="6.39">seen in the past is that the pricing on</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="5.97">all of these products have gone up when</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="6.56">oil prices have gone up when oil prices</text>
  <text start="380.41" dur="8.64">have come down what have we seen prices</text>
  <text start="383.58" dur="7.39">may be full of a tiny bit but nowhere</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="4.1">near where they used to be at the same</text>
  <text start="390.97" dur="4.62">time period that oil was at this price</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="5.17">so which this which this allows</text>
  <text start="395.59" dur="6.259">companies then to continually make</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="6.06">profits because without this companies</text>
  <text start="401.849" dur="5.201">would be a complete disaster at this</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="8.13">point and they know this so this agenda</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="9.36">is one they wanted the people to take</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="6.02">that oils to take that oil savings and</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="5.9">put it back into the market two</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="6.189">companies can continually make profits</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="4.27">because of their transportation costs</text>
  <text start="424.719" dur="3.481">are reduced the production costs are</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="3.84">reduced and they can keep the high</text>
  <text start="428.2" dur="6.39">prices on products</text>
  <text start="430.42" dur="6.84">and we see that this pressure being put</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="6.14">on Russia and there&amp;#39;s another reason to</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="7.71">have so much oil around the world</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="7.42">because when we go to war a lot of</text>
  <text start="444.97" dur="7.25">countries now are storing their oil in</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="6.72">underground areas storage facilities</text>
  <text start="452.22" dur="5.68">because as you know when war starts it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="5.61">very difficult to get oil and this could</text>
  <text start="457.9" dur="6.66">be another agenda of why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="460.48" dur="7.77">this united arab emirates they have</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="6.09">offered free oil to india in return for</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="5.79">a storage deal at india&amp;#39;s planned</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="5.04">underground facility I mean this is how</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="5.19">much oil there is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="475.69" dur="6.9">ridiculous at this point and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="5.97">want to stop production because if they</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="5.3">do in oil prices go back up it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="485.2" dur="6">to be a disaster on the airlines on</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.93">manufacturers on many of the</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="4.8">corporations that were depending on</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="5.37">these profits the pressure would be off</text>
  <text start="496" dur="5.55">of Russia and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.19" dur="7.8">continually pushing their agenda right</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="8.48">now and as we get closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="6.72">this economic collapse we realize that</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="4.72">it just can&amp;#39;t switch around it we just</text>
  <text start="512.71" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t all of a sudden say okay the</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="6.66">economy is better now it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="5.67">like that everything at this point from</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="4.68">all the indicators that we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="522.82" dur="7.8">everything is starting to fall apart the</text>
  <text start="526.09" dur="6.6">global growth leading indicators they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="7.38">all screaming collapse the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="9.9">Index PMI s and others are all telling</text>
  <text start="538" dur="7.5">us something is drastically wrong with</text>
  <text start="542.59" dur="5.9">the global economy and then we look at</text>
  <text start="545.5" dur="6.23">the world economic climate index and</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="5.47">that has declined right now and</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="4.51">basically giving us a signal that the</text>
  <text start="553.96" dur="6.36">global economy is heading into a major</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="8.17">storm we&amp;#39;re heading to the same position</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="7.209">that we were back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="6.539">were past that point and we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="567.529" dur="9.81">down further the world economy dropped</text>
  <text start="570.949" dur="8.82">from 89.6 to 87.8 and we see the</text>
  <text start="577.339" dur="5.971">economic climate is deteriorating in all</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="6.841">regions just to give you some idea of</text>
  <text start="583.31" dur="5.339">where we were prior to 2008 we were</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="5.399">approaching about a hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="588.649" dur="8.911">points when everything started to slide</text>
  <text start="592.009" dur="9.601">in 2008 we approached 89 points and then</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="8.639">it dipped down all the way to about 55</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="9.68">points so here we are at eighty seven</text>
  <text start="606.199" dur="5.091">point eight points on a downward trend</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="6.969">this does not look good we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="5.009">into an area where everything is</text>
  <text start="618.439" dur="4.02">starting to really fall apart and this</text>
  <text start="620.509" dur="3.95">is why you need to be prepared we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.459" dur="4.591">seeing these fluctuations in the market</text>
  <text start="624.459" dur="7.421">the central bankers are trying to keep</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="8.339">control and you need to prep you need to</text>
  <text start="631.88" dur="5.129">get ready for what is coming you need</text>
  <text start="635.389" dur="5.491">your food you need your water you need</text>
  <text start="637.009" dur="5.491">supplies you need your gold silver this</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="4.23">is a gift the prices are being</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="6.209">suppressed by the central banks i would</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="6.18">start purchasing some silver and gold if</text>
  <text start="648.709" dur="4.5">you haven&amp;#39;t I would start now I would</text>
  <text start="651.29" dur="4.739">make sure you have the food and supplies</text>
  <text start="653.209" dur="6.11">already because as we know as the</text>
  <text start="656.029" dur="5.55">country&amp;#39;s stop using the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="659.319" dur="4.721">remove the dollar in their reserves</text>
  <text start="661.579" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;re going to see a flood of dollars</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="3.359">come back to the United States which</text>
  <text start="665.24" dur="4.289">will cause the devaluation in the dollar</text>
  <text start="667.399" dur="4.41">which means you&amp;#39;re going to need more</text>
  <text start="669.529" dur="5.61">dollars to pay for the products which is</text>
  <text start="671.809" dur="5.4">hyper inflation or inflation and of</text>
  <text start="675.139" dur="4.411">course we&amp;#39;re gonna have inflation things</text>
  <text start="677.209" dur="4.5">will get even worse the Fed will say</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;ll have to create more currency and</text>
  <text start="681.709" dur="4.32">this will drive prices up because things</text>
  <text start="683.93" dur="3.12">will really start to fall apart if you</text>
  <text start="686.029" dur="3.901">haven&amp;#39;t started you can go to life</text>
  <text start="687.05" dur="4.8">reliance calm they have bug out bags see</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="4.44">to water filtration systems you can</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="4.95">customize your orders but whatever</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="3.85">you&amp;#39;re doing I would not stop at this</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="3.73">point I would ramp it up</text>
  <text start="698.22" dur="4.59">because we&amp;#39;re seeing from many different</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="4.59">areas even on the corporate media that</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="4.86">they have to recognize that something is</text>
  <text start="705.12" dur="5.43">wrong in the economy and they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="707.67" dur="5.37">out saying yes it&amp;#39;s slowing we might be</text>
  <text start="710.55" dur="5.43">moving towards a recession even though</text>
  <text start="713.04" dur="5.1">Obama has telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="715.98" dur="4.59">recovery even though the central bank</text>
  <text start="718.14" dur="3.87">has told us this is why they raise the</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="4.41">interest rates because the economy has</text>
  <text start="722.01" dur="8.04">recovered well this is all for political</text>
  <text start="724.98" dur="7.2">um political show this is not what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="3.45">really happening what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="3.36">is every single one of the indicators</text>
  <text start="733.5" dur="4.32">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at through all</text>
  <text start="735.54" dur="8.57">these reports are showing us that the</text>
  <text start="737.82" dur="10.32">economy is dying the dollar is dying and</text>
  <text start="744.11" dur="7.45">as time goes on it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="748.14" dur="4.98">and worse and this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="751.56" dur="5.28">prepared and if you&amp;#39;ve been listening to</text>
