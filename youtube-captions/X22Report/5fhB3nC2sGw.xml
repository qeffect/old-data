  <text start="73.65" dur="7.65">and geopolitical news now we know that Q</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="6.93">has been telling us that information is</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="6.209">going to be dropped very soon most</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="8.13">likely the unredacted 20 pages of the</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="6.331">FISA and maybe even the entire IG report</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="3.87">and we know that&amp;#39;s coming very soon</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.68">because Q has been telling us twice now</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="3.84">to get prepared for this and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.55">believe this is going to be an easy time</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="5.58">for America and we also know that the</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="4.23">deep state they&amp;#39;re going to be putting</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="6.12">out information to counter all of this</text>
  <text start="108.3" dur="5.97">and to distract the American public and</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="5.94">they might even use a false flag of some</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="4.98">type an event to distract from what is</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="3.72">happening here and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="4.229">starting to see some articles come out</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="4.83">where they&amp;#39;re going to try to use these</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.801">articles to distract have people</text>
  <text start="126.18" dur="3.809">questioned and we&amp;#39;re already seeing it</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="6.179">from the New York Times they publish an</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="8.851">anonymous op-ed it&amp;#39;s a saboteur inside</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="6.84">the Trump White House and basically this</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="5.25">individual who&amp;#39;s anonymous says they</text>
  <text start="141.299" dur="5.551">work inside the White House and they are</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="5.82">part of the resistance inside the Trump</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="5.25">administration and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="6.359">that they&amp;#39;re trying to use whatever they</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="6.27">possibly can to combat what is about to</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="4.981">drop they&amp;#39;re very nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re very afraid of what is about to</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="3.989">happen here and they&amp;#39;re panicking and</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re gonna use everything in their</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="5.821">arsenal to combat this but we can see</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="3.75">there are many things moving in the</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="2.7">right direction and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="3.03">very very difficult for them to do this</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="4.86">because once again they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="175.41" dur="4.139">anonymous sources they&amp;#39;re using someone</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="2.19">saying that they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>

  <text start="333.18" dur="7.8">back in time to basically register</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="6.69">themselves as a foreign agent and we can</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="6.39">see at this time that Mueller has no</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="7.02">problem with that we see that President</text>
  <text start="347.37" dur="5.88">Obama it&amp;#39;s looking like he must have</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="5.79">signed off on the FISA warrant now when</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="5.25">we look at this entire case here the</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="6.09">reason there was no Pfizer court hearing</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="7.44">on Carter page was because then Attorney</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="5.64">General Loretta Lynch under Obama forced</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="6.06">through the application / an obscure</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="6.9">loophole in the law Obama would have had</text>
  <text start="372" dur="5.07">to approve the Carter page warrant / law</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="4.98">in order for the spying to proceed</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="6.5">without a court hearing and here is the</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.73">rule it is the 1978 FISA Act</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="3.82">authorization for electronic</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="8.96">surveillance for foreign intelligence</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="10.05">purposes section 102 50 USC 1802 a1</text>

  <text start="408.81" dur="5.97">if the eternal if the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="5.58">certifies in writing under oath so it</text>
  <text start="414.78" dur="3.75">looks more and more that President Trump</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="3.99">was right when he tweeted shortly after</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="5.37">his inauguration that he was spied on by</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.61">Obama and actually cute confirms this so</text>
  <text start="423.9" dur="4.74">we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of strange</text>
  <text start="426.42" dur="3.99">things that happen and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="4.32">harder and harder for the deep state to</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="4.11">explain all of this and it will get</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.89">harder and harder because these are</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="6.06">facts this is not propaganda and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.24">all coming out right now we see that</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.31">Trump is now laying the groundwork to</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="3.75">show that Mueller is completely</text>
  <text start="445.89" dur="5.19">conflicted just like he was laying the</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="5.939">groundwork letting us know that or a and</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="6.899">his wife was working for</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="6.96">the Russians was working for steel they</text>
  <text start="457.979" dur="5.04">created the dossier he&amp;#39;s also doing this</text>
  <text start="460.739" dur="4.2">with Muller right now and he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="463.019" dur="4.89">saying that special counsel Muller is</text>
  <text start="464.939" dur="5.75">heading up in a legal investigation rife</text>
  <text start="467.909" dur="6.24">with conflicts of interest including</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="5.8">Muller himself now Trump has said the</text>
  <text start="474.149" dur="4.47">following I view it as an illegal</text>
  <text start="476.489" dur="3.75">investigation it should have never been</text>
  <text start="478.619" dur="4.65">started we should have never been</text>
  <text start="480.239" dur="5.04">allowed to start you know I&amp;#39;m not target</text>
  <text start="483.269" dur="4.56">of this investigation just in case you</text>
  <text start="485.279" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t realize this and the president</text>
  <text start="487.829" dur="3.45">went on and he showed the many reasons</text>
  <text start="489.389" dur="5.42">he considers the investigation illegal</text>
  <text start="491.279" dur="6.12">remember as Q has told us in the past</text>
  <text start="494.809" dur="5.35">they have everything - he already know</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="5.1">all of this what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="500.159" dur="6.6">is they&amp;#39;re letting the public know and</text>
  <text start="502.499" dur="7.2">the reasons why Muller can&amp;#39;t be pushing</text>
  <text start="506.759" dur="4.53">this investigation forward and why he</text>
  <text start="509.699" dur="4.25">was placed in there in the first place</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="5.461">he said number one there was no crime</text>
  <text start="513.949" dur="5.02">number two everybody was conflicted</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="5.909">including Muller there are tremendous</text>
  <text start="518.969" dur="6.99">clump conflicts here among the conflicts</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="5.641">that Trump is citing he&amp;#39;s saying that he</text>
  <text start="525.959" dur="5.521">is interviewed Mueller for the FBI</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="5.82">director role just days before he was</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="4.95">appointed as special counsel he was</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="5.279">sitting right in the chair and I liked</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="4.469">him but I didn&amp;#39;t give him the job I had</text>
  <text start="539.399" dur="4.23">a business dispute with Miller before</text>
  <text start="540.899" dur="5.221">that I had a real business dispute Trump</text>
  <text start="543.629" dur="4.291">said the president&amp;#39;s claim of a business</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="5.61">of dispute reportedly revolve around</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="7.229">decade old golf fees and he&amp;#39;s commis</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="4.979">best friend Trump insisted I could give</text>
  <text start="555.149" dur="3.42">you a hundred pictures of him and call</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="4.17">me hugging and kissing each other and</text>
  <text start="558.569" dur="4.32">then somebody from his law firm came out</text>
  <text start="560.879" dur="2.491">and said I can&amp;#39;t believe they picked</text>
  <text start="562.889" dur="2.731">Mueller</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="4.86">he hates the president he hates the</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="4.38">president so that&amp;#39;s four things that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="4.62">four right there so when you look at</text>
  <text start="570" dur="5.309">this you can see he&amp;#39;s building the idea</text>
  <text start="572.85" dur="4.5">that Mueller is conflicted which he is</text>
  <text start="575.309" dur="3.9">and he continues on with this</text>
  <text start="577.35" dur="3.87">he says it&amp;#39;s incredible when you look at</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="4.11">Andrew Weissman and all these people</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="4.26">some of the people work for the Hillary</text>
  <text start="583.319" dur="3.491">Clinton Foundation it&amp;#39;s an it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="3.78">incredible thing</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="5.31">Jeanne ray a lawyer on Mueller&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="589.26" dur="4.33">reportedly represented Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="4.35">and the Clinton Foundation in two</text>
  <text start="593.59" dur="6.06">separate 2015 cases honestly people are</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="6.24">very angry about it people that love our</text>
  <text start="599.65" dur="4.379">country are very very angry about it so</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="3.69">I consider it to be an illegal</text>
  <text start="604.029" dur="4.081">investigation it should have never been</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="3.99">allowed to have happened</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="4.05">now he&amp;#39;s just building this up letting</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="3.6">everyone know all the different</text>
  <text start="612.16" dur="4.5">conflicts because when everything hits</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="4.89">the fan this is what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="616.66" dur="4.35">present to everyone and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="618.88" dur="5.76">have all the facts and everything behind</text>
  <text start="621.01" dur="5.7">it to show this is why this whole entire</text>
  <text start="624.64" dur="4.199">witch-hunt shouldn&amp;#39;t have been allowed</text>
  <text start="626.71" dur="3.9">and there is no crime and he&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="628.839" dur="4.861">target so what is Muller doing there</text>
  <text start="630.61" dur="6.57">after two years he&amp;#39;s found nothing now</text>
  <text start="633.7" dur="6.51">of course as we know they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="4.349">Muller to present something now you know</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s going to be a nothing burger just</text>
  <text start="641.529" dur="3.271">like everything else but they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="869.029" dur="5.371">know that they use the five eyes to spy</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="4.85">on all the different countries the</text>
  <text start="874.4" dur="5.91">problem that they&amp;#39;ve been having is</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="5.56">encryption and we know from James Comey</text>
  <text start="880.31" dur="3.84">if we go back in time this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="3.81">tracking all this stuff remember when</text>
  <text start="884.15" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;re having all these false flag events</text>
  <text start="885.77" dur="3.96">and James Comey was out there in front</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="4.05">of Congress saying we need the keys to</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="3.48">all encryption we should be able to see</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="4.739">everyone&amp;#39;s message you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="893.21" dur="4.71">right to privacy and Apple said no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.089" dur="4.171">not doing this everything&amp;#39;s staying</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="3.99">encrypted you cannot see any of this and</text>
  <text start="900.26" dur="3.15">of course they dropped the case because</text>
  <text start="901.91" dur="3.3">there was an Israeli company that was</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="4.32">able to break the encryption on this</text>
  <text start="905.21" dur="4.62">particular phone because there was it</text>
  <text start="907.73" dur="5.01">was involved in this shooting in San</text>
  <text start="909.83" dur="5.699">Bernardino and they dropped it for the</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="4.5">time being now the five eyes which is a</text>
  <text start="915.529" dur="4.621">global network of intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="917.24" dur="5.69">they want easier access to your private</text>
  <text start="920.15" dur="6.06">and encrypted messages and remember</text>
  <text start="922.93" dur="5.65">under the Constitution Bill of Rights we</text>
  <text start="926.21" dur="4.26">have the right to privacy but other</text>
  <text start="928.58" dur="5.85">countries don&amp;#39;t have to abide by this so</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="6.83">New Zealand UK Australia individuals</text>
  <text start="934.43" dur="4.98">from this country like Obama Clinton</text>
  <text start="937.3" dur="4.81">Brennan they can go over to those</text>
  <text start="939.41" dur="6.81">countries and gather the information</text>
  <text start="942.11" dur="6.42">that they get and sift through it and</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s not breaking any laws so they found</text>
  <text start="948.53" dur="5.46">a way around this the problem is is the</text>
  <text start="951.8" dur="4.08">encryption now if it&amp;#39;s not government</text>
  <text start="953.99" dur="4.71">encryption they don&amp;#39;t have the method or</text>
  <text start="955.88" dur="4.59">the key and this has been their problem</text>
  <text start="958.7" dur="4.08">so they can&amp;#39;t see certain communications</text>
  <text start="960.47" dur="4.11">and they don&amp;#39;t like this because they</text>
  <text start="962.78" dur="3.75">like to know everything so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.58" dur="6">saying right now is they want all</text>
  <text start="966.53" dur="7.71">countries especially the u.s. to give</text>
  <text start="970.58" dur="5.79">them the right to see the encrypted</text>
  <text start="974.24" dur="5.64">messages they want the method and the</text>
  <text start="976.37" dur="6.089">keys to all the tech companies encrypted</text>
  <text start="979.88" dur="4.77">messages and they&amp;#39;re telling us that we</text>
  <text start="982.459" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t have the right to privacy well</text>
  <text start="984.65" dur="3.809">yeah we do</text>
  <text start="986.209" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case of</text>
  <text start="988.459" dur="5.94">why we don&amp;#39;t have the right to privacy</text>
  <text start="991.249" dur="5.4">right now and what they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="994.399" dur="5.13">is that listen</text>
  <text start="996.649" dur="4.68">cracking your files and this is the</text>
  <text start="999.529" dur="5.1">argument they&amp;#39;re using is no more</text>
  <text start="1001.329" dur="4.8">sinister than a patrol cup searching</text>
  <text start="1004.629" dur="4.041">your vehicle or house</text>
  <text start="1006.129" dur="5.671">yeah but they need a warrant for that</text>
  <text start="1008.67" dur="6.07">privacy laws must prevent arbitrary or</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="6.149">unlawful interference but privacy is not</text>
  <text start="1014.74" dur="6.959">absolute yes it is in this country it is</text>
  <text start="1017.949" dur="6.39">and they said if the companies don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1021.699" dur="5.671">cooperate voluntarily the five eyes have</text>
  <text start="1024.339" dur="4.671">ways of making them talk stubborn</text>
  <text start="1027.37" dur="4.169">companies may be hit with a</text>

  <text start="1031.539" dur="4.86">other measures the agencies warned</text>

  <text start="1036.399" dur="5.9">measures measures might be so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1039.069" dur="6.35">trying to blackmail these tech companies</text>
  <text start="1042.299" dur="6.461">into giving them complete and utter</text>
  <text start="1045.419" dur="5.531">access and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1048.76" dur="3.51">trying to find out everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1050.95" dur="4.56">going on because they&amp;#39;re desperate</text>

  <text start="1055.51" dur="4.68">into Afghanistan we can see that peace</text>
  <text start="1057.88" dur="4.44">talks are moving forward we know that</text>
  <text start="1060.19" dur="4.469">the Taliban had a meeting with Russia</text>
  <text start="1062.32" dur="5.28">and now the Taliban is saying listen</text>
  <text start="1064.659" dur="5.451">they are now in favor of direct peace</text>
  <text start="1067.6" dur="5.97">negotiations with the Afghan authorities</text>

  <text start="1076.029" dur="5.941">Iran Russia or anyone Pakistan anyone</text>
  <text start="1079.21" dur="5.459">else involved we believe that the</text>
  <text start="1081.97" dur="6.319">Taliban and the Afghan government should</text>
  <text start="1084.669" dur="6.661">work together and talk by themselves and</text>

  <text start="1104.5" dur="4.89">and inmates in a prison broke out and it</text>
  <text start="1107.5" dur="4.14">looks like the announcement was made</text>
  <text start="1109.39" dur="4.139">between the un-backed unity government</text>
  <text start="1111.64" dur="5.009">which was not an elected government and</text>

  <text start="1205.929" dur="8.011">the past has been fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="1209.61" dur="6.22">we see that Russia now is bombing the</text>

  <text start="1215.83" dur="4.05">House is out there they&amp;#39;ve issued a</text>

  <text start="1238.63" dur="3.539">mercenaries and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see</text>
  <text start="1240.52" dur="3.48">how this plays out but we can see</text>
  <text start="1242.169" dur="5.01">already the bombing runs have already</text>
  <text start="1244" dur="6.059">started we see already with the UN that</text>
  <text start="1247.179" dur="5.401">the political process in Syria has begun</text>
  <text start="1250.059" dur="5.37">so already the</text>
  <text start="1252.58" dur="5.459">last terrorist outpost is being</text>
  <text start="1255.429" dur="4.411">destroyed and if the US has to get</text>
  <text start="1258.039" dur="4.77">involved because the deep state try</text>
  <text start="1259.84" dur="5.1">something we&amp;#39;re going to bomb that area</text>
  <text start="1262.809" dur="5.191">and of course it&amp;#39;s not going to be Syria</text>
  <text start="1264.94" dur="4.28">it&amp;#39;s not going to be anything but the</text>

  <text start="1269.22" dur="4.12">rebels their infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1271.299" dur="3.63">everything that they have there so this</text>
  <text start="1273.34" dur="4.589">way Russia and Surrey can go in and</text>
  <text start="1274.929" dur="5.61">liberate the entire area and we already</text>
  <text start="1277.929" dur="5.49">see that the Syrian political process</text>
