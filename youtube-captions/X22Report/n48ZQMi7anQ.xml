  <text start="89.049" dur="5.401">to realize that the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="91.6" dur="5.449">as well as the government is saying as</text>
  <text start="94.45" dur="4.5">we know the numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="5.56">separating from their statistical</text>
  <text start="98.95" dur="7.199">information and we&amp;#39;re realizing that the</text>
  <text start="102.609" dur="6.03">cost of owning a home the cost of owning</text>
  <text start="106.149" dur="5.57">an automobile a the cost of having</text>

  <text start="111.719" dur="4.39">this is where we see a lot of people</text>

  <text start="116.109" dur="5.131">seeing right now is health care and</text>
  <text start="117.88" dur="5.279">housing costs have surged and this is</text>
  <text start="121.24" dur="5.82">the biggest rise in cork consumer prices</text>
  <text start="123.159" dur="5.46">in the last 16 months and of course the</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="3.63">US government says we don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="4.741">inflation anywhere well if they went to</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="4.92">the supermarkets and they look at the</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="6.45">health care premiums we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="8.07">inflation and we have to realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="6.45">going on here ask the story of 2015</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="4.169">maybe going back to 2014 the US</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="3.57">government central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="147.849" dur="4.981">doing whatever they possibly could to</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="4.68">keep this economy going they realized</text>
  <text start="152.83" dur="4.01">they needed to bring the oil prices down</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="6.51">because all the transportation of goods</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="7.21">airlines shipping trucks and everything</text>
  <text start="161.02" dur="4.83">else the oil prices</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="4.71">were too high and if they kept him at</text>
  <text start="165.85" dur="6.72">that level businesses right now would be</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="7.98">going completely bust they were just</text>
  <text start="172.57" dur="6.12">completely fold there is more agendas</text>
  <text start="176.74" dur="4.32">associated with why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="6.24">pushing the oil prices down one of them</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="6.12">is being that Russia deals in oil and</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="5.61">they were putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="5.91">Russia trying to destroy the economy of</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="4.29">Russia to say okay we give we will not</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="3.98">do anything in Ukraine will not do</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.94">anything around the world we are sorry</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="6.79">please stop producing so much oil and</text>
  <text start="200.77" dur="6.6">give our economy back but it looks like</text>
  <text start="203.86" dur="7.2">at this point their agenda is not</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="5.52">working and this only bought them a few</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="5.49">more months of keeping this economy</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="6.18">alive because the world doesn&amp;#39;t need all</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="4.74">of this oil at this point and Saudi</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="4.65">Arabia is continually pumping and</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="6.05">pushing as much as they possibly can out</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="6.57">to the world here in the United States</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="5.05">we are seeing so many different things</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="5.669">where the economy is completely falling</text>
  <text start="232.39" dur="5.31">apart the last couple of months we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="3.871">been seeing home builder Sentiment</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="5.039">continually rising which didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="239.83" dur="6.06">sense because new construction existing</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="6">home sales lumber prices they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="5.099">falling and the builders are saying we</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="7.851">just have hope we just have hope well</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="10.381">that has just turned around home builder</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="7.84">sentiment has plunged now November saw</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="6.63">it dropped to 62 this is the first drop</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="7.47">since May and now it comes in line with</text>
  <text start="268" dur="6.84">what&amp;#39;s really going on in the market we</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="6.57">see that lumber prices are continually</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="8.25">falling new home sales are continually</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="7.32">falling existing home sales falling and</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="5.67">now the builders are looking and saying</text>
  <text start="285.79" dur="4.94">okay the real estate market isn&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="6.24">strong as we thought and our hope is</text>
  <text start="290.73" dur="7.02">fading and as we go through this winter</text>
  <text start="295" dur="4.73">we&amp;#39;re going to see real estate really</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="3.78">take a hit and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="4.94">complete disaster now if the Fed decides</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="5.94">to raise the interest rates in December</text>
  <text start="304.67" dur="4.99">real estate will be completely done now</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="4.59">will it be done the moment this happens</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="4.8">absolutely not it will push a lot of</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.61">people out of the market which will mean</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="6.39">there&amp;#39;ll be less sales which means that</text>
  <text start="317.67" dur="5.49">existing home sales new construction</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="6.98">mortgage applications will all decline</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="8.28">which will then go into home depot lowes</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="5.65">furnishing appliances and it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="4.83">cascading effect but of course as we</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="5.46">know the Fed if they do raise the</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="4.83">interest rates it will hurt the economy</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="4.17">of course they&amp;#39;ll continue to convince</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="4.83">us that it did nothing to the economy</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="4.14">but to help it and when they announced</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re going to raise it once again</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="3.54">this is what will bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="3.57">but they will not let it get that far</text>
  <text start="350.79" dur="6.57">because they&amp;#39;ll never raise it for the</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="8.78">second time now we see industrial</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="6.75">production growth has completely slumped</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="4">October&amp;#39;s industrial production dropped</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="4.68">by point two percent missing</text>
  <text start="365.91" dur="8.58">expectations of point one percent this</text>
  <text start="368.79" dur="9">is the ninth month in a row that this</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="8.09">happened the weakest growth since</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="9.72">january of 2010 this is flashing a</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="8.67">depression signal I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="10.05">manufacturing industrial production</text>
  <text start="391.25" dur="9.16">retail sales it is all falling apart the</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="6.6">Baltic Dry Index fell again another 13</text>
  <text start="400.41" dur="7.319">points we&amp;#39;re down to 537 this is the raw</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="5.85">material that all the manufacturers use</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="4.801">to create these goods to ship out to the</text>
  <text start="410.01" dur="5.58">businesses to the stores so people can</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="6.65">purchase and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="8.7">is a complete and steady decline of</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="6.82">everything I mean manufacturing in the</text>
  <text start="424.29" dur="6.87">United States at this point is pretty</text>
  <text start="426" dur="5.67">much done and the problem is the US</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="3.15">doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="7.35">have gold the country that has the gold</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="9.18">is going to win in the end because they</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="8.67">can use that gold to back their currency</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="7.17">and if you have gold and you have it</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="4.71">backed you get what if you have your</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="5.82">currency back by it and you have</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="6.66">manufacturing you&amp;#39;ll be okay this is</text>
  <text start="456.48" dur="8.15">what the United States had after World</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="7.86">War two gold the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="464.63" dur="5.59">manufacturing because after the war</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="7.74">Europe was pretty much demolished and</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="9.03">the US was untouched and we were able to</text>
  <text start="474.66" dur="7.74">build and produce right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="7.32">does not have this gold right now has</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="7.77">tumbled for 14 of the 15 days since</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="8.28">februari 2010 they are continually</text>
  <text start="490.17" dur="7.02">pushing gold down because of gold rises</text>
  <text start="494.85" dur="6.24">this is an indication that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="6.6">something going on in the economy they</text>
  <text start="501.09" dur="5.58">want everyone to be dated one everyone</text>
  <text start="503.79" dur="4.41">convinced that this economy is fine they</text>
  <text start="506.67" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t want people taking their money and</text>
  <text start="508.2" dur="3.33">putting it into precious metals they</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="3.69">want everyone taking their money and</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="5.64">putting it into stocks into real estate</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="5.82">and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="517.17" dur="6.44">doing this this also helps the elite</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="9.57">purchase as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="8.89">now citigroup&amp;#39;s city surprise index CSI</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="5.46">is a real-time model designed to analyze</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="5.37">the accuracy of Wall Street&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="534.84" dur="5.04">forecasts a positive index value</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="4.41">indicates that the recent economic data</text>
  <text start="539.88" dur="5.49">is stronger than the consensus of</text>
  <text start="542.28" dur="5.22">economists a negative reading denotes</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="5.28">economic data which is worse than</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="5.88">expectations and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="5.52">now is that economists have been</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="5.97">consistently overestimating the strength</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="4.77">of the economy this year the magnitude</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.11">of their mrs. is not particularly</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="3.9">worsened but volatility measures and the</text>
  <text start="563.46" dur="2.189">recent record number of consecutive</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="3.689">negative</text>
  <text start="565.649" dur="6.12">are suggesting that economist models are</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="7.441">losing their grasp on the real state of</text>
  <text start="571.769" dur="8.911">the economy and right before the crash</text>
  <text start="575.97" dur="8.839">in 2008 they were very optimistic about</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="8.879">the economy saying that things look good</text>
  <text start="584.809" dur="7.931">real estate was strong everything was</text>
  <text start="589.559" dur="6.39">okay the market was continually holding</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="8.039">steady or going up at around 14,000</text>
  <text start="595.949" dur="10.291">points and then in an instant everything</text>
  <text start="600.779" dur="9.451">came to a crashing end now we understand</text>
  <text start="606.24" dur="7.86">the president is pushing the TPP which</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="6.18">we know does not help the people of the</text>
  <text start="614.1" dur="4.829">world at all it helps the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="5.519">the central bankers and we see that</text>
  <text start="618.929" dur="7.83">there are activists out there who are</text>
  <text start="621.929" dur="8.491">protesting in Washington DC in front of</text>
  <text start="626.759" dur="6.39">the offices of Morgan Stanley protestors</text>
  <text start="630.42" dur="6.389">pushed by the company security as they</text>
  <text start="633.149" dur="5.37">charged into the building and we see</text>
  <text start="636.809" dur="4.801">right now that Morgan Stanley is one of</text>
  <text start="638.519" dur="6.451">those US companies who supports the TPP</text>
  <text start="641.61" dur="10.339">and has spent almost 10 million dollars</text>
  <text start="644.97" dur="9.659">on lobbying for this legislation and</text>
  <text start="651.949" dur="6.461">anti TPP rallies are going to be held in</text>
  <text start="654.629" dur="4.861">Washington throughout this week but of</text>
  <text start="658.41" dur="3.119">course the corporate media is not</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="5.279">covering this whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="661.529" dur="6.06">you to know about this most of the</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="5.101">people who know about the TPP are</text>
  <text start="667.589" dur="7.67">completely against it countries around</text>
  <text start="669.87" dur="9.809">the world are protesting against the TPP</text>
  <text start="675.259" dur="8.351">Putin is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying this</text>
  <text start="679.679" dur="6.78">closed-door TPP style talks does not</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="6.959">facilitate any type of asian-pacific</text>
  <text start="686.459" dur="7.261">growth he says what we need is deeper</text>
  <text start="690.569" dur="6.81">regional integration carried out openly</text>
  <text start="693.72" dur="5.25">and based on mutual consensus this is</text>
  <text start="697.379" dur="2.101">the key to spurring asia-pacific</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="4.71">Economic</text>
  <text start="699.48" dur="6.479">roof and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right keeping</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="4.83">everything confidential keeping</text>
  <text start="705.959" dur="5.341">everything a secret keeping it so</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="5.699">corporations and central banks benefit</text>
  <text start="711.3" dur="5.94">while the people don&amp;#39;t does not spur</text>
  <text start="714.209" dur="6.111">economic growth but I think the US and</text>
  <text start="717.24" dur="7.039">the central bankers they understand this</text>
  <text start="720.32" dur="7.18">they realize that as this system</text>
  <text start="724.279" dur="7.291">implodes they want all the countries to</text>
  <text start="727.5" dur="7.05">come in line with them for control</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="6.37">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing right now this</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="6.87">is the last attempt to keep this economy</text>
  <text start="737.94" dur="6.81">alive by taking away all control from</text>
  <text start="741.42" dur="6.5">every single person and bringing all the</text>
  <text start="744.75" dur="6.36">funds flowing here to the United States</text>
  <text start="747.92" dur="5.409">jobs are not going to be flowing here if</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s what everyone thinks because as</text>
  <text start="753.329" dur="6.63">we&amp;#39;ve seen part of the TPP is to bring</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="4.979">in people from other countries to work</text>
  <text start="759.959" dur="5.701">here in the United States but they do</text>
  <text start="762.089" dur="6.781">not have to pay them the US wages they</text>
  <text start="765.66" dur="5.789">can pay them in whatever country they</text>
  <text start="768.87" dur="5.76">came from in their wages which will make</text>
