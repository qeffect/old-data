  <text start="125.07" dur="8.91">Patriots need need each piece to come</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="6.81">into play to create this plan and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="4.94">talking about gold we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="5.099">trade we&amp;#39;re talking about manufacturing</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="6.67">we&amp;#39;re talking about bringing down the</text>
  <text start="141.599" dur="6.441">central bank system all of this has to</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="4.71">be set up in a certain way</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="5.169">remember queue has been telling us that</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="7.38">gold is going to bring down the central</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="7.451">bank system which means the United</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.17">States is going to have to have gold</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="5.1">the gold price is going to have to</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="6.57">outshine no pun intended the dollar and</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="7.04">it&amp;#39;s going to have to expose the central</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="5.97">bank system while all that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="8.74">Trump needs to prepare the United States</text>
  <text start="175.39" dur="9.6">for the transition we need companies we</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="5.52">need manufacturing we need job openings</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="3.57">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about waiters and</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="3.78">waitresses nothing against waiters or</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="5.43">waitresses or anything like that but to</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="6.06">have a successful country you need all</text>
  <text start="193.99" dur="6.81">these pieces coming together</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="5.97">I remember those who didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="5.01">United States to survive they were</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="6.9">getting rid of it now everything is</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="7.5">being turned around on them and this is</text>
  <text start="209.77" dur="6.33">the push that Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.94">doing right now they&amp;#39;re bringing all</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="6.51">these different pieces together to</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="6.9">create this economy that will transition</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="6.72">us from the central banking system into</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="7.59">this new system remember the petro</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="6.3">dollar was created so the dollar would</text>
  <text start="233.74" dur="4.31">be able to come off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="5.76">and move over to the oil standard and</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="6.61">this way the central banks had the</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="6.63">ability to create as much currency as</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="6.78">they wanted allowing the government to</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="5.85">borrow as much as they wanted without</text>
  <text start="251.44" dur="5.16">any checks balances or anything like</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="6.45">that which then created corruption</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="7.53">further corruption and it got worse</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="6.69">since the 70s everything just went</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="4.11">haywire actually in the 60s the central</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="3.21">bank before we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="4.47">standard they started to create currency</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="5.27">like crazy this is when country started</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="4.92">to realize what was going on here and</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="7">this is why they were asking for their</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="8.97">gold back and here we are everything is</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="7.29">exposed everything is being set up</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="6.84">perfectly and you need all the pieces in</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="4.65">place because once we bring everything</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="3.47">back</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="7.14">once we bring the gold-standard back</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="6.759">once we do this guess what countries</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re not gonna be holding the dollar</text>
  <text start="303.669" dur="5.821">as a reserve currency they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="306.25" dur="5.13">use it to buy goods here in the United</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="6.269">States this is why we need to create</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="7.71">trade once again and that is the</text>
  <text start="315.759" dur="6.991">direction we are headed in now out in</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="7.609">the UK we see things are not going well</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="7.65">for May she went all the way to Brussels</text>
  <text start="326.699" dur="8.831">to convince the EU I need an extension</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="9">and they denied it why because first</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="8.37">they want a reasonable vote on her plan</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="7.71">then they&amp;#39;ll grant her an extension well</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="9.269">this is not going to work her plan or</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="9.63">the --use plan was rejected twice so</text>
  <text start="353.169" dur="6.691">right now cabinet ministers have been</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.02">telling many reporters that maze days</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="4.07">are numbered</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="7.7">they might even expect her to resign</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="7.769">soon now this is unbelievable here and</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="7.63">there are problems here in the UK</text>
  <text start="371.699" dur="6.581">because the EU the central bank and</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="5.299">certain individuals wanted a certain way</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="5.16">the people wanted a different way and</text>
  <text start="381.389" dur="5.65">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now Deutsche</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="5.849">Bank they&amp;#39;ve raised the odds on a No</text>
  <text start="387.039" dur="5.37">Deal exit to their highest level yet of</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="6.6">20% it was 15 percent now it&amp;#39;s 20</text>
  <text start="392.409" dur="6.51">percent however a No Deal</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="5.551">exit isn&amp;#39;t the bank&amp;#39;s base case it</text>
  <text start="398.919" dur="5.731">continues to expect the EU to approve a</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="5.82">long term article 50 extension after may</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.28">resigns now they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="4.2">reintroduce the same exact plan if she</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="4.2">resigns they&amp;#39;re gonna try to introduce</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.86">the same exact plan and have it voted on</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="5.19">now people are not stupid they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="7.02">realize that hey we don&amp;#39;t want this plan</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="8.91">that&amp;#39;s still going to be a problem so we</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="7.71">might see still a No Deal exit</text>
  <text start="428.23" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;ll have to say and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="6.36">how this plays out but as we can see</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s not going in the direction the EU</text>
  <text start="437.41" dur="7.62">wants and the people are rejecting their</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="6.09">plan even Trump is out there saying this</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="5.28">is not a good plan get a good plan and</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="4.77">the United States will have a bilateral</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="4.26">trade agreement with you actually there</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="4.08">are many countries waiting in the wings</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="6.45">that have bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="6.42">with the UK here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="461.02" dur="5.88">know that the Fed decided not to raise</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="8.55">rates in 2019 what did this do this</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="6.9">helped trump immensely think about what</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="6">has been happening here the deep sate</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="7.35">the central banks they were pushing to</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.82">bring down the economy in 2020 right at</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="4.02">the election time because when you hit</text>
  <text start="483.22" dur="4.62">people in their wallets people respond</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="5.3">if the economy went down right before</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="4.83">the election everyone blamed Trump and</text>
  <text start="490.47" dur="4.24">their candidate whoever they were going</text>
  <text start="492.67" dur="4.44">to have there that person would be a</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="7.02">shoo-in and everything that Trump did</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="6.09">would be undone Hugh told us that they</text>
  <text start="501.73" dur="5.31">already know this plan and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="6.78">to stop it as we can see Trump has full</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="3.86">control of what the Fed is going to do</text>
  <text start="509.98" dur="5.07">next</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="6.85">we also understand that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="515.05" dur="6.36">media the deep state they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="7.35">make it seem like the economy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="7.08">doing well because now the Fed decided</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="7.5">not to raise rates so now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="7.5">to spin it that trumps economy isn&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="5.28">great and maybe it&amp;#39;s only a statistical</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="3.81">type of an economy they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="3.51">everything they possibly can think about</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="5.43">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="6.15">to use every angle without saying Trump</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.92">is manipulating the statistical</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="5.1">information because they know once they</text>
  <text start="550.15" dur="5.1">come out and say that well it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.32">over for all of them and because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="2.28">just gonna turn around saying I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="556.96" dur="3.39">changed a thing</text>
  <text start="557.53" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re using exactly what you gave me so</text>
  <text start="560.35" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re telling me Obama</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="4.83">Bush Clinton and the rest they were all</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="4.729">using these type of calculations and</text>
  <text start="566.8" dur="4.709">you&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re all manipulated</text>
  <text start="569.279" dur="3.91">but they&amp;#39;re trying to go around it</text>
  <text start="571.509" dur="4.471">trying to make it seem like well since</text>
  <text start="573.189" dur="5.221">the Fed didn&amp;#39;t raise rates that means</text>
  <text start="575.98" dur="5.029">the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing as well as we</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="5.369">all thought now remember that whole</text>
  <text start="581.009" dur="4.45">mainstream media push that twenty twenty</text>
  <text start="583.779" dur="4.05">nineteen the economy&amp;#39;s gonna slow in</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="3.81">2020 we&amp;#39;re gonna go into a recession if</text>
  <text start="587.829" dur="4.74">you notice they&amp;#39;re really not mentioning</text>
  <text start="589.269" dur="5.851">that much anymore about that you might</text>
  <text start="592.569" dur="6.33">see it here and there but that big push</text>
  <text start="595.12" dur="6.659">is now gone now what I think is going to</text>
  <text start="598.899" dur="6.75">happen I think this is going to push the</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="5.37">markets up remember throughout all these</text>
  <text start="605.649" dur="3.901">years the Meisha and we talked about</text>
  <text start="607.149" dur="4.081">this many many times before before Trump</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="4.38">this was during Obama this is right</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="5.49">after the Great Recession of 2008 they</text>
  <text start="613.93" dur="5.25">used a stock market as a gauge on how</text>
  <text start="616.72" dur="6.599">the economy&amp;#39;s doing and we know this is</text>
  <text start="619.18" dur="6.42">not true Trump just had the stock market</text>
  <text start="623.319" dur="5.64">move up once again and it might even go</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="4.799">even higher because we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="628.959" dur="3.961">see people saying okay listen that are</text>
  <text start="630.399" dur="4.5">raising rates this is fantastic let me</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="5.159">go buy some stocks here and stocks</text>
  <text start="634.899" dur="7.68">continually rise what else are we seeing</text>
  <text start="638.079" dur="10.081">well since they&amp;#39;re not raising rates we</text>
  <text start="642.579" dur="7.921">might see gold inch up higher now why</text>
  <text start="648.16" dur="5.039">would we see this well remember Basel</text>
  <text start="650.5" dur="6.66">three central banks now have the ability</text>
  <text start="653.199" dur="6.421">to purchase gold right now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="3.96">to see the gold price stay pretty steady</text>
  <text start="659.62" dur="5.189">it&amp;#39;s not going to move that much not</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="6.18">right now I believe the end of 2019</text>
  <text start="664.809" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the gold price start to</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="8.13">move up quite a bit in 2020 more so why</text>
  <text start="671.529" dur="6.99">because during this whole period of time</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="7.259">I believe central banks of all different</text>
  <text start="678.519" dur="6.661">countries will be purchasing gold once</text>
  <text start="682.689" dur="3.601">they have what they have and this is</text>
  <text start="685.18" dur="3.06">what they can purchase</text>
  <text start="686.29" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna want the gold price</text>
  <text start="688.24" dur="4.31">to start to move up and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="5.01">start to see this</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="5.98">which means gold is going</text>
  <text start="695.86" dur="5.1">to increase in value of course if you</text>
  <text start="698.53" dur="5.13">compare it to dollars the dollar is</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="6.15">gonna look worse and worse as time goes</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="6.87">on the stock market is going to stay up</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="4.56">for quite a while and this way Trump can</text>
  <text start="710.53" dur="5.31">use the statistical statistical</text>
  <text start="711.67" dur="6.57">information of GDP unemployment look at</text>
  <text start="715.84" dur="6.3">the stock market to show the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="718.24" dur="10.32">doing very very well until the election</text>
  <text start="722.14" dur="9.18">time now the Fed might raise rates right</text>
  <text start="728.56" dur="6.03">before the elections will this bring</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="5.34">down the economy now they might raise</text>
  <text start="734.59" dur="4.44">the rates because Trump during this</text>
  <text start="736.66" dur="4.08">period of time might even bring down the</text>
