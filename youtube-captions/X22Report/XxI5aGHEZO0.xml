  <text start="182.459" dur="7.321">how do you start pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="3.96">the Fed is responsible for everything</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="4.71">well he&amp;#39;s already started that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.16">number one he&amp;#39;s contradicted the Fed and</text>

  <text start="206.43" dur="5.64">be making this push it&amp;#39;s almost the same</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="5.28">approach that he&amp;#39;s using and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="5.07">just saying he the Patriots are using to</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="4.83">get rid of the deep state every day they</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="4.59">drop more breadcrumbs they let</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.769">information out so people start to</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="3.93">scratch their heads and they say well</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="4.141">what&amp;#39;s up with the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="4.889">what&amp;#39;s up with these people are they</text>

  <text start="234.48" dur="4.77">what Trump is doing right now with the</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="4.47">Fed and now he&amp;#39;s taking a step further</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="4.44">and we could see from the mainstream</text>

  <text start="267.99" dur="6.75">wreak havoc on the financial markets</text>
  <text start="271.1" dur="8.74">Trump could face uphill battle in trying</text>

  <text start="303.66" dur="6.42">in and changing what the Fed looks like</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="3.81">remember there was an article out there</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="4.619">saying that central banks are very</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="5.19">worried about their independence the</text>

  <text start="330.63" dur="5.16">acting chief of staff he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="4.949">saying that Trump realizes that he</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="5.129">doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability to fire Powell</text>
  <text start="337.889" dur="4.821">and he&amp;#39;s saying that listen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.919" dur="5.371">really think he&amp;#39;s going to do it and</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="7.66">there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about now of</text>
  <text start="346.29" dur="7.379">course we know this not to be true how</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="5.79">do we know this well if we look at the</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="2.911">Federal Reserve Act there&amp;#39;s something in</text>
  <text start="356.16" dur="5.43">there</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="8.91">in Section 10 that will allow the</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="6.51">President to remove the Fed chair now</text>

  <text start="370.68" dur="5.97">matter the message has been put out</text>
  <text start="373.139" dur="8.28">there and the mainstream media is trying</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="8.699">to figure out a way to project into the</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="7.981">future of why he can&amp;#39;t do this if you</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="6.421">read the Federal Reserve Act and this is</text>

  <text start="477.32" dur="7.34">Reserve now remember the Act doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="6.87">define the word cause but Congress</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="4.54">clearly thought the US president should</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="3.6">be able to remove board members before</text>

  <text start="638.75" dur="5.52">this is July 30th 2013 and this is very</text>
  <text start="642.2" dur="5.42">interesting Trump tweeted out the</text>

  <text start="692.17" dur="8.49">many many years ago we&amp;#39;re on a path</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="7.12">where the Fed will be taking down this</text>
