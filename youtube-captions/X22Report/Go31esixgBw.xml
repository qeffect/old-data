  <text start="30.31" dur="4.8">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="33.73" dur="3.87">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.11" dur="5.64">episode 838 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="37.6" dur="5.58">December 9 2015 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="40.75" dur="4.5">episode is the economy is in full</text>
  <text start="43.18" dur="4.769">recovery that US government would never</text>
  <text start="45.25" dur="5.25">lie to you let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="47.949" dur="3.991">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="50.5" dur="3.239">yesterday I talked about how the</text>
  <text start="51.94" dur="6.6">government continually lies to the</text>
  <text start="53.739" dur="6.39">people and they&amp;#39;re telling the world and</text>
  <text start="58.54" dur="4.939">especially the people in the United</text>
  <text start="60.129" dur="5.641">States that we are in a recovery and</text>
  <text start="63.479" dur="4.451">they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="65.77" dur="4.529">fine unemployment is at 5% it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="67.93" dur="4.59">even lower and all those people that</text>
  <text start="70.299" dur="4.771">falling off the unemployment they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="72.52" dur="3.87">really don&amp;#39;t want work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.07" dur="3.78">trying to convince us that the housing</text>
  <text start="76.39" dur="7.049">market the retail market it&amp;#39;s all fine</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="8.85">and when we go back in time we see</text>
  <text start="83.439" dur="6.241">things are not what they seem now I</text>
  <text start="87.7" dur="3.63">looked at this many many times and I</text>
  <text start="89.68" dur="6.539">decided you know what let&amp;#39;s see how much</text>
  <text start="91.33" dur="11.579">we actually spent on Black Friday going</text>
  <text start="96.219" dur="9">back to 2011 going to 2012 2013 2014 to</text>
  <text start="102.909" dur="4.231">the present and what was the actual</text>
  <text start="105.219" dur="5.521">unemployment numbers during that time</text>
  <text start="107.14" dur="8.88">period so we should see as more and more</text>
  <text start="110.74" dur="6.839">people get jobs we should see people out</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="4.409">there spending more money because</text>
  <text start="117.579" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re secure in their jobs they found</text>
  <text start="120.429" dur="4.65">jobs and the unemployment is continually</text>
  <text start="123.249" dur="6.721">dropping so if we go back to Black</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="8.671">Friday on 2011 there was a record of 50</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="5.73">2.4 billion that was spent now over the</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="4.44">year I averaged out the unemployment and</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="4.68">it was around 9% in the months of</text>
  <text start="138.19" dur="4.55">November and December unemployment was</text>
  <text start="140.38" dur="9.36">in November 8.6 percent</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="10.54">December 8.5% ok in black on black</text>
  <text start="149.74" dur="7.17">friday on 2012 let&amp;#39;s look at the total</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="6.539">spending it increased from 59 point 1</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="5.67">billion i&amp;#39;m from fifty two point four</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="4.351">billion to 59 point 1 billion now the</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="4.14">unemployment for that year</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="7.86">rigid it out there was about 8% November</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="10.58">was 7.7% December 7.9% that seems about</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="7.86">right yes more people are employed and</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="7.87">more people are spending money seems</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="8.72">fair and then something strange in 2013</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="6.599">on Black Friday the total amount spent</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="5.44">dropped to fifty seven point four</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="6.661">billion now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="194.05" dur="7.83">that the unemployment rate averaged out</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="5.4">for that year at 7.5% November was at</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="3.53">seven percent December it dropped down</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="7.95">to 6.7%</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="11.92">so we had the amount drop Black Friday</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="9.95">2014 we see the total spending has now</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="6.78">dropped to fifty point nine billion</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="5.86">unemployment averaging out that year is</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="7.74">around 66% November was five point eight</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="7.86">December five point six so now the</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="10.28">amount being spent in retail is dropping</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="8.94">and there are more people employed which</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="5.77">really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense at this</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="5.849">point because prior to this when we look</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="6.3">at those years that were actually</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="6.391">recovering we saw the opposite happen so</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.339">that brings us up to Black Friday of</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="6.03">this year and Thanksgiving and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.539" dur="4.831">already reporting that this number is</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="6.03">going to be around forty five billion or</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="6.359">so and this is an estimate at this point</text>
  <text start="268.69" dur="3.45">and it might even be lower than that</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="4.891">because usually their estimates are</text>
  <text start="272.14" dur="6.51">higher but the average unemployment is</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="5.69">at five point three percent for the year</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.73">and in November it&amp;#39;s at five percent</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="4.87">December we don&amp;#39;t know yet but we know</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s going to least be five percent</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="3.87">it might even drop to four point nine to</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="4.25">round out the year to say wow what an</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="7.739">incredible year so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="5.32">unemployment is falling and sales for</text>
  <text start="297.789" dur="2.731">the</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="7.23">holiday season is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="8.55">worse as time goes on so somebody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="7.7">lying here now these numbers were taken</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="6.69">from the National Retail Federation and</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="4.45">the unemployment numbers were taken from</text>
  <text start="315.76" dur="5.31">the government these are their official</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="7.47">numbers so something&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="6.24">that isn&amp;#39;t correct and the number of</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="5.94">shoppers that are actually out there</text>
  <text start="327.31" dur="5.28">shopping has decreased also now everyone</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="5.46">goes oh must be the online sales well</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="6">guess what the online sales do not make</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="5.91">up the difference that is being lost</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="6.54">here because each year for online sales</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="7.229">it&amp;#39;s around anywhere from 9 to 15</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="5.849">billion and it really doesn&amp;#39;t counter</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="6.66">what is really going on here because</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="9.861">during the year of 2012 and 2013 online</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="8.011">sales were pretty much the same 2014</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="6.01">very close to being that same 10 billion</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="3.96">number and this year very close for</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="5.22">being the timba so that&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="7.41">constant at this point and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="6.84">seeing right now is that this whole</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="9.769">thing that they&amp;#39;re trying to convince of</text>
  <text start="378.91" dur="6.379">it convinced us of is a complete lie</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="8.591">more and more people are not working</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="5.56">more and more people are out of a job if</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="6.65">we go to Challenger Gray and Christmas</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="9.091">who are reporting how many people are</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="8.41">being laid off we are approaching from</text>
  <text start="405.19" dur="6.93">June of 2014 to December of 2015 a</text>
  <text start="409" dur="8.16">million people and there are more and</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="8.1">more layoffs that are occurring and when</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="6.75">we look around at real estate we see</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="8.759">lumber prices dropping while</text>
  <text start="423.91" dur="6.69">construction is increasing demand for</text>
  <text start="428.979" dur="4.471">lumber is dropping</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="3.78">as construction is increasing of course</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="3.74">this is what the government is telling</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="7.65">us that the construction is increasing</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="8.41">so something again is not right the</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="5.82">mortgage applications are in a downward</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="4.23">trend actually most of the banks and</text>
  <text start="447.85" dur="4.31">financial institutions have laid off</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="4.29">most of their mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="452.16" dur="4.09">thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="5.52">because they knew the people would be</text>
  <text start="456.25" dur="6.27">out of work and they couldn&amp;#39;t take out</text>
  <text start="459.64" dur="6.09">mortgages why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="6.09">modifying how you can get a mortgage at</text>
  <text start="465.73" dur="4.98">this time it&amp;#39;s not because the economy</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="3.9">is doing well it&amp;#39;s not because people</text>
  <text start="470.71" dur="4.32">are making an incredible amount of money</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="4.23">and they have great credit it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="3.48">people have bad credit people can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="3.99">jobs people have part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="480.73" dur="4.29">bring more and more people into the</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="3.6">market to blow up the bubble it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.02" dur="3.75">happening in the auto loan industry and</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s happening in the housing industry</text>
  <text start="488.77" dur="5.31">and this is why we see all these</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="5.24">modifications why in the world would the</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="7.47">government have to modify student loans</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="7.09">and the way they&amp;#39;re modifying it is how</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.23">much you&amp;#39;re making because if everyone</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="3.54">coming out of college is finding this</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="3.27">fantastic job like the president is</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.65">telling us because unemployment is a</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="6.299">five percent they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="7.59">continually modify millions and millions</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="6.301">and millions of student loans it</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="6">wouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary because if we go</text>
  <text start="521.65" dur="6.6">back in time during a recovery during a</text>
  <text start="525.58" dur="4.59">period like this where unemployment was</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="4.68">at five percent four point nine four</text>
  <text start="530.17" dur="8.04">point eight we didn&amp;#39;t have any of this</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="10.31">it wasn&amp;#39;t needed but today it is needed</text>
  <text start="538.21" dur="8.93">because this is a fake phony economy and</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re pumping it up pumping it up</text>
  <text start="547.14" dur="5.89">until the last minute when the whole</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="5.73">thing come crumbling down now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.03" dur="7.38">getting other indicators that the market</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="7.29">the economic market is not doing well we</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="3.929">see October wholesale inventories have</text>
  <text start="562.45" dur="3.509">dropped by 0.1 percent</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="4.86">they miss their expectations of point</text>
  <text start="565.959" dur="6.661">two so inventory to sales ratio is at</text>
  <text start="569.199" dur="7.041">one point three one right now this is</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="7.11">post crisis highs now if we look at the</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="7.17">inventory to sales ratio and we go back</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="7.079">in time back to 2001 when we had Oh a</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="7.75">recession that number was at one point</text>
  <text start="586.809" dur="8.07">three five when we look at 2008 that</text>
  <text start="591.16" dur="6.989">number hit one point four we are now at</text>
  <text start="594.879" dur="7.671">one point three one we&amp;#39;ve already hit</text>
  <text start="598.149" dur="8.85">that area and it&amp;#39;s continually trending</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="8.38">upward the Baltic Dry Index has fallen</text>
  <text start="606.999" dur="6.721">once again down to 546 this is the raw</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="6.36">material that factories used to create</text>
  <text start="613.72" dur="8.279">the goods and we know manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="617.29" dur="8.789">in complete decline at this time we see</text>
  <text start="621.999" dur="6.68">that the last time oil plunged below</text>
  <text start="626.079" dur="5.341">thirty eight dollars a barrel guess what</text>
  <text start="628.679" dur="8.35">it was back during the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="9.509">and in 2008 right now the US oil is</text>
  <text start="637.029" dur="6.98">around thirty seven and change nations</text>
  <text start="640.929" dur="5.76">such as Japan Canada Brazil and Russia</text>
  <text start="644.009" dur="3.94">they plunged into recession actually</text>
  <text start="646.689" dur="5.27">with just getting reports now that</text>
  <text start="647.949" dur="7.08">Russia is coming out of the recession</text>
  <text start="651.959" dur="5.8">more than half of all major global stock</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="6">market market indexes are down at least</text>
  <text start="657.759" dur="6.75">ten percent year-to-date and it looks</text>
  <text start="661.029" dur="6.5">like opec is going to produce and push</text>
  <text start="664.509" dur="6.661">out even more oil and some are even</text>
  <text start="667.529" dur="7.23">predicting that the price per barrel is</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="9.12">going to go to thirty twenty five and</text>
  <text start="674.759" dur="11.05">maybe even twenty so this is a huge huge</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="8.13">problem so what else happened that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.809" dur="4.77">happening right now when we had the</text>
  <text start="688.42" dur="6.779">Great Depression the Great Recession</text>

  <text start="695.199" dur="2.971">not really junk they simply have a</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="2.669">higher risk</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="4.83">thus a higher return than other bonds of</text>

  <text start="703" dur="4.529">crash you would expect to see a junk</text>
  <text start="705.37" dur="4.589">bond crash first this happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="707.529" dur="6.721">and it is happening again right now</text>
  <text start="709.959" dur="8.151">Monday a high-yield bond etf known as</text>
