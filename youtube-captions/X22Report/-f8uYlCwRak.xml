  <text start="56.54" dur="5.07">eatery pour my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.22" dur="6.39">episode 1658 and today&amp;#39;s date is August</text>
  <text start="61.61" dur="6.27">28th 2018 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.61" dur="6.36">this has been planned years ago to rid</text>
  <text start="67.88" dur="4.89">the country of our controllers let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.97" dur="5.97">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.77" dur="8.28">news now what we are seeing here is two</text>
  <text start="76.94" dur="6.21">sides to the same exact story on one</text>
  <text start="81.05" dur="4.98">side we have the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="83.15" dur="6.03">are out there telling us how the economy</text>
  <text start="86.03" dur="5.82">is slowing the real estate market we</text>
  <text start="89.18" dur="5.46">might go into a housing crisis maybe in</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="4.89">2020 or recession in 2020 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.64" dur="5.91">saying that tariffs are going to be bad</text>
  <text start="96.74" dur="6.9">for this country now yes the economy is</text>
  <text start="100.55" dur="4.77">not doing well yes we see the numbers</text>
  <text start="103.64" dur="3.42">out there like GDP and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s manipulated to make us believe that</text>
  <text start="107.06" dur="4.169">the economy is doing well this is being</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="5.399">done on purpose this has been planned a</text>
  <text start="111.229" dur="6.091">long time ago because those who are in</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="4.53">control right now realized that</text>
  <text start="117.32" dur="4.68">eventually we were going to have to get</text>
  <text start="119.149" dur="5.161">rid of the central bank and the only way</text>
  <text start="122" dur="5.58">to do this was at the point in time</text>
  <text start="124.31" dur="7.56">where their system completely breaks</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="6.87">down and once it does break down they</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="5.61">will have the ability to transition us</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.58">into a new system and you can then start</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="5.22">calling the controller&amp;#39;s out which is</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="4.38">the central bank and say let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="4.59">look at what you&amp;#39;ve been doing over the</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="6.24">many many years to see why our system</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="6.21">continually crashes and this is what is</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="5.04">happening right now now the plan is to</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="6.45">make it look like the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="8.1">fantastically meanwhile the entire</text>
  <text start="159.95" dur="6.99">operation is to prepare the United</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="5.76">States for what comes after and what</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="6">comes after is an economy without the</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="4.8">central banking system that is the plan</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="4.26">and this plan has been in place for a</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="5.9">very long time and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="6.42">economy right now it is completely</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="6.459">breaking down</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="5.369">and this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.14">remember there are two narratives to the</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="4.17">story there&amp;#39;s the central banking</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="4.5">narrative and then there&amp;#39;s the patriot</text>
  <text start="193.159" dur="5.101">narrative and the patriot Navarrete</text>
  <text start="195.349" dur="5.31">narrative has to be in control when the</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="4.68">system comes down they need to blame the</text>
  <text start="200.659" dur="5.311">central bank and those who were in</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="5.85">control for the many many years this way</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="4.71">they can order in audit this way they</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.05">can look into the dealings of the</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="4.73">Federal Reserve and they can start</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="5.13">opening it up and looking at it and</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="5.32">presenting it to the public and showing</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="4.349">them this is why we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="5.67">the central bank and convincing the</text>
  <text start="222.319" dur="7.2">states to pass a law that says we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="6.03">need the central bank anymore and we see</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="5.161">already that we are headed down this</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="5.52">path now the economy is breaking down</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="5.76">and the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="4.709">to use this to try to shift it and blame</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.889">it on the tariffs on the trade war on</text>
  <text start="242.659" dur="4.08">the new deals that Trump is doing now</text>
  <text start="245.329" dur="3.481">remember these bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="4.86">agreements are being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s getting rid of the globalist system</text>
  <text start="251.599" dur="4.32">and setting us up so we can bring</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="4.17">manufacturing back to United States now</text>
  <text start="255.919" dur="4.56">they realized that they can&amp;#39;t bring it</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="4.98">all back at this point in time right now</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="4.981">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible but they can</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="4.71">lay the foundation of how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="4.709">to bring it back for later on and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="4.35">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now and when we</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="3.301">start to look at many of the different</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="3.569">economic sectors we can see that</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="4.71">everything is really starting to break</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="5.88">down right now and we see that the US</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="7.26">housing market it is headed for the</text>
  <text start="281.419" dur="6.511">broadest slowdown in years housing</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.949">prices have been pumped up so high they</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="4.669">are too high and people just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="290.389" dur="5.221">afford them right now</text>
  <text start="292.599" dur="5.141">now of course rising prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="4.23">supposed to be fantastic for the</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="5.28">everyday person because when the prices</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="4.38">of homes rise people feel great the</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="3.959">economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="6.12">well if the economy is not manipulated</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="5.791">and everything is organic yes this would</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="5.85">work out but when you blow up a bubble</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="4.03">and you create the housing market where</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="3.52">the</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.26">housing prices are so high and the wages</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="4.889">are continually dropping and people</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="6.12">can&amp;#39;t find jobs that is a whole nother</text>
  <text start="324.599" dur="4.951">story according to a new report from the</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="5.1">National Association of Realtors prices</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="6.06">for starter homes are the highest they</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="5.009">have been since 2008 now just prior to</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="4.92">the collapse of the housing market in</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="6.181">2008 Ben Bernanke was out there and he</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="5.609">said there is no housing bubble and that</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="5.24">we&amp;#39;ve never had a decline in house</text>
  <text start="346.139" dur="6.03">prices on a nationwide basis and</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="6.04">therefore we&amp;#39;ll never have one and then</text>
  <text start="352.169" dur="5.25">what happened the opposite of what he</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="7.259">was telling us that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="6.78">happen once again remember the central</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="3.9">banking system they are never going to</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="3.301">tell us what&amp;#39;s really going on and</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="3.48">whenever they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="367.5" dur="5.669">everything is great the economy strong</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="5.611">it is always the opposite now when we</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="6.9">look at the housing prices what do we</text>
  <text start="375" dur="7.83">see well first time buyers needed 23</text>
  <text start="380.069" dur="6">percent of their income in order to</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="5.94">afford a typical entry-level home this</text>
  <text start="386.069" dur="6.57">was up from 21 percent in the year prior</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="6.389">and the highest in the past decade this</text>
  <text start="392.639" dur="4.471">of course should surprise nobody as</text>
  <text start="395.159" dur="4.831">price gains in the housing market have</text>
  <text start="397.11" dur="5.13">long outpaced wages in fact in most</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="5.419">markets the average home price increase</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="6.78">is double the growth in hourly earnings</text>
  <text start="405.409" dur="7.12">so how in the world is someone going to</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="6.239">afford a home it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="412.529" dur="4.98">and then we if we look at you know San</text>
  <text start="415.259" dur="4.981">Francisco New York we can see that a</text>
  <text start="417.509" dur="5.701">household needs 65 percent of its income</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="5.399">to buy a house there if we look at Los</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="6.389">Angeles and Miami you need between 59</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="5.851">and 55 percent and when we really look</text>
  <text start="429.599" dur="3.81">at these markets the only people that</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="5.16">can afford these types of homes is the</text>
  <text start="433.409" dur="5.13">point zero one percent and of course</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="5.129">what has happened over time the wealth</text>
  <text start="438.539" dur="5.31">has been funneled to the point zero one</text>
  <text start="441.779" dur="4.681">percent and this is what we see when a</text>
  <text start="443.849" dur="4.32">central banking system comes to its end</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="3.569">cycle and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="2.431">right now Case Shiller is out there</text>
  <text start="450.029" dur="2.431">remember they</text>
  <text start="450.6" dur="3.78">20 different cities in those cities the</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="4.02">bubbles have been inflated like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.38" dur="5.94">no tomorrow but what we&amp;#39;re seeing at</text>
  <text start="456.48" dur="8.64">this point is that home prices they have</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="10.29">dropped by six point three one percent</text>
  <text start="465.12" dur="10.41">year-on-year this is the weakest since</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="7.2">December of 2017 and we know that new</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="4.35">and existing homes they are flat over</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="3.39">the last six months and when we start to</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="4.71">look at all this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="481.2" dur="5.49">housing market is going into a time</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="5.82">period where there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="6.96">of trouble we see that the student loan</text>
  <text start="490.41" dur="6.15">official has quit blaming Trump warns</text>

  <text start="523.59" dur="7.86">do you have to take out debt this again</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="7.88">is a central banking system it is</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="7.89">designed to put everyone into debt</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="6.31">credit card debt auto debt student loan</text>
  <text start="539.34" dur="4.95">debt you name it</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="6.42">mortgage debt you name it you are in</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="6.69">debt one way or another this is how a</text>

  <text start="557.52" dur="7.5">become wealthy that will make it in this</text>
  <text start="561.02" dur="7.99">environment but think about it the mass</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="6.72">of people who are not that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="7.14">system is designed to do to keep the</text>
  <text start="571.74" dur="6.87">masses at a lower level to continually</text>
  <text start="576.15" dur="6.21">have them work and work and work and</text>
  <text start="578.61" dur="5.78">never get out of that debt and for each</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="3.71">generation it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="6.06">and worse I hear a lot of people say you</text>
  <text start="586.07" dur="7.17">know who were working in their 20s or it</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="5.13">were 30s in the 70s going into the 80s</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="3.81">saying listen I&amp;#39;m retiring I really</text>
  <text start="595.58" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t have that much debt I have a</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="4.71">pension yes you have to remember how</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="4.83">this system is designed in the beginning</text>
  <text start="601.76" dur="3.93">phase there&amp;#39;s not that much debt in the</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="4.83">beginning phase if you start out there</text>
  <text start="605.69" dur="6.06">most likely you will be fine but as each</text>
  <text start="608.9" dur="5.37">generation comes into the system it gets</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="5.19">worse and worse and worse here we are at</text>
  <text start="614.27" dur="5.4">the end cycle of this system and most of</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="5.13">the people can&amp;#39;t even get by they have a</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="5.46">very difficult time trying to buy a</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="5.85">house get a car without taking out a</text>
  <text start="625.13" dur="4.86">loan yes if you go back to the 70s back</text>
  <text start="627.92" dur="3.96">then when the dollar was worth a lot</text>
  <text start="629.99" dur="4.11">more you were able to pay cash for</text>
  <text start="631.88" dur="5.07">things you were able to pay cash for a</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="5.27">car you were able to go out and use cash</text>
  <text start="636.95" dur="4.65">to buy clothing and other goods today</text>
  <text start="639.37" dur="4.57">most people have to purchase everything</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="4.35">on credit because the value of the</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="4.14">dollar has decreased which means you</text>
  <text start="645.95" dur="6.99">need a lot more of them to pay for the</text>
  <text start="648.08" dur="6.95">same exact products and here we are and</text>
  <text start="652.94" dur="4.49">we&amp;#39;re starting to see individuals in</text>
  <text start="655.03" dur="5.47">different departments within government</text>
  <text start="657.43" dur="5.41">resign why because there&amp;#39;s major</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="4.61">corruption and they&amp;#39;re getting out</text>
  <text start="662.84" dur="7.95">before everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="665.11" dur="8.65">now remember the entire system was built</text>
  <text start="670.79" dur="4.68">and designed to be a global system and</text>
  <text start="673.76" dur="6.27">yesterday we talked about NAFTA how</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="6.06">Trump now has this new trade agreement</text>
  <text start="680.03" dur="2.04">with Mexico he doesn&amp;#39;t call it NAFTA</text>
  <text start="681.53" dur="3.72">anymore</text>
  <text start="682.07" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s the us-mexico deal and there are</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="3.32">many different points here and I just</text>
  <text start="686.6" dur="5.63">want to go over some of these once again</text>
  <text start="688.57" dur="6.64">when we look at the NAFTA loophole</text>
  <text start="692.23" dur="6.67">remember it was about hourly wages is it</text>
  <text start="695.21" dur="5.67">exactly where we want it to be not as of</text>
  <text start="698.9" dur="3.72">yet but it&amp;#39;s a lot better than it was I</text>
  <text start="700.88" dur="3.57">mean he tried to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="702.62" dur="3.33">altogether but realize that Congress</text>
