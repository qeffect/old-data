  <text start="54.71" dur="6.12">episode 1214 and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="58.01" dur="5.729">februari 26 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="60.83" dur="6.03">episode is more states are now bypassing</text>
  <text start="63.739" dur="5.461">the Fed with gold legislation let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="4.17">right into the economic collapse news in</text>
  <text start="69.2" dur="5.34">the past couple of months we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="6.33">many states come out and say that gold</text>
  <text start="74.54" dur="4.95">is money even had Greenspan out there</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="4.74">saying that you should own gold as an</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="4.98">insurance policy and we can see that</text>
  <text start="82.1" dur="6.44">there are more and more states coming up</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="6.929">with legislation to move that gold</text>
  <text start="88.54" dur="4.57">agenda forward now the framers of our</text>
  <text start="91.399" dur="4.441">nation established that the gold and</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="4.77">silver while their money but federal</text>
  <text start="95.84" dur="4.889">taxing authorities in recent decades</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="5.31">have required taxpayers to pay taxes on</text>
  <text start="100.729" dur="6.181">this form of money when it exchanged for</text>
  <text start="103.19" dur="5.459">the Federal Reserve notes which results</text>
  <text start="106.91" dur="3.84">in nominal capital gains but that</text>
  <text start="108.649" dur="4.261">problem may soon completely disappear</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="4.74">and we can see states like Utah Texas</text>
  <text start="112.91" dur="4.8">Arizona they&amp;#39;re passing legislation now</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s another state out there Idaho</text>
  <text start="117.71" dur="4.44">and a state representative has advanced</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="4.979">legislation to remove state income taxes</text>
  <text start="122.15" dur="5.039">when Idaho taxpayers sell their precious</text>
  <text start="124.909" dur="5.011">metals House Majority Leader Mike moil</text>
  <text start="127.189" dur="6.121">introduced house bill 206 on februari</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="4.83">23rd to amend Idaho&amp;#39;s revenue statutes</text>
  <text start="133.31" dur="4.53">providing the capital gains and losses</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="5.25">on precious metals bullion and monetize</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="5.76">billion cells be added to or subtracted</text>
  <text start="140" dur="5.79">from Idaho taxable income similar to a</text>
  <text start="143.6" dur="6.6">bill recently passed by Arizona State</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="6.99">House Idaho&amp;#39;s HB 206 is a pure and tax</text>
  <text start="150.2" dur="4.2">neutral proposal that&amp;#39;s because both</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="3.81">precious metal gains and losses are</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.19">backed out of the calculation of one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="4.17">Idaho taxable income and by removing</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="3.36">precious metals from the state income</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="4.319">tax Idaho can stop compounding the</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="4.49">problem instead help promote the</text>
  <text start="165.079" dur="4.801">adoption and widespread use of</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="4.57">constitutional money and we can see</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="5.19">right now that there are many financial</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="5.49">pundants many states that are looking at</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="5.52">the situation right now and realizing</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="5.819">that we need real money we need real</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="6.149">money to protect ourselves again</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="6.93">against the Fayette currency system now</text>
  <text start="186.739" dur="5.76">Allen Zimbabwe we see that the US dollar</text>
  <text start="190.249" dur="4.231">is disappearance from their banking</text>
  <text start="192.499" dur="4.11">system and when we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="194.48" dur="4.459">that transactional activity in Zimbabwe</text>
  <text start="196.609" dur="4.38">in recent weeks indicates a slow</text>
  <text start="198.939" dur="5.17">disappearance of the United States</text>
  <text start="200.989" dur="5.25">dollar which is being replaced by bond</text>
  <text start="204.109" dur="4.77">notes now the bomb notes were introduced</text>
  <text start="206.239" dur="4.98">last year under the 200 million export</text>
  <text start="208.879" dur="5.01">incentive to supplement dwindling dollar</text>
  <text start="211.219" dur="5.281">supplies due to weak exports now there</text>
  <text start="213.889" dur="4.861">was a time in the past where they would</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="3.599">go to ATM machines and other and bangs</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="4.439">and things like that where they were</text>
  <text start="220.099" dur="5.161">they would receive US dollars and bond</text>
  <text start="223.189" dur="4.351">notes and now most of the people in</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="4.05">Zimbabwe are saying they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="4.919">finding dollars anymore they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="6.09">receiving the bond note instead of US</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="5.9">dollars now starbucks was out there and</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="6.959">with this whole entire immigration</text>
  <text start="238.359" dur="6.401">agenda starbucks came out CEO Howard</text>
  <text start="242.359" dur="4.44">Schultz he decided to take the stand in</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="4.559">defiance of trumps immigration executive</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="5.071">order and he went out there and he said</text>
  <text start="249.319" dur="4.32">that they&amp;#39;re going to be hiring 10,000</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="4.859">refugees over the next five years to</text>
  <text start="253.639" dur="5.52">build bridges not walls with Mexico well</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="4.711">unfortunately Schultz quickly found out</text>
  <text start="259.159" dur="5.611">the hard way that while most Americans</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="5.729">can agree they like the coffee roughly</text>
  <text start="264.77" dur="4.56">fifty percent disagree with his</text>
  <text start="267.169" dur="4.951">political opinions and according to</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="6.45">Yahoo Finance well it looks like brand</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="8.639">perception is in a downward spiral and</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="7.59">there was a poll done by yougov call</text>
  <text start="280.759" dur="5.371">brand index and you can see at the point</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="5.31">where he announced this well things</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="5.339">dropped off dramatically now at the same</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="5.82">time when starbucks announced hiring</text>
  <text start="291.469" dur="5.461">immigrants black rifle coffee said well</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="5.58">instead of doing what starbucks says</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="6.239">we&amp;#39;re going to hire veterans people who</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="5.67">fought for this country Americans who</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="4.68">fought for this country and when I look</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.07">at what Starbucks says why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="307.849" dur="6.031">dot hire Americans that don&amp;#39;t have work</text>
  <text start="310.82" dur="5.159">so you&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re bypassing Americans</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="3.28">that are looking for jobs and instead</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="3.881">they&amp;#39;re going to hire</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="6.06">immigrants who are just coming into this</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="6.36">country and I can see why the perception</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="4.47">of Starbucks has declined since that</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="5.1">announcement because it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="6.93">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to push here now</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="6.66">on college campuses we see there is a</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="5.97">certain agenda within the college</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="4.2">structure Adam Steinberg of the</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="3.54">washington examiner has been</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="4.02">investigating different colleges and</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s found that administrators are</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="5.43">encouraging students to snitch on each</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="5.1">other and their professors not to expose</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="4.74">chronal behavior or cheating no nothing</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="6.33">like that but to target inappropriate</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="6.12">speech he found that 230 colleges have</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="4.83">what are called bias response teams</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.1">which are made up of either campus cops</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="5.43">or administrators whose sole job is to</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="5.49">investigate mostly anonymous claims of</text>
  <text start="370.29" dur="4.89">offensive speech and as you might expect</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="5.25">these schools to find buys an extremely</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="4.65">vague and subjective terms the students</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="3.36">and professors who are ratted out are</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="3.99">usually reprimanded by administrators</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="4.41">and forced to endure conversations of</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="5.7">the civil rights moving and how their</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="6.18">words hurt others now again freedom of</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="5.399">speech well you could say whatever you</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="4.86">want and if someone is offended well</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re offended they might speak out</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="4.44">and say yes I&amp;#39;m offended but you cannot</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="4.11">stop the person I&amp;#39;m saying it because</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="4.05">once you stop the person from saying it</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="5.25">well then you&amp;#39;re permitting speech it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="5.43">not free and guess what something that</text>
  <text start="408.81" dur="3.96">offends one person might not send in</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="4.53">another but that&amp;#39;s the whole purpose of</text>
  <text start="412.77" dur="7.04">free speech to say what you&amp;#39;re feeling</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="7.02">to say what&amp;#39;s on your mind to speak out</text>
  <text start="419.81" dur="5.95">against the authorities to speak out</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="6.03">against government and once people are</text>
  <text start="425.76" dur="5.4">out there telling you can or cannot say</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="5.76">certain words you can or cannot say</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="6.75">certain phrases it might hurt someone</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="5.94">well now you&amp;#39;re controlling speech and</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="4.95">this is what colleges are doing today</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="6.09">this is what they&amp;#39;re teaching our young</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="6.15">and if we look back in time you can see</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="4.5">how things are dramatically changing</text>
  <text start="449.01" dur="4.23">where everyone on the boat they</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.04">ball team wins a trophy there are no</text>
  <text start="453.24" dur="4.86">losers and when real life happens and</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="4.83">there is a loser well that individual</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="5.49">breaks down think about bowling they put</text>
  <text start="460.8" dur="5.399">up the side panels so the kid can never</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="5.699">get a gutter ball what in life there are</text>
  <text start="466.199" dur="5.94">gutter balls it does happen and we can</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="5.581">see by protecting the youth and not</text>
  <text start="472.139" dur="6.421">letting them experience hearing certain</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="6.63">things losing well we&amp;#39;re setting up a</text>
  <text start="478.56" dur="6.09">generation of individuals that will not</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="6.09">be able to handle real life scenarios</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="4.739">and when a real-life scenario is thrown</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="3.84">at them they&amp;#39;ll completely break down</text>
  <text start="489.389" dur="5.28">and that&amp;#39;s actually what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="5.76">today now in North Korea we understand</text>
  <text start="494.669" dur="5.461">that Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s half brother was</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="5.43">murdered now North Korea they are</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="4.77">looking at the situation the United</text>
  <text start="502.62" dur="4.5">States is looking at the situation the</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="6.259">Malaysian police are looking at the</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="7.71">situation and they arrested a woman CT I</text>
  <text start="511.159" dur="6.281">ISA an Indonesian woman welp she&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="514.83" dur="5.009">held in Malaysia for poisoning Kim Jong</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="4.08">Un&amp;#39;s half-brother now she is out there</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.2">saying that she got paid ninety dollars</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="4.259">for the attack which she believed to</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="4.651">have been a prank and this is what she</text>
  <text start="525.779" dur="5.131">said that somebody asked her to do this</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="4.26">activity she only said in general she</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="4.32">met with some people who look Japanese</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="4.889">or Korean she doesn&amp;#39;t really know and</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="5.82">the Malaysian police say that the baby</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="6.091">oil was in fact the VX a powerful poison</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="5.01">classified by the UN as a weapon of mass</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.88">destruction which is prohibitively</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="6.12">expensive and mostly manufactured in</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="6.79">state-sponsored military facilities now</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.76">she didn&amp;#39;t show any signs of problems</text>
  <text start="555.6" dur="4.29">handling the poison which is strange in</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="5.49">itself and then we have to ask the</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="6.96">question why all of a sudden did North</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="6.899">Korea want to kill Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s brother</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="6.15">why now why publicly to be seen</text>
  <text start="570.329" dur="4.981">worldwide on videotape think about this</text>
  <text start="573" dur="5.01">for a second who had motive and</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="4.71">opportunity to kill him if North Korean</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="4.38">authorities wanted him eliminated why</text>
  <text start="580.02" dur="4.59">did they wait so long why a public</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="4.35">execution making easy for it</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="4.83">tractors to automatically lay the blame</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="5.909">on North Korea does that make any sense</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="5.22">and then we also find out that there are</text>
  <text start="592.649" dur="4.081">reports that indicate North Korea plans</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="5.76">sending its foreign ministry director of</text>

  <text start="648.42" dur="5.25">itself the use of the chemical narrows</text>
  <text start="651.57" dur="6.449">the list of suspects think about this</text>

  <text start="677.43" dur="4.349">what they&amp;#39;re building up to now they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="706.05" dur="5.25">from nerves to muscles if acetylcholine</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="5.19">does not break down muscles stay</text>
  <text start="711.3" dur="4.979">helplessly contracted and victims die of</text>
  <text start="713.85" dur="4.32">paralyzed breathing they also go into</text>
  <text start="716.279" dur="3.631">convulsions they phone from the mouth</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="4.08">they turn blue and there are other</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="4.979">symptoms that go along with this now Kim</text>
  <text start="722.25" dur="4.889">himself is said to have reported liquid</text>
  <text start="724.889" dur="5.491">smeared on his face that burned his eyes</text>
  <text start="727.139" dur="4.981">when it when he went to the airport well</text>
  <text start="730.38" dur="3.6">this is why when the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="732.12" dur="3.69">out there reporting this is why he</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="3.299">couldn&amp;#39;t see now the attacker was</text>
  <text start="735.81" dur="4.44">handling the cloth with no apparent</text>
  <text start="737.279" dur="6">protection not wielding a syringe there</text>
  <text start="740.25" dur="4.079">then the report says and this is coming</text>
  <text start="743.279" dur="3">from the corporate media they went into</text>
  <text start="744.329" dur="4.051">the bathroom and they quickly wash their</text>
  <text start="746.279" dur="4.381">hands well they already would have</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="4.47">touched the liquid I mean it would have</text>
  <text start="750.66" dur="4.229">already gotten onto them but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="752.85" dur="5.039">said they&amp;#39;ve shown no signs or symptoms</text>
  <text start="754.889" dur="5.461">or anything when Kim jong-nam was put</text>
  <text start="757.889" dur="4.56">into the ambulance they didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="3.96">it was they were touching his face they</text>
  <text start="762.449" dur="3.69">were touching none of the ambulance</text>
  <text start="764.31" dur="3.719">individuals well they didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="766.139" dur="5.07">symptoms whatsoever which is kind of</text>
  <text start="768.029" dur="6.24">strange so yes the attackers maybe they</text>
  <text start="771.209" dur="5.43">were pretreated with atropine a drug</text>
  <text start="774.269" dur="4.711">that blocks the effects of VX okay will</text>
  <text start="776.639" dur="4.13">rule them out but the medical staff who</text>
  <text start="778.98" dur="4.53">handled him they would have been</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="4.901">pretreated with this because they had no</text>
  <text start="783.51" dur="4.88">idea what was going on with him and he</text>
  <text start="785.67" dur="6.659">was missing certain telltale signs</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="6.46">symptoms of the VX nerve agent which is</text>
  <text start="792.329" dur="5.581">all strange in itself now the question</text>
  <text start="794.85" dur="4.919">is who has the VX agent well US and</text>
  <text start="797.91" dur="4.35">Russia these are the only countries that</text>
  <text start="799.769" dur="3.901">have admitted owning VX stockpiles but</text>
  <text start="802.26" dur="3.93">there could be other countries that have</text>
  <text start="803.67" dur="4.26">it but just having a minute but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="806.19" dur="4.53">very hard to make because you can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="807.93" dur="7.349">the precursor chemicals but this whole</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="8.67">thing was a complete setup for pushing a</text>
  <text start="815.279" dur="5.581">certain agenda that is to basically stop</text>
  <text start="819.39" dur="3.54">the meeting with the u.s. and North</text>
  <text start="820.86" dur="4.349">Korea about denuclearization they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="4.889">want that to happen plus it&amp;#39;s setting up</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="5.431">North Korea to have chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="827.819" dur="4.5">because already South Korea came out to</text>
  <text start="830.64" dur="5.55">raise the issue of North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="832.319" dur="5.82">chemical weapons program and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="4.68">using it and they&amp;#39;re bringing this to</text>
  <text start="838.139" dur="5.281">the UN it sounds very similar to Syria</text>
  <text start="840.87" dur="4.079">where they went to the UN and Syria has</text>
  <text start="843.42" dur="3.12">chemical weapons they built the story up</text>
  <text start="844.949" dur="3.931">it looks like they&amp;#39;re using the same</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="4.9">narrative now on North Korea and we know</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="5.17">that China has pulled back they stopped</text>
  <text start="851.44" dur="4.71">importing the call from from North Korea</text>
  <text start="854.05" dur="3.84">which is going to damage the economy of</text>
  <text start="856.15" dur="4.89">North Korea and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="4.71">that the squeeze is on right now because</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="2.91">we know for a very long time United</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="3.99">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="863.95" dur="4.8">want a regime change inside of North</text>
  <text start="866.59" dur="3.93">Korea and it looks like this is what</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re pushing and hopefully they can</text>
  <text start="870.52" dur="5.07">get some type of war out of this now a</text>
  <text start="872.83" dur="5.28">top US general secretly visited Syria</text>
  <text start="875.59" dur="7.56">and Washington to dispatch more troops</text>
  <text start="878.11" dur="8.31">now general Votel he visited Syria right</text>
  <text start="883.15" dur="5.49">after McCain remember McCain went to</text>
  <text start="886.42" dur="4.41">Syria which is actually in violation of</text>
  <text start="888.64" dur="4.41">the Logan a key as a senator he is not</text>
  <text start="890.83" dur="4.68">part of the executive branch it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="893.05" dur="4.17">have permission to go over to Syria but</text>
  <text start="895.51" dur="4.2">we can see he was out there checking up</text>
  <text start="897.22" dur="5.1">on the Islamic state checking up on the</text>
  <text start="899.71" dur="4.62">moderate rebels casing out what has been</text>
  <text start="902.32" dur="4.44">done there and what the strength is of</text>
  <text start="904.33" dur="4.08">these paid mercenaries these terrorists</text>
  <text start="906.76" dur="4.08">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="908.41" dur="3.93">general is out there looking at the same</text>
  <text start="910.84" dur="3.06">thing because they want to bring in</text>
  <text start="912.34" dur="3.51">troops because they realize that paid</text>
  <text start="913.9" dur="4.23">mercenaries well they&amp;#39;re done for and</text>
  <text start="915.85" dur="5.49">the only way to get Assad out is to</text>
  <text start="918.13" dur="5.19">bring troops in Iraqi popular forces are</text>
  <text start="921.34" dur="4.47">saying well we have evidence that the</text>
  <text start="923.32" dur="4.83">u.s. right now is trying to evacuate the</text>
  <text start="925.81" dur="4.05">Islamic state commanders from the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="928.15" dur="2.73">city right outside muscle because we</text>
  <text start="929.86" dur="3.33">know what&amp;#39;s happening in the soul</text>
  <text start="930.88" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a huge offensive going on and</text>
  <text start="933.19" dur="4.38">the Iraqi forces and the US forces</text>
  <text start="935.11" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re taking back my soul and it looks</text>
  <text start="937.57" dur="6">like the Islamic state commanders moved</text>
  <text start="939.55" dur="7.38">out of muscle there in a town tau afar</text>
  <text start="943.57" dur="4.62">which is around misil and the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="946.93" dur="3.9">trying to get the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="948.19" dur="5.01">commanders out of the area so we can see</text>
  <text start="950.83" dur="5.25">what is happening right now the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="953.2" dur="4.86">still covertly supporting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="956.08" dur="4.65">state we see troops want to be brought</text>
  <text start="958.06" dur="5.55">into Syria and while all this is going</text>
  <text start="960.73" dur="4.77">on we have the assassination of Kim Jong</text>
  <text start="963.61" dur="4.2">Un&amp;#39;s brother where it&amp;#39;s being blamed on</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="3.96">North Korea and North Korea having a</text>
  <text start="967.81" dur="4.17">chemical weapons so we can see where all</text>
  <text start="969.46" dur="4.53">this is headed right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="971.98" dur="4.89">that they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda trying</text>
  <text start="973.99" dur="5.88">to reach their goal of removing Assad</text>
  <text start="976.87" dur="4.53">getting us into war listen everyone</text>
