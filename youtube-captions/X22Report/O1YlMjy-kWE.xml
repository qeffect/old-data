  <text start="127.71" dur="4.98">happening there and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="7.019">the young people are hit very very hard</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="7.109">with 57 percent unemployment between</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="3.901">ages of 15 and 24 they just do not have</text>
  <text start="139.799" dur="3.601">job</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s making it very difficult for</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="3.86">the people to survive and you have to</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="5.61">remember the youth of the country</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="6.04">support the country going forward and if</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re getting close to 60% this is</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="5.4">more than half of the young people that</text>
  <text start="155.85" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t have jobs and again this country</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="5.16">will not make it but we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="6.81">same thing happen in Cyprus in Spain in</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="7.44">Italy in France all across Europe it is</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="6.24">spreading to the UK Australia it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="5">moving all over the place and here in</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="6.42">the United States we understand that</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="5.08">unemployment is very very high now the</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="3.9">corporate media was out there today</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="5.43">trying to convince us that retail sales</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s a rebound it&amp;#39;s an it&amp;#39;s a miracle</text>
  <text start="186.81" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re really on track and things are</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="3.33">actually getting better and again we</text>
  <text start="192.27" dur="4.02">really have to look at what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="5.22">happening here and it was all over the</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="5.43">news today that retail was doing very</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="4.35">well and again they only use weather</text>
  <text start="201.72" dur="3.09">when they need it and they don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="5.4">weather when they don&amp;#39;t need it and of</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="5.76">course this is for February and I guess</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="4.44">there was no snow in February so they</text>
  <text start="210.57" dur="3.84">didn&amp;#39;t have to use it and and the</text>
  <text start="213" dur="3.18">numbers look good so they just drop</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="3.78">weather to the to the wayside here but</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="5.809">what they do is they go back and they</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="6.84">revise a lot of numbers I mean back in</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="5.411">January they told us that sales declined</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="4.35">by negative point 4 then of course in</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="3.869">February they go back to January and</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="3.75">they revised the numbers in the drop was</text>
  <text start="231.269" dur="4.951">really negative 0.6%</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="5.579">here they were expecting 0.2% and they</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="4.83">received point three percent worth of</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="3.661">sales but when you look around and you</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="3.48">see what&amp;#39;s really happening it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="4.05">make any sense and this is how we know</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="4.2">this number is definitely going to be</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.44">revised but if you really look at last</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="6.59">month it was negative 0.6 and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.86" dur="7.86">positive 0.3 really where are we at</text>
  <text start="255.32" dur="6.639">sales are not that great because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="5.99">look at real information we understand</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="7.801">that Barnes and Noble staples Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="7.6">JCPenney Sbarro all closing stores</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="4.409">McDonald&amp;#39;s reporting a decline in sales</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="6.509">for fast</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="7.65">which is very inexpensive again from</text>
  <text start="278.819" dur="6.231">that type of data we are saying that how</text>
  <text start="281.819" dur="5.491">possibly could sales be getting better</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="4.57">things are closing</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="4.469">people are getting unemployed we have a</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="5.43">huge amount of people who are being laid</text>
  <text start="291.779" dur="4.92">off so something just doesn&amp;#39;t jive but</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="3.869">if let&amp;#39;s go a little bit further here</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="6.421">we&amp;#39;re seeing that most of the sales were</text>
  <text start="298.919" dur="6.87">in Sporting Goods hobby a hobby books</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="5.269">and music and the biggest declines in</text>
  <text start="305.789" dur="5.25">the sales were in electronics appliance</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="4.21">electronic and appliance stores food and</text>
  <text start="311.039" dur="5.34">beverage stores and general merchandise</text>
  <text start="312.599" dur="5.04">stores so the main stores were having a</text>
  <text start="316.379" dur="3.241">problem and of course those people that</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="4.351">were snowed in probably downloaded a</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="4.44">book or downloaded some music to keep</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="4.889">them going Sporting Goods who knows</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="6.829">people were in there buying skis to get</text>
  <text start="326.879" dur="7.32">around they were buying snow boots or</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="7.93">shovels or you know anything that has to</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="6.33">do with the weather at this time that</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="3.75">could have been buying sleds I mean who</text>
  <text start="340.529" dur="4.2">knows it was just a very strange place</text>
  <text start="342.569" dur="4.201">to start spending money but again we</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="3.75">really have to look closer what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="4.889">on here and let&amp;#39;s look at the auto</text>
  <text start="348.479" dur="5.601">industry for in for example if we look</text>
  <text start="351.659" dur="5.07">at autos we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="4.929">automobile industry has been channel</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="5.071">stuffing dealers they have about a</text>
  <text start="359.009" dur="4.77">hundred and fourteen days worth of cars</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="5.01">on the lot and the auto industry over</text>
  <text start="363.779" dur="7.62">productions sends us inventory to sales</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="6.69">to post 2009 highs they cannot get rid</text>
  <text start="371.399" dur="4.8">of these cars they figure it if we build</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="4.889">them and we just stuff the the dealers</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="4.59">with all these autos people would just</text>
  <text start="378.389" dur="4.411">come out and buy them all out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="4.8">giving huge discounts they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="6.089">loans to subprime borrowers just to get</text>
  <text start="385.589" dur="5.88">these cars off the lot and again the</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="5.58">total inventory to sales back near X</text>
  <text start="391.469" dur="5.82">crisis highs so we can see that</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="4.98">something is definitely wrong here now</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re also reporting at the same time</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re telling us that retail sales is</text>
  <text start="401.069" dur="4.681">getting better that US business</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="5.01">inventories are up that means these</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="6.12">stores the automobile</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="6.09">dealers all have too much inventory plus</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="6.329">are saying that sales are plummeting and</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="8.22">drop to the lowest in 10 months so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.199" dur="6.03">say we have stores that have inventory</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="3.72">on their shelves that they can&amp;#39;t get rid</text>
  <text start="424.229" dur="4.311">of sales are plunging but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="7.53">telling us their retail is rebounding</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="7.81">and in recovering with stores closing</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="6.18">people getting laid off so again</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="4.86">something just isn&amp;#39;t right and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="3.75">to tell you what it is it is their</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="4.62">manipulated numbers because what they do</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="4.26">is they try to spin the numbers the best</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="4.08">they can and then they come back and</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="5.579">we&amp;#39;ll see probably for February Oh</text>
  <text start="449.91" dur="6.539">probably a negative point one print when</text>
  <text start="453.449" dur="5.22">they revise the numbers but again in the</text>
  <text start="456.449" dur="4.101">housing market we see that things in the</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="5.761">housing market are not doing well</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="6.79">mortgage applications lowest that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="6.81">seen there 60 percent down and we can</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="6.48">see all across the mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="4.14">the departments in financial</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="3.9">institutions their mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="475.38" dur="4.92">are all laying off people by the</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="5.16">thousands and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="5.549">as the first quarter of 2014 a total of</text>
  <text start="482.88" dur="6.99">150 2,000 u.s. properties in foreclosure</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="7.111">process and this is excluding bank owned</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.46">properties and have been vacated by the</text>
  <text start="492.96" dur="4.829">distressed homeowner so nobody is taking</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="4.619">care of these properties they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="497.789" dur="4.051">being left alone they vacated the</text>
  <text start="499.949" dur="3.931">property the banks not taking care of it</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="4.71">people are not coming in to take care of</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="6.539">it and these houses are just falling</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="6.239">apart and this represents around 21% of</text>
  <text start="510.419" dur="6.481">all properties in for in the foreclosure</text>
  <text start="512.789" dur="6.99">process now four of the twenty largest</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="6.569">metro areas posted annual increases in</text>
  <text start="519.779" dur="6.301">foreclosure activity now why would this</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="5.221">be well what happens is when people get</text>
  <text start="526.08" dur="4.68">laid off at their high paying jobs they</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t go out and find these same type of</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="4.44">jumps because most of the financial</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="4.59">institutions retail they&amp;#39;re all laying</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="3.84">off so where are you going to go and</text>
  <text start="537" dur="3.26">eventually what happens is we can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="3.44">for this house</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="6.59">most people just leave it or they</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="9.54">foreclose on the home New York up 77%</text>
  <text start="546.85" dur="9.4">Philadelphia up 20% Washington DC up 19%</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="6.99">and Baltimore is now up 14% but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.25" dur="5.4">take a look at what is happening and a</text>
  <text start="559.01" dur="5.88">real good indicator to see how the</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="4.62">economy is progressing is the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="5.31">Index</text>

  <text start="748.64" dur="3.99">much money and I just couldn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="749.99" dur="5.37">and just because I held a US passport</text>
  <text start="752.63" dur="5.67">that it allowed them to tax me whenever</text>

  <text start="800.57" dur="3.72">know all the countries are starting to</text>
  <text start="802.37" dur="3.74">use drones and of course they&amp;#39;re saying</text>

  <text start="811.54" dur="4.35">really for because we understand when</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="3.93">the economic collapse comes what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="815.89" dur="6.15">going to actually use these drones for</text>
  <text start="817.81" dur="7.709">is to control the population let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="822.04" dur="5.22">say they&amp;#39;re going to use them to of what</text>
  <text start="825.519" dur="3.331">they use them for surveillance they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="827.26" dur="3.569">going to use them to push people to</text>

  <text start="848.23" dur="6.12">our borders and again when things go bad</text>
  <text start="851.86" dur="4.919">and the collapse starts happening we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.35" dur="7.2">going to see these drones being used on</text>
  <text start="856.779" dur="8.161">the people of the country now Obama</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="6.45">created another executive order and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="864.94" dur="6.36">issuing orders targeting Americans who</text>
  <text start="868" dur="4.98">threatened peace largely this was</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="3.93">unreported and these are certain</text>
  <text start="872.98" dur="3.15">sections in the executive order which he</text>
  <text start="875.23" dur="3.27">signed last week</text>
  <text start="876.13" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s granting the US government the</text>
  <text start="878.5" dur="5.19">right to seize property of American</text>
  <text start="880.81" dur="6.12">citizens determined to be undermining</text>
  <text start="883.69" dur="6.75">even indirectly the democratic process</text>
  <text start="886.93" dur="5.37">or threatening the peace in Ukraine now</text>
  <text start="890.44" dur="4.41">again the executive order does not</text>
  <text start="892.3" dur="4.89">define which acts which actions</text>
  <text start="894.85" dur="5.94">constitute a threat to Ukraine democracy</text>
  <text start="897.19" dur="5.759">or peace but it does say a u.s. person</text>
  <text start="900.79" dur="3.93">is defined by the order as any United</text>
  <text start="902.949" dur="4.651">States citizen permanent rhetta&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="911.89" dur="4.889">any person in the United States but</text>
  <text start="914.29" dur="4.739">again what does this actually mean</text>
  <text start="916.779" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re just going to seize the person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.029" dur="5.281">property if they interfere with the</text>
  <text start="921.459" dur="4.801">peace process of view with Ukraine so</text>
  <text start="924.31" dur="3.209">does that mean if you talk about it and</text>
  <text start="926.26" dur="4.259">don&amp;#39;t agree with the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="927.519" dur="5.491">going to come and seize your assets it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.519" dur="4.351">very unclear what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="933.01" dur="4.889">here but again they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="934.87" dur="4.41">suppress news agencies they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="937.899" dur="3.451">suppress people</text>
  <text start="939.28" dur="6.44">and those people on the internet</text>
  <text start="941.35" dur="7.98">reporting different angles of the</text>
  <text start="945.72" dur="6.31">Ukraine crisis and we can see that there</text>
  <text start="949.33" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t want again more information</text>
  <text start="952.03" dur="4.14">coming out about what actually is</text>
  <text start="953.92" dur="5.7">occurring there now we understand in</text>
  <text start="956.17" dur="5.94">Libya we had a Libyan oil tanker I mean</text>
  <text start="959.62" dur="4.08">a North Korean oil tanker fill up with</text>
  <text start="962.11" dur="3.9">oil and we&amp;#39;ve come to find out that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.7" dur="4.8">actually not not North Korean they were</text>
  <text start="966.01" dur="4.83">flying the flag of North Korea but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="968.5" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s part of an Egyptian firm and it</text>
  <text start="970.84" dur="5.37">might even be Saudi reom belonged to the</text>
  <text start="973.78" dur="4.38">Saudi government and North Korea denied</text>
  <text start="976.21" dur="3.75">on Thursday any responsibility for an</text>
  <text start="978.16" dur="4.23">oil tanker that loaded crude from a</text>
  <text start="979.96" dur="4.74">Libyan rebel port and fled the OPEC</text>
  <text start="982.39" dur="4.2">Member States attempted to seize it</text>
  <text start="984.7" dur="4.8">saying the vessel that carried its flag</text>
  <text start="986.59" dur="4.83">was operated by an Egyptian firm it was</text>
  <text start="989.5" dur="4.02">unclear where the tanker had planned to</text>
  <text start="991.42" dur="4.68">sail Libyan officials said the ship was</text>
  <text start="993.52" dur="4.5">flagged in North Korea a flag of</text>
  <text start="996.1" dur="5.73">convenience to keep the over the</text>
  <text start="998.02" dur="7.11">ownership secret so again we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1001.83" dur="5.58">know exactly who owns this ship it is</text>
  <text start="1005.13" dur="5.64">registered with an Egyptian firm and</text>
  <text start="1007.41" dur="5.79">again the Libyan people of Libya do</text>
  <text start="1010.77" dur="4.89">control the ports they do control many</text>
  <text start="1013.2" dur="5.31">of the oil fields and they control most</text>
  <text start="1015.66" dur="4.91">of the country at this point and again</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="4.98">the Libyan government is in a hotel</text>
  <text start="1020.57" dur="4.509">because they were pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="1023.49" dur="5.49">Parliament Parliament buildings and</text>
  <text start="1025.079" dur="6.091">again if the people take the country</text>
  <text start="1028.98" dur="5.64">over fully and take control of the full</text>
  <text start="1031.17" dur="6.149">military and start selling more oil not</text>
  <text start="1034.62" dur="5.37">using the US dollar the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1037.319" dur="4.291">the US government are definitely going</text>
  <text start="1039.99" dur="3.719">to do something and they started to do</text>
  <text start="1041.61" dur="4.68">things with threatening sanctions</text>
  <text start="1043.709" dur="5.461">bringing in military officers to train</text>
  <text start="1046.29" dur="7.62">the Libyan armed forces to help combat</text>
  <text start="1049.17" dur="6.69">the people of Libya now we understand in</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="2.46">Ukraine there&amp;#39;s a lot of propaganda out</text>
  <text start="1055.86" dur="2.91">there</text>
  <text start="1056.37" dur="4.08">we understand that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1058.77" dur="3.09">here in the United States and in many</text>
  <text start="1060.45" dur="4.17">other countries are saying that Russia</text>
  <text start="1061.86" dur="5.28">is building up troops that they invaded</text>
  <text start="1064.62" dur="4.5">Crimea with 16,000 people and they were</text>
  <text start="1067.14" dur="4.32">allowed to be there because they have an</text>
  <text start="1069.12" dur="3.88">agreement with a in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1071.46" dur="3.31">to allow up to 25</text>
  <text start="1073" dur="4.26">and troops in Ukraine so Russia said</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="3.9">yesterday we will allow Ukraine to fly</text>
  <text start="1077.26" dur="4.2">over Russia the show that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1078.67" dur="4.8">building up troops and also what has</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="4.71">happened is international journalists</text>
  <text start="1083.47" dur="4.32">are refuting the claims of Russian</text>
  <text start="1086.17" dur="3.69">forces in Crimea</text>
  <text start="1087.79" dur="3.45">of course the Western media is out there</text>
  <text start="1089.86" dur="2.82">saying oh my god they&amp;#39;re all over the</text>
  <text start="1091.24" dur="4.98">place there&amp;#39;s troops everywhere there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.68" dur="6.42">built mass build-up and international</text>
  <text start="1096.22" dur="5.37">journalists man you well said you know</text>
  <text start="1099.1" dur="3.81">when I travel to Crimea I expected to</text>
  <text start="1101.59" dur="3.42">find what I saw back home</text>
  <text start="1102.91" dur="4.38">images of mighty Russian military</text>
  <text start="1105.01" dur="3.9">storming Ukraine of protests and</text>
  <text start="1107.29" dur="4.08">politicians claiming that an invasion</text>
  <text start="1108.91" dur="5.04">was taking place right in front around</text>
  <text start="1111.37" dur="5.67">in front of our eyes but I didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1113.95" dur="7.71">this at all there was nothing there and</text>
  <text start="1117.04" dur="7.32">again this is propaganda to convince</text>
  <text start="1121.66" dur="7.08">everyone that Russia is completely</text>
  <text start="1124.36" dur="6.3">taking over Ukraine at this time now of</text>
