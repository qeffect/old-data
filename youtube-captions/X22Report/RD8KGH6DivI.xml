  <text start="220.22" dur="6.3">and this is in preparation for the</text>
  <text start="222.62" dur="7.68">economic transition so AOC of course saw</text>
  <text start="226.52" dur="6.27">this and she replied to what Trump is</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="5.58">doing she said my family relied on food</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="6.3">stamps when my dad died at 48 I was a</text>

  <text start="239.09" dur="4.38">have just starved now she wrote this on</text>
  <text start="241.55" dur="4.26">Twitter and let me continue it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="4.44">shameful how the GOP works over time to</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="4.83">create freebies for the rich while</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="4.22">dissolving lifelines of those who need</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="5.55">it most</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="8.26">now what she&amp;#39;s saying is not exactly</text>

  <text start="292.26" dur="7.59">elderly or disabled people this would</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="6.72">have not affected a OC whatsoever she</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="6.03">needs to get off the headlines and start</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="5.61">reading the fine print and a lot of</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="3.48">people they just like to see the</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="5.31">headlines because the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.01">has been educating us just to read the</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="3.089">headlines actually if you read some of</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="4.89">the mainstream media articles most of</text>
  <text start="316.199" dur="4.381">its crap most of it says absolutely</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="3.439">nothing they might have one sentence</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s important the rest is</text>
  <text start="322.699" dur="7.271">jibber-jabber and they don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="6.87">anything no facts no evidence now what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="723.39" dur="7.23">people all know about it and it was done</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="4.81">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that when</text>
  <text start="730.62" dur="3.72">Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="731.7" dur="4.44">was arguing that President Trump</text>
  <text start="734.34" dur="5.13">violated the fundamental principle of</text>
  <text start="736.14" dur="7.22">the Constitution by saying that article</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="8.4">2 allowed him to do whatever I want</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="7.18">Pelosi is not really understanding what</text>
  <text start="747.87" dur="6.48">he said she&amp;#39;s trying to use this and</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="7.02">spin it to make it seem like he&amp;#39;s a king</text>
  <text start="754.35" dur="7.23">a monarch and she&amp;#39;s using these words</text>
  <text start="757.56" dur="6.63">because people hear them just like</text>
  <text start="761.58" dur="6.06">racist misogynist and things like that</text>
  <text start="764.19" dur="6.06">they hear it and they say oh yes but you</text>
  <text start="767.64" dur="4.44">really need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="770.25" dur="5.04">happening here now this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="772.08" dur="5.31">said look Article two I&amp;#39;d be allowed to</text>
  <text start="775.29" dur="3.87">fire robert muller assuming i did all</text>
  <text start="777.39" dur="4.08">the things i said i want to fire him</text>

  <text start="781.47" dur="5.04">number one very importantly but more</text>
  <text start="784.23" dur="3.32">importantly article two allows me to do</text>
  <text start="786.51" dur="2.37">whatever I want</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="3.789">article two</text>
  <text start="788.88" dur="4.829">would allow me to fire him I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="791.339" dur="4.771">going to fire him you know why because I</text>
  <text start="793.709" dur="5.011">watch Richard Nixon firing everybody and</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="5.13">that didn&amp;#39;t work out too well now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="798.72" dur="6.539">talking about Article two that allows</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="6.779">him to hire and fire and he can do that</text>
  <text start="805.259" dur="4.83">and as the duly elected president United</text>
  <text start="808.019" dur="4.56">States Trump has the authority to hire</text>
  <text start="810.089" dur="6.591">and fire anybody in his administration</text>
  <text start="812.579" dur="9.24">and he correctly cited his authority</text>
  <text start="816.68" dur="9.339">given to him by Article two but Pelosi</text>
  <text start="821.819" dur="7.111">is trying to make the case that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.019" dur="5.82">trying to be a king or a monarch and if</text>
  <text start="828.93" dur="4.86">she&amp;#39;s going on this it&amp;#39;s going to fail</text>

  <text start="1170.4" dur="6.12">period o IG received 642 complaints</text>
  <text start="1173.94" dur="4.95">involving the FBI Oh IG opened 12</text>

  <text start="1178.89" dur="6.09">allegations back to the FBI for action</text>
  <text start="1181.58" dur="7.22">in addition as of September 30 of 2019</text>

  <text start="1205.27" dur="5.79">the official misconduct and if you look</text>
  <text start="1207.67" dur="5.3">at page four you can see this now the</text>
