  <text start="74.63" dur="8.46">well they remain unresolved</text>
  <text start="78.91" dur="7.63">despite the ECB having trying to pump in</text>

  <text start="162.62" dur="6.69">Italy leave it looks like the euro right</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="7.29">now most likely is doomed we see</text>
  <text start="169.31" dur="6.51">Germany&amp;#39;s inflation jumped up to 2.2</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="7.05">percent and this surpassed the ECB&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.82" dur="6.54">target and this is the highest in 2012</text>
  <text start="179.99" dur="4.53">and it just shot straight up now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="4.47">seeing inflation hit the United States</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="6.33">Spain Germany and I&amp;#39;m gonna start seeing</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="7.05">it hit throughout Europe and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.85" dur="4.38">seeing right now is that as inflation</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="3.87">moves up it&amp;#39;s going to be harder and</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="5.61">harder for individuals to afford certain</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="7.86">items and this is going to add to the</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="8.1">problems now we talked about pensions</text>
  <text start="205.61" dur="5.04">before down in Texas and we knew that</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="2.94">other pension funds they were gonna run</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.45">into problems that were gonna run out of</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.92">money and we are definitely seeing this</text>
  <text start="214.1" dur="5.99">right now the New York Teamsters Road</text>
  <text start="216.8" dur="7.35">carriers local 707 pension fund well</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="7.24">they won the award for running out of</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="5.85">money now many individuals who are</text>
  <text start="227.33" dur="5.88">former truck drivers well they had their</text>
  <text start="230" dur="6.54">pension benefits slashed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.21" dur="8.91">quite angry and the Pension Benefit</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="8.25">Guaranty Corporation and take over the</text>
  <text start="242.12" dur="5.76">payments for the retirees of the local</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="5.49">707 now one of the individuals that</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="4.28">worked as a truck driver he said he had</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="4.59">a union job for about thirty years and</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="4.449">we had collectively bargained contracts</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="4.619">that promised us a pension</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="5.341">I paid into it with every paycheck</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="5.131">everyone told us don&amp;#39;t worry you have a</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="4.22">union job your pension is guaranteed he</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.61">said well so much for that</text>
  <text start="266.17" dur="6.28">he said it&amp;#39;s a nightmare he says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="7.11">completely devastated his lies because</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="9.87">he was getting a pension of $48,000 a</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="7.26">year and now it&amp;#39;s $24,000 a year we see</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="7.68">Central States pension fund another one</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="7.59">well this is on the verge of a complete</text>
  <text start="290" dur="3.81">disaster that could leave four hundred</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="3.63">and seven thousand retires without</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="4.26">pensions across the Midwest and south</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="4.62">and it&amp;#39;s not just the private sector</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.44">industries that are suffering municipal</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="5.6">and state plans are the next to go down</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="7.32">I mean this is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="306.04" dur="6.31">in many states those defined benefit</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="3.87">plans are seriously underfunded and at</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="3.75">the end of the day</text>
  <text start="313.7" dur="5.49">well they&amp;#39;re not gonna have enough money</text>
  <text start="316.1" dur="5.34">and we said this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="3.66">when we saw it happening in Texas when</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="3.63">we saw it happening in Detroit and we</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="5.12">could see it&amp;#39;s spreading across the</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="5.13">country it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="4.72">because what we&amp;#39;re gonna find out is</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="4.55">that these pension funds they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="6.33">the money and when the market goes down</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="6.1">it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete disaster we</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="5.46">see real personal spending while it</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="6.57">crashed most since 2009 and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="5.88">that the everyday cost of goods those</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="6.06">are moving up people are spending less</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="6.21">and real personal spending a bit plunge</text>
  <text start="353.48" dur="6.9">by 0.3% this is the biggest drop like I</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="9.71">said since 2009 that&amp;#39;s when we were in</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="5.9">the recession here we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="7">now Best Buy came out today</text>
  <text start="369.14" dur="8.01">and they said that their sales at their</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="6.21">stores fell by 0.7 percent in the fourth</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.81">quarter which is kind of strange because</text>
  <text start="379.67" dur="8.34">that is the holiday season so Best Buy</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="7.47">h/h Greg and all the other retail stores</text>
  <text start="388.01" dur="8.03">are doing absolutely terrible the truth</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="6.66">has come out retail is a disaster and</text>
  <text start="396.04" dur="3.16">what they&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="398.09" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re saying that the situation is not</text>
  <text start="399.2" dur="3.75">going to get any time better it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="400.67" dur="3.81">going to get improve as we move</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="5.01">throughout this year it&amp;#39;s actually going</text>
  <text start="404.48" dur="7.97">to get worse and now as we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="4.49">a retail apocalypse headed our way and</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="7.12">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these retail</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="6.93">chains are completely going under some</text>
  <text start="419.72" dur="7.31">do to bankruptcy or restructuring others</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="8.52">do to the footprint rationalization and</text>
  <text start="427.03" dur="10.21">we can see at this point that there are</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="11.88">about 2,500 stores last year that closed</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="10.049">down 2,500 now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="7.859">commercial space that is completely</text>
  <text start="447.289" dur="6">vacant and there are more stores that</text>
  <text start="451.369" dur="4.98">are on the chopping block they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="4.5">to be added to this number and we know</text>
  <text start="456.349" dur="2.97">that HH greg is probably gonna be</text>
  <text start="457.789" dur="4.02">closing stores Best Buy most likely is</text>
  <text start="459.319" dur="4.921">going to start closing stores and we can</text>
  <text start="461.809" dur="5.401">see at this point is that there is a</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="4.56">huge problem and this is building and</text>
  <text start="467.21" dur="5.459">building and building and sooner or</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="5.449">later there&amp;#39;s gonna be a problem that</text>
  <text start="472.669" dur="5.131">we&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to deal with</text>
  <text start="474.249" dur="5.861">just like the subprime security it</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.139">started to build build build everyone</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="3.839">pretended it didn&amp;#39;t exist everyone</text>
  <text start="481.939" dur="6.51">pretended everything that was fine until</text>
  <text start="483.949" dur="9.631">everything hit we understand now why new</text>
  <text start="488.449" dur="8.67">construction is down because US</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="7.739">construction spending tumbled by 1%</text>
  <text start="497.119" dur="7.26">month on month and this is a huge drop</text>
  <text start="501.319" dur="5.791">now the biggest driver was a collapse in</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="4.47">federal construction which tumbled 7.4</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="3.63">percent month on month with public</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="5.87">residential building crashing over 15</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="6.179">percent this is the most since 2010 so</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="4.12">what are we looking at here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="5.28">getting all these indicators right now</text>
  <text start="518.839" dur="5.25">that we are in this deep recession we</text>
  <text start="522.199" dur="3.45">can pretend it&amp;#39;s not happening we can</text>
  <text start="524.089" dur="3.571">look at the stock market saying wow look</text>
  <text start="525.649" dur="5.701">at that it&amp;#39;s surging but guess what</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="9">nothing backs up the stock market sales</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="8.789">doesn&amp;#39;t earnings doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="5.09">illusion to keep your eyes off of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.139" dur="5.221">really going on here</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="7.269">now manufacturing is far from booming</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.169">right now we see real spending is</text>
  <text start="549.019" dur="4.861">declining</text>
  <text start="549.529" dur="7.67">Curl core durable goods well they are</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="6.959">declining shipments are declining and</text>
  <text start="557.199" dur="5.921">what we see right now is that the market</text>
  <text start="560.839" dur="5.61">PMI manufacturing turned lower in</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="6.719">February to 54.2 missing expectations</text>
  <text start="566.449" dur="6.69">and Matt and chief economists are</text>
  <text start="569.839" dur="7.68">warning that manufacturing is not doing</text>
  <text start="573.139" dur="7.591">well it&amp;#39;s basically going back to where</text>
  <text start="577.519" dur="5.911">we were during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="5.52">again we&amp;#39;re seeing all these indicators</text>
  <text start="583.43" dur="5.24">letting us know we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="6.96">GDP for the first quarter of this year</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="9.04">2017 well the Atlanta Fed just cut it to</text>
  <text start="593.21" dur="6.57">1.8% JPMorgan Chase 1.5 percent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="4.34">saying Bank of America saying well we</text>
  <text start="599.78" dur="5.28">think it&amp;#39;s gonna be around 1.3 percent</text>
  <text start="602.05" dur="7.21">now they originally said it was gonna be</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="5.91">at 2.5% and I know Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="2.09">saying that GDP is gonna hit 5% this</text>
  <text start="610.97" dur="3.93">year</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="7.15">completely impossible Obama was saying</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="6.12">that for 2016 and we got a we got GP at</text>
  <text start="618.5" dur="6.75">1.6 percent for the entire year and that</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="9.6">was the manipulated number this economy</text>
  <text start="625.25" dur="8.25">is in really bad shape a lot worse then</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="5.07">Trump is even a minute and actually he</text>
  <text start="633.5" dur="5.76">admitted that a the economy is a mess</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="6.03">but it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than what we really</text>
  <text start="639.26" dur="4.26">know and we know how bad it is because</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the economic</text>
  <text start="643.52" dur="6.72">data now cous Jansen he raised three</text>
  <text start="648.41" dur="5.13">thousand one hundred and forty four</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="6.66">dollars or so to get the audit</text>
  <text start="653.54" dur="6.12">documentation from Fort Knox he wanted</text>
  <text start="656.9" dur="4.68">the report showing that there was an</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="5.72">audit of the gold in how much gold do we</text>
  <text start="661.58" dur="6.42">have in Fort Knox and the US Mint</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="6.19">finally released a report drafted from</text>
  <text start="668" dur="5.55">1993 through 2008 and this relates to</text>
  <text start="671.57" dur="2.67">the physical audits of the u.s. official</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="4.35">gold reserves</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="6.63">well the documents released and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="5.28">completely incomplete and revealed the</text>
  <text start="680.87" dur="5.67">order procedures have not been executed</text>
  <text start="683.18" dur="4.89">proficiently so they refunded him the</text>
  <text start="686.54" dur="2.49">three thousand one hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="688.07" dur="4.92">four dollars of the Freedom of</text>

  <text start="692.99" dur="6.17">audit was not complete</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="8.49">now the PDF package that was sent well</text>
  <text start="699.16" dur="7.57">included pages copied twice things were</text>
  <text start="702.89" dur="5.82">redacted and what is worrying is that</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="6.48">the reports reveal the order procedures</text>
  <text start="708.71" dur="5.58">that have not been done right combine</text>
  <text start="713.21" dur="3.299">that with the fact that</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="6.09">that the documents are incomplete and</text>
  <text start="716.509" dur="6.541">redacted the result is very suspicious</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="4.74">the US Treasury owner of the gold</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="4.289">Federal Reserve Bank of New York which</text>
  <text start="725.12" dur="4.05">is the second custodian and the office</text>
  <text start="727.339" dur="5.401">Inspector General of the US Treasury had</text>
  <text start="729.17" dur="6.539">ordered her well they are reluctant to</text>
  <text start="732.74" dur="5.13">disclose information about the audits of</text>

  <text start="749.87" dur="6">1974 and 2008 this was on page four of</text>
  <text start="752.959" dur="5.31">the documents that he received this</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="6.36">period can be divided into two chapters</text>
  <text start="758.269" dur="6.211">the first runs from 1974 until 1986 when</text>

  <text start="769.579" dur="6.57">now the second chapter covers 1993 until</text>
  <text start="773.11" dur="4.419">2008 when the residual was examined</text>
  <text start="776.149" dur="3.231">under the supervision of the office</text>
  <text start="777.529" dur="4.981">inspector general of the US Treasury</text>
  <text start="779.38" dur="7.389">this is the part that&amp;#39;s kind of missing</text>
  <text start="782.51" dur="7.019">that&amp;#39;s suspicious and they decided to</text>
  <text start="786.769" dur="5.18">refund the money because they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="789.529" dur="6.12">complete the paperwork</text>
  <text start="791.949" dur="6.401">which is very odd and very suspicious</text>
  <text start="795.649" dur="5.331">which tells you something that most</text>
  <text start="798.35" dur="7.739">likely the cold is no longer there or</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="7.599">maybe there&amp;#39;s just a lot less and this</text>
  <text start="806.089" dur="4.471">really doesn&amp;#39;t look good because most of</text>
  <text start="808.579" dur="5.19">this gold actually belongs to other</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="4.829">countries just like the Bundesbank</text>
  <text start="813.769" dur="5.041">wanted there go back from their Federal</text>
  <text start="815.389" dur="7.971">Reserve so this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="6.6">problem because once the crisis hits</text>
  <text start="823.36" dur="5.14">country is gonna ask for the gold back</text>
  <text start="825.41" dur="5.25">and they&amp;#39;re not gonna get it this is why</text>
  <text start="828.5" dur="4.199">we see countries out there asking for</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="4.409">their gold back ahead of time it seems</text>
  <text start="832.699" dur="6.661">like they know something that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="835.069" dur="8.7">happen now we understand that the debt</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="8.88">ceiling vote comes up March 15 2017 now</text>
  <text start="843.769" dur="7.32">this deal was struck by Obama</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="5.159">and House Speaker John Bainer this was</text>
  <text start="851.089" dur="4.801">done back in October of 2015</text>
  <text start="853.399" dur="5.671">and they said you know something let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.89" dur="6.48">push this out to 2017 when Obama is no</text>
  <text start="859.07" dur="7.68">longer in office and we&amp;#39;ll let the debt</text>
  <text start="862.37" dur="7.23">level reach 20 trillion very interesting</text>
  <text start="866.75" dur="5.25">right off the bat because what we can</text>
  <text start="869.6" dur="5.429">see right now is that this was set up</text>
  <text start="872" dur="4.83">for the next administration whoever it</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="3.241">was going to be it didn&amp;#39;t matter if it</text>
  <text start="876.83" dur="3.24">was going to be Clinton didn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="878.27" dur="4.35">it was going to be Trump because it was</text>
  <text start="880.07" dur="5.31">completely set up to self-destruct</text>
  <text start="882.62" dur="7.62">during the year of 2017 which we are in</text>
  <text start="885.38" dur="9.39">right now remember they planned this two</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="8.61">years ago because they knew that the</text>
  <text start="894.77" dur="6.81">whole thing was a complete scam they</text>
  <text start="898.85" dur="4.859">knew they just can&amp;#39;t continually add on</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="4.53">more debt it&amp;#39;s just not going to work</text>
  <text start="903.709" dur="5.461">because as interest rates rise we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.11" dur="7.289">gonna have a problem paying it back so</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="7.77">right now Trump well he is sitting here</text>
  <text start="913.399" dur="7.231">with this problem and we can see that</text>
  <text start="916.94" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re preparing to blame this time</text>
  <text start="920.63" dur="5.34">bomb on Trump now if Clinton was in</text>
  <text start="923.27" dur="6.3">office they had different plans the</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="7.92">plans were to make it look like Russia</text>
  <text start="929.57" dur="6.69">or North Korea or Iran they were hitting</text>
  <text start="933.89" dur="4.86">the financial institutions they were</text>
  <text start="936.26" dur="4.41">bringing down the economy they were they</text>
  <text start="938.75" dur="4.35">were gonna start a war right off the bat</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="5.82">and they were gonna make it look like it</text>
  <text start="943.1" dur="6.299">was everyone else&amp;#39;s fault but Trump is</text>
  <text start="946.49" dur="5.67">now in office so he&amp;#39;s not following the</text>
  <text start="949.399" dur="5.161">plans right now and it looks like what</text>
  <text start="952.16" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re switching</text>
  <text start="954.56" dur="4.95">everything and moving thing everything</text>
  <text start="956.209" dur="5.88">over to blame him now there the stock</text>
  <text start="959.51" dur="4.35">market is surging keeps all eyes off of</text>
  <text start="962.089" dur="5.94">everything everyone believes that the</text>
  <text start="963.86" dur="6">economy is doing well now remember Trump</text>
  <text start="968.029" dur="4.411">has done nothing to the economy yes</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="4.77">during his speech he said all these</text>
  <text start="972.44" dur="4.17">companies promised to spend money but</text>
  <text start="974.63" dur="3.56">they haven&amp;#39;t done it yet no jobs have</text>
  <text start="976.61" dur="4.26">been brought back nothing has been done</text>
  <text start="978.19" dur="3.72">so right now this is still the Obama</text>
  <text start="980.87" dur="5.49">economy</text>
  <text start="981.91" dur="7.239">as we move throughout this year it will</text>
  <text start="986.36" dur="4.65">become the Trump economy because the</text>
  <text start="989.149" dur="5.971">news the corporate media the central</text>
  <text start="991.01" dur="6.98">bank they will make it look like this is</text>
  <text start="995.12" dur="5.159">Trump&amp;#39;s economy they&amp;#39;re setting him up</text>
  <text start="997.99" dur="4.98">because they&amp;#39;re gonna blame all of this</text>
  <text start="1000.279" dur="5.221">on him when the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="3.67">especially with this debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="1005.5" dur="3.5">problem now most likely</text>
  <text start="1006.64" dur="5.85">the debt ceiling is going to be raised</text>
  <text start="1009" dur="6.97">because if they don&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re gonna be in</text>
  <text start="1012.49" dur="6.27">a huge world of problems now maybe Trump</text>
  <text start="1015.97" dur="4.71">is planning on not raising the debt</text>
  <text start="1018.76" dur="4.44">ceiling but you could see what he was</text>
  <text start="1020.68" dur="4.11">saying yesterday about borrowing a</text>
  <text start="1023.2" dur="3.83">trillion dollars for the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1024.79" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to have to raise it and</text>
  <text start="1027.03" dur="4.84">remember the US economy is holding up</text>
  <text start="1029.53" dur="5.34">the world for about 70 percent of the</text>
  <text start="1031.87" dur="5.79">u.s. economic output is generated by</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="7.37">domestic consumption if the American</text>
  <text start="1037.66" dur="8.279">consumer stops Europe Asia collapse and</text>
  <text start="1042.24" dur="6.06">this is where we are headed because the</text>
  <text start="1045.939" dur="5.311">consumer as we can see today well</text>
  <text start="1048.3" dur="3.58">spending is declining retail is</text>
  <text start="1051.25" dur="2.88">declining</text>
  <text start="1051.88" dur="3.81">that means manufacturers don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1054.13" dur="4.11">manufacture that means China is not</text>
  <text start="1055.69" dur="5.729">going to produce as much and we can see</text>
  <text start="1058.24" dur="6.9">already this is having an effect around</text>
  <text start="1061.419" dur="5.701">the world and as time goes on and as we</text>
  <text start="1065.14" dur="4.62">move throughout this year it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1067.12" dur="4.68">going to get worse it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="1069.76" dur="4.71">improve it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if he brings</text>
  <text start="1071.8" dur="4.77">back 300,000 manufacturing jumps first</text>
  <text start="1074.47" dur="4.5">of all we don&amp;#39;t have the factories right</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="5.01">now to support any of this and by the</text>
  <text start="1078.97" dur="6.6">time the corporation&amp;#39;s get around into</text>
  <text start="1081.58" dur="6">into it investing into this it it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1085.57" dur="5.64">not going to happen the collapse is</text>
  <text start="1087.58" dur="5.849">going to be here way before any of that</text>
  <text start="1091.21" dur="4.65">is done that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m thinking all of</text>
  <text start="1093.429" dur="5.791">this is being set up for after the</text>
