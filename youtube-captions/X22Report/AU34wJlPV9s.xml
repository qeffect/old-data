  <text start="86.44" dur="7.13">economy into over drive they want you to</text>

  <text start="103.78" dur="6.63">understand this this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="105.55" dur="9.75">this right now because when Trump and</text>
  <text start="110.41" dur="8.19">now we&amp;#39;re hearing that maybe he will not</text>
  <text start="115.3" dur="7.379">be sworn in maybe something will happen</text>

  <text start="129.85" dur="12.51">economy was incredible and during</text>
  <text start="134.74" dur="10.8">Trump&amp;#39;s presidency during his term the</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="6.72">economy fell apart because of what he</text>
  <text start="145.54" dur="6.18">has done now they might shift this to</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="6.45">another country another group depending</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="5.67">on how this all plays out but we see</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="5.4">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="5.7">for example a consumer confidence doll</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="3.99">over the corporate media that Americans</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="4.229">are very confident in the current</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="6.66">conditions and they haven&amp;#39;t been higher</text>
  <text start="167.319" dur="6.75">than this since July of 2005 now when we</text>
  <text start="171.58" dur="8.25">look back in time and we look at the</text>
  <text start="174.069" dur="7.651">image consumer confidence we see that it</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="7.32">reached all-time high</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="8.51">in the middle of 2007 approaching 2008</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="6.57">and you know what happened after that</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="9.539">the entire economy fell apart well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="9.9">at the same level as we were back then</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="7.231">kind of scary because it looks like</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re repeating the same exact pattern</text>
  <text start="207" dur="8.59">when we look at the stock market we were</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="10.05">at 14,000 and change in the Dow during</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="8.7">the 2008 year the highest ever people</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="9.36">were amazed it&amp;#39;s unbelievable well here</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="8.089">we are approaching 20,000 and of course</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="5.73">the corporate earnings the sales</text>
  <text start="232.379" dur="5.17">everything doesn&amp;#39;t fit we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="6.75">happening we know the Fed is creating</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="5.55">covertly currency like crazy shoving in</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="6.69">to the stock market they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="10.021">shoveling it in to boost this as high as</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="7.289">it possibly can and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="5.609">interesting is that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="255.849" dur="6.781">they released its latest progress report</text>
  <text start="258.729" dur="6.631">and it reported that the net worth of</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="5.34">households and nonprofits they&amp;#39;re lumped</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="8.34">together rose in the third quarter by</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="9.75">1.8% or 1.59 trillion to a record 90</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="7.52">trillion dollars that&amp;#39;s up 6% or 5.2</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="6.629">trillion from a year ago</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="6.12">now that 12-month increase of five point</text>
  <text start="284.349" dur="6.931">two trillion is larger than the GDP of</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="6.94">Japan they&amp;#39;re saying the total household</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="8.94">net worth is now nearly 5 times the size</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="11.93">of u.s. GDP in 2007 and that was the top</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="8.879">of the bubble during that period and</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="6.009">household net worth was sixty six point</text>
  <text start="309.099" dur="6.011">five trillion or about 4.5 times the</text>
  <text start="312.219" dur="10.241">size of GDP before it all blew up</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="10.11">and we&amp;#39;re at 90 trillion we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="5.79">top of the bubble how do you think this</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="4.53">is going to play out it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="6.03">complete disaster but the question is</text>
  <text start="329.75" dur="8.04">who has all this wealth because the Fed</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="6.42">had another report where they reported</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="5.54">that 46 percent of adults do not have</text>
  <text start="340.7" dur="4.83">enough money to cover a $400 emergency</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;d have to sell some furniture or</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="3.08">charge it on their Mac style cards to</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="5.04">get by</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="6.22">bankrate.com also found that 63% of</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="6.12">Americans don&amp;#39;t have enough savings to</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="8.19">pay for a 500 to $1,000 emergency so the</text>
  <text start="358.97" dur="6.69">question is who has all this wealth well</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="8.16">we know where it went it went to the</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="8.51">elite the top echelon because in the end</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="7.02">game they&amp;#39;re extracting all the wealth</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="7.5">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing now when we</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="6.99">look at hotel inventories we see a</text>
  <text start="381.67" dur="5.29">familiar pattern and when we look at all</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="4.98">these indicators we see a very very</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="5.37">familiar pattern right now for the third</text>
  <text start="390.17" dur="4.2">month in a row wholesale inventories</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="7.14">dropped year-over-year tumbling about</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="7.8">0.4 percent in October and when we look</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="6.57">at this and we go back in time we go</text>
  <text start="402.17" dur="5.96">back to the year 2000 well we saw the</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="6.75">same thing happen</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="6.75">fast-forward to 2007 going to 2008 we</text>
  <text start="412.79" dur="5.6">saw the same exact thing happen</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="7.56">we&amp;#39;re at that point right now once again</text>
  <text start="418.39" dur="6.34">which means we&amp;#39;re heading into a</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="3.73">depression because at this point we</text>
  <text start="424.73" dur="3.12">should already be in a recession and</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="5.54">we&amp;#39;ve looked at many different</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="6.96">indicators that are flashing red lights</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="7.6">showing us that we are already in that</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="9.12">recession slash depression and it looks</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="6.84">like the central bank&amp;#39;s well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="4.47">almost complete with all their testing</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="4.71">what do I mean by that</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="7.68">well if you remember back going back in</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="9.119">time they tested the bailouts how would</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="7.619">that work that was in 2008 how will</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="7.051">people react to this well people did it</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="5.881">they didn&amp;#39;t like it the United States</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="4.68">passed the law no bailouts other</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="5.309">governments passed laws no bailouts that</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="5.28">didn&amp;#39;t work that well then they went a</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="5.041">step further and I said alright let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="5.19">try bailing Cyprus let&amp;#39;s help let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="4.41">how people react didn&amp;#39;t go over so bad</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re able to lock their accounts</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="5.46">not many people protested rioted we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="5.22">able to swap out their currency for</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="5.88">other worthless paper we&amp;#39;re able to have</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="5.82">capital controls for over a year that</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="5.34">test went over pretty darn good then we</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="4.83">went to Greece let&amp;#39;s see if we can do</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="5.09">the same exact thing there many people</text>
  <text start="503.36" dur="9.41">took their cash out of the bank</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="10.15">prior to ballon well this is a problem</text>
  <text start="512.77" dur="7.93">so what do they do they started up the</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="9.84">story talking about banning cash Europe</text>
  <text start="520.7" dur="8.79">the 500 euro India the 500 rupee the</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="6.39">United States the $100 bill they started</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="8.16">the talks putting it out there and then</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="6.3">in India they tried it well it didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="537.65" dur="5.3">as well as they thought</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="7.47">but people brought in their currency and</text>
  <text start="542.95" dur="7.63">exchanged it for smaller bills the</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="6.829">beginning of banning cash and now in</text>
  <text start="550.58" dur="6">India they&amp;#39;re going to the next test</text>
  <text start="553.089" dur="7.931">because we know the currency well that</text>
  <text start="556.58" dur="8.34">isn&amp;#39;t the wealth of the people they want</text>
  <text start="561.02" dur="5.28">gold they want assets if you really</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="4.82">think about it this is what the central</text>
  <text start="566.3" dur="6.99">bankers do they put a country into debt</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="5.2">they give them worthless paper and then</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="3.72">once the countries so far into debt and</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s nothing else they can do the</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="4.91">creditors the bankers all of them they</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="5.36">swoop in and they purchase</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re assets for pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="4.71">and of course what are the view they use</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="5.7">worthless paper to purchase these hard</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="7.88">assets well this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="592.24" dur="8.64">to do to the people and in India well</text>
  <text start="596.94" dur="9.339">they are beginning to confiscate gold</text>
  <text start="600.88" dur="9.449">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is the government</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="7.021">is allowing the tax officials to go into</text>
  <text start="610.329" dur="6.841">people&amp;#39;s homes to go through their</text>
  <text start="613.3" dur="7.32">things looking for gold could be gold</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="6.9">jewelry it could be bars it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="620.62" dur="5.519">really matter and the government</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="4.319">clarified among other things the rules</text>
  <text start="626.139" dur="5.7">governing when tax officials could seize</text>
  <text start="628.389" dur="5.88">gold so nothing would happen if the</text>
  <text start="631.839" dur="5.641">holding is limited to 500 grams per</text>
  <text start="634.269" dur="7.171">married women 250 grams per unmarried</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="6.18">woman and 100 grams per male it also</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="5.089">said there would be no limits on jewelry</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="5.4">provided it is acquired from inheritance</text>
  <text start="646.529" dur="6.37">also the officer conducting the search</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="6.99">has discretion to not seize even higher</text>
  <text start="652.899" dur="5.641">quantity of gold jewelry what this means</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="5.58">unfortunately is that India&amp;#39;s income tax</text>
  <text start="658.54" dur="5.729">officers they&amp;#39;ve just won the lottery</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="4.699">during a raid they can on the spot</text>
  <text start="664.269" dur="6.18">decide whether or not to confiscate</text>
  <text start="666.329" dur="9.51">family&amp;#39;s gold holdings and remember the</text>
  <text start="670.449" dur="5.39">people of India they hold a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="8.23">approximately about 20,000 metric tons</text>
  <text start="679.51" dur="7.38">of inherited gold so they want to see</text>
  <text start="684.55" dur="5.159">how the people react they want to see</text>
  <text start="686.89" dur="5">what the people are going to do this</text>
  <text start="689.709" dur="4.231">happened here in the United States where</text>
  <text start="691.89" dur="3.309">it happened a little differently where</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="3.66">the United States came in and gave</text>
  <text start="695.199" dur="6.031">people worthless paper for their gold I</text>
  <text start="697.6" dur="5.219">think it was $20 an ounce and as soon as</text>
  <text start="701.23" dur="6.87">they had all the gold they upped it to</text>
  <text start="702.819" dur="9.091">35 well this time around the entire</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="5.7">system is plagued with debt they want</text>

  <text start="713.8" dur="3.3">have</text>
  <text start="715" dur="6.57">and they&amp;#39;re coming for it and you can</text>
  <text start="717.1" dur="9.12">see over time how they are testing this</text>
  <text start="721.57" dur="7.23">step by step by step very slowly very</text>
  <text start="726.22" dur="4.86">methodically to make sure people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="728.8" dur="3.54">realize what&amp;#39;s going on but when you</text>
  <text start="731.08" dur="2.7">start putting all the pieces together</text>
  <text start="732.34" dur="4.65">and you&amp;#39;re lining it up and you see</text>
  <text start="733.78" dur="7.47">what&amp;#39;s going on you see exactly what</text>
  <text start="736.99" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re doing because sooner or later</text>
  <text start="741.25" dur="6.14">all of this is going to happen in each</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="4.86">and every one of these countries and</text>
