  <text start="49.449" dur="6.421">ounces or so of silver and that was a</text>
  <text start="52.899" dur="6.351">typo on their part they corrected it and</text>
  <text start="55.87" dur="6.919">now it&amp;#39;s 2.7 million ounces or so</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="7.78">bounces of silver so it was just a typo</text>

  <text start="67.03" dur="4.89">news now the IMF came out with a report</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="6.4">saying that the it the economic recovery</text>
  <text start="71.92" dur="6.93">is fake and governments are in massive</text>
  <text start="75.79" dur="4.89">massive debt and we see this throughout</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="3.809">the world we see it in japan we see it</text>
  <text start="80.68" dur="5.04">in europe and we see it in us anywhere</text>
  <text start="82.659" dur="5.131">there is a western central bank we see</text>
  <text start="85.72" dur="6.179">that all these governments are in so</text>
  <text start="87.79" dur="6.119">much debt that they can&amp;#39;t really get out</text>
  <text start="91.899" dur="3.631">of it it&amp;#39;s impossible I mean let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="93.909" dur="3.6">let&amp;#39;s look at the facts let&amp;#39;s just look</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="6.47">at Detroit let&amp;#39;s look at Cypress let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.509" dur="7.621">look at Greece all of these places</text>
  <text start="102" dur="7.119">continually took on more and more debt</text>
  <text start="105.13" dur="7.62">and as they as you do that it becomes</text>
  <text start="109.119" dur="5.971">impossible after a certain point in time</text>
  <text start="112.75" dur="4.439">to take on more because you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="4.889">make the payments this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.189" dur="5.011">happening to the government and the</text>
  <text start="119.979" dur="4.081">United States right now we are seeing</text>
  <text start="122.2" dur="4.05">that they are in so much debt and</text>
  <text start="124.06" dur="6.33">without these interest rates being so</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="7.68">low they would be in really deep</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="6.44">and they would not be able to function</text>
  <text start="133.93" dur="5.57">at all and</text>
  <text start="136.83" dur="6.33">we are seeing things starting to fall</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="6.45">apart just like we saw in Greece and we</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="5.64">saw it in Cyprus and we see in Portugal</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="5.31">and we see in Spain and we see in France</text>
  <text start="148.8" dur="5.85">and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the u.s. right</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="6.81">now when was the last time you heard of</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="8.57">a city declaring bankruptcy especially a</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="8.19">city as big as Detroit really never and</text>
  <text start="163.22" dur="6.22">here they are today and this is a sign</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="8.27">of the times that things are not going</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="9.75">well for the central bankers for the</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="9.31">government for the entire economy it is</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="8.21">starting to fall apart and we see more</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="8.1">and more of this and for instance</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="7.27">JPMorgan okay is there gold plummets up</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="6.3">by sixty-six percent in one day just to</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="5.94">over one ton and what this goes on to</text>
  <text start="198.24" dur="4.23">say is that JPMorgan reported that just</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="4.47">under twelve thousand ounces of eligible</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.28">gold the same register goal that two</text>
  <text start="205.08" dur="5.7">days earlier so it&amp;#39;s Warren warrants</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="5.82">detached and convert to eligible were</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="6.48">withdrawn from its warehouse 100 feet</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="7.47">below but it was today&amp;#39;s move that was</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="6.6">the kicker as a whopping ninety thousand</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="5.55">ounces of eligible gold were withdrawn</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="5.52">accounting for a massive sixty-six</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="7.38">percent of the firm&amp;#39;s entire inventory</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="7.35">of non-registered gold and leaving a</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="6.42">token of forty-six thousand ounces or a</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="7.17">little over one ton of JPM pizzette in</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="7.319">possession so we are seeing that people</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="7.8">and investment firms and those who are</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="7.381">holding gold paper are preparing them</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="5.4">themselves for what is coming and what</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="6.17">is coming is the collapse and they all</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="4.16">know this I mean everyone knows this and</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="7.329">you know they are doing it you should be</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="5.82">doing it now there are 93 million</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="5.281">unemployed workers</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="5.7">g20 nations and what is happening is all</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="4.07">across the world we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="5.1">about this for a long time that these</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="5.32">countries I mean America is very</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="4.98">difficult to see it because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="4.65">changed the calculation for everything</text>
  <text start="286.17" dur="5.61">and they change the calculation for</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="5.94">unemployment GDP inflation they massage</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="7.23">the numbers so this way you can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="7.2">what&amp;#39;s really going on but the the</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="4.53">director-general of the International</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="4.68">Labour Organization is fully convinced</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="6.42">that unemployment is going to continue</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="5.87">to rise in g20 nations and let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="309.96" dur="4.92">through some of the unemployment and</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="7">again when have you heard of</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="6.45">unemployment this high the unemployment</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="4.95">rate is above twenty-five percent in</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="6.42">South Africa the unemployment rate in</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="5.97">France recently hit 15-year high the</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="5.1">unemployment rate in Italy is up to</text>
  <text start="329.85" dur="6.48">twelve point two percent which is the</text>
  <text start="332.85" dur="5.91">highest in the last 35 years the</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="5.01">unemployment rate in the eurozone as a</text>
  <text start="338.76" dur="5.67">whole is up to an all-time high of 12</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="7.77">point two percent Poland is up to 13.2</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="7.92">percent Portugal up to 17.7 Greece is up</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.95">to twenty six point nine and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="8.9">projected that they&amp;#39;re going to hit 30</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="13.02">and in Spain the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="8.53">27.2 which is worse than Greece so just</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="4.29">from looking at the actions not what the</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="6.11">government officials are saying not what</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="7.68">the Fed is saying not what the the Euro</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="5.86">directors are saying if we look at the</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="4.23">actions and really what&amp;#39;s going on past</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="2.88">that all them saying that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="4.7">fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it just go about</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="8.07">your business we can see unemployment is</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="8.37">skyrock skyrocketing all across Europe</text>
  <text start="392.7" dur="7.56">and in America the only difference is</text>
  <text start="396.35" dur="7.48">here in America all eyes on the stock</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="5.85">market reaching all-time new highs</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t look at unemployment and one way</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.35">of making it so you don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="408" dur="6.66">unemployment we change the calculation</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="6.68">and you cannot see breadlines you cannot</text>
  <text start="414.66" dur="5.46">see people out of work because we will</text>
  <text start="417.14" dur="6.22">provide for them so nobody sees this</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="6.15">while in the meantime we steal the rest</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="4.35">of the people&amp;#39;s wealth and this is</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s happening because if we really</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="4.11">look at what the real unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="5.4">is in America and if we go back to the</text>
  <text start="431.82" dur="5.31">calculations prior to 2008 we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="5.01">at twenty-three percent but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="5.93">counting all the people who dropped out</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="5.01">of the market under employed the</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="5.53">unemployment is around fourteen percent</text>
  <text start="445.29" dur="6.23">so we are right up there with all the</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="6.42">European nations the only difference is</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="6.7">we&amp;#39;re hiding it all here okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="9.36">on now Egypt to reevaluate relations</text>
  <text start="458.22" dur="13.31">with Syria the interim foreign minister</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="10.65">of Syria now is not pro the rebels and</text>
  <text start="471.53" dur="8.86">what he goes on to say is he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="8.49">reevaluate relations with Syria and he</text>
  <text start="480.39" dur="5.04">also goes on to say that he also</text>
  <text start="483.51" dur="5.25">stressed that Egypt has no intention of</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="5.58">waging a holy war against Syria and the</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="4.14">political solution the political</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="4.41">solution is the only way to get out of</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="4.53">the Syrian crisis the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="495.42" dur="4.35">says the west and its regional allies</text>

  <text start="509.34" dur="4.97">operating in Syria have committed war</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="6.99">crimes and we know this because the</text>

  <text start="518.64" dur="4.74">United States government paid</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="4.77">mercenaries most of them are not Syrian</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="4.41">and they are there for one purpose and</text>
  <text start="525.45" dur="5.94">one purpose only is to overthrow Assad</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="5.67">and implement a central bank and and the</text>

  <text start="565.57" dur="5.82">the situation the only thing that</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re worried about is the new puppet</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="5.76">government not to touch the US reserve</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="7.5">currency and the central bank if they</text>

  <text start="964.24" dur="5.55">people and for no one to see this until</text>
  <text start="967.72" dur="4.11">after they passed it is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="969.79" dur="5.58">because that just tells me that the</text>
  <text start="971.83" dur="5.7">government is not working for the people</text>
  <text start="975.37" dur="4.38">the only time they realize it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="977.53" dur="4.08">good is after they passed it and they</text>

  <text start="1000.06" dur="7.89">get rid of it okay there was an article</text>
  <text start="1004.5" dur="5.37">that came out today that the FAA warns</text>
  <text start="1007.95" dur="4.65">Colorado town that shooting down drones</text>
  <text start="1009.87" dur="5.31">could lead to prosecution people in that</text>
  <text start="1012.6" dur="5.58">area i&amp;#39;m assuming and not assuming i</text>
  <text start="1015.18" dur="5.1">know that nobody wants drones flying</text>
  <text start="1018.18" dur="5.16">over their heads spying on them taking</text>
  <text start="1020.28" dur="7.76">pictures especially when you can arm</text>
  <text start="1023.34" dur="8.34">these drones to take out people that are</text>
  <text start="1028.04" dur="5.44">combatants or domestic terrorists or if</text>
  <text start="1031.68" dur="3.51">you decided to fight back because we</text>
  <text start="1033.48" dur="6">have to remember what Eric Holder said</text>
  <text start="1035.19" dur="8.61">to Rand Paul is a enemy combatant who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1039.48" dur="9.69">firing upon the US government or a drone</text>
  <text start="1043.8" dur="7.5">can be fired upon so we have to look at</text>
  <text start="1049.17" dur="4.05">this and they&amp;#39;re right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1051.3" dur="4.53">saying you know it&amp;#39;s against the law it</text>
  <text start="1053.22" dur="8.73">can hurt people it could land on someone</text>
  <text start="1055.83" dur="8.22">but again this is against the rights of</text>
  <text start="1061.95" dur="3.99">the people if the people do not want</text>
  <text start="1064.05" dur="3.229">this there is no reason for the</text>
  <text start="1065.94" dur="3.69">surveillance</text>
  <text start="1067.279" dur="4.15">because what are they really getting out</text>
  <text start="1069.63" dur="7.049">of it what are they really surveilling</text>
  <text start="1071.429" dur="7.71">how does it help it doesn&amp;#39;t okay and</text>
  <text start="1076.679" dur="6.391">there was a new article that says state</text>
  <text start="1079.139" dur="8.4">Utilities girding their cyber defense is</text>
  <text start="1083.07" dur="6.63">not guarding girding securing so this</text>
  <text start="1087.539" dur="4.411">article goes on to say that for public</text>
  <text start="1089.7" dur="4.02">utilities and the states that regulate</text>

  <text start="1140.07" dur="3.51">happen and they&amp;#39;re just building this up</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="4.02">because we&amp;#39;ve been hearing this for a</text>
  <text start="1143.58" dur="4.14">year and a half how bad cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1145.86" dur="3.72">are how they can hit the public</text>
  <text start="1147.72" dur="4.949">infrastructure how they can bring down</text>
  <text start="1149.58" dur="4.349">the power and in my previous episodes if</text>
  <text start="1152.669" dur="3.571">you haven&amp;#39;t heard me say this that</text>
  <text start="1153.929" dur="6.151">eventually cyber attacks will be used as</text>
  <text start="1156.24" dur="5.929">the main event and we might see cyber</text>
  <text start="1160.08" dur="4.65">attacks before the main event of course</text>
  <text start="1162.169" dur="5.081">because I also said during this fall I</text>
  <text start="1164.73" dur="5.579">do believe that we are going to have the</text>
  <text start="1167.25" dur="5.519">first part of the crash and you will see</text>
  <text start="1170.309" dur="4.98">balans you might even see a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1172.769" dur="4.711">during this period you might even see</text>
  <text start="1175.289" dur="6.12">Marshall now this is all of this if they</text>
  <text start="1177.48" dur="6.179">haven&amp;#39;t done this already before this</text>
  <text start="1181.409" dur="4.89">has happened but you might see all of</text>
  <text start="1183.659" dur="3.99">this happening during this period and it</text>
  <text start="1186.299" dur="4.891">will be all in the name of the state of</text>
  <text start="1187.649" dur="7.41">safety for keeping people safe if cyber</text>
  <text start="1191.19" dur="5.939">attacks do hit during this time just on</text>
  <text start="1195.059" dur="3.87">the banks because they&amp;#39;re going to want</text>
  <text start="1197.129" dur="3.811">to have they need to cover this up</text>
  <text start="1198.929" dur="4.351">somehow they just can&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="1200.94" dur="4.83">made a mistake and the US government</text>
  <text start="1203.28" dur="4.71">made a mistake and whoops you know</text>
  <text start="1205.77" dur="3.51">everyone just lost their wealth and you</text>
  <text start="1207.99" dur="4.2">know we&amp;#39;ll try to do better next time</text>
  <text start="1209.28" dur="4.8">they will need to do something to say ho</text>
  <text start="1212.19" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;ve been cyber attacked in the banks</text>
  <text start="1214.08" dur="6.17">and look what happened the market came</text>
  <text start="1217.29" dur="5.28">crumbling down the Treasury bond market</text>
  <text start="1220.25" dur="5.98">disintegrated and this is all because of</text>
  <text start="1222.57" dur="5.64">a cyber attack from China and people at</text>
  <text start="1226.23" dur="3.81">this point might say oh my god this is</text>
  <text start="1228.21" dur="3.54">or they might say it&amp;#39;s against Iran at</text>
  <text start="1230.04" dur="5.28">this point or Syria depending on what</text>
  <text start="1231.75" dur="7.53">country they pick and they will siphon</text>
  <text start="1235.32" dur="6.66">off money to go along with this entire</text>
  <text start="1239.28" dur="5.61">part 1 of the collapse but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="1241.98" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re going to invades Iran Syria or</text>
  <text start="1244.89" dur="7.29">Iran and you know they might use this</text>
  <text start="1247.47" dur="7.29">tactic now another false flag they might</text>
  <text start="1252.18" dur="6.48">use as an event to move into war before</text>
  <text start="1254.76" dur="7.74">the crash might be some type of chemical</text>
  <text start="1258.66" dur="8.1">biological or dirty bomb in America to</text>
  <text start="1262.5" dur="6.63">bring home bring to the people look what</text>
  <text start="1266.76" dur="5.16">Syria just did and now we need to go</text>
  <text start="1269.13" dur="6.9">into Syria because they just tacked the</text>
  <text start="1271.92" dur="6.99">United States all of this is leading up</text>
  <text start="1276.03" dur="4.89">to one thing it&amp;#39;s to cover up the</text>
  <text start="1278.91" dur="4.95">collapse and not blame it on the central</text>
  <text start="1280.92" dur="6.03">bankers and the government and we can</text>
  <text start="1283.86" dur="4.56">see all of this happening by fall we can</text>
  <text start="1286.95" dur="4.2">see some of it happening even before</text>
  <text start="1288.42" dur="5.37">then because again their backs are</text>
  <text start="1291.15" dur="4.32">against the wall they can&amp;#39;t move or do</text>
  <text start="1293.79" dur="5.45">anything with Syria right now and</text>
  <text start="1295.47" dur="7.98">they&amp;#39;re trying everything and everything</text>
  <text start="1299.24" dur="5.98">but people aren&amp;#39;t responding again when</text>
  <text start="1303.45" dur="3.45">the crash comes when they&amp;#39;ve part one</text>
  <text start="1305.22" dur="5.4">crash which I do believe will come in</text>
  <text start="1306.9" dur="5.76">the fall we might see you know balance</text>
  <text start="1310.62" dur="4.2">of the bank&amp;#39;s you know too because</text>
  <text start="1312.66" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re insolvent and this crash has</text>
  <text start="1314.82" dur="4.02">really left them really with nothing in</text>
  <text start="1316.95" dur="3.63">the new law states that there are no</text>
  <text start="1318.84" dur="2.91">more bailouts so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1320.58" dur="5.22">do bay lands we have to freeze</text>
  <text start="1321.75" dur="6.06">everyone&amp;#39;s account because of what just</text>
  <text start="1325.8" dur="5.7">happened so you can&amp;#39;t take your money</text>

  <text start="1358.98" dur="6.93">of what is to come and you can see how</text>
  <text start="1362.91" dur="6.33">this could play out very easily I mean I</text>
  <text start="1365.91" dur="5.82">mean the blame can be shifted very</text>
  <text start="1369.24" dur="5.61">easily off of the government to some</text>
  <text start="1371.73" dur="6.36">other place off the central bankers to</text>
