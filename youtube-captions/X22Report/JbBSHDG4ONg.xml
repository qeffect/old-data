  <text start="99.42" dur="7.619">period and we&amp;#39;re already starting to see</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="5.731">pieces that are coming out in the</text>
  <text start="107.039" dur="5.61">mainstream media like The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="7.38">Journal letting us know that the Federal</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="5.671">Reserve is holding the economy back now</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="4.349">these are opinion pieces but I do</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="6.509">believe that this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="8.191">stages of the takedown of the central</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="8.131">bank think about how it started with the</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="6.54">spying on Trump he tweeted out I believe</text>
  <text start="132.96" dur="4.62">I was spied on everyone laughed</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="6.09">no stories were out there there was</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="7.14">absolutely nothing and then slowly but</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="7.14">sure surely stories started to leak out</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="6.78">more information came out and before you</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="5.129">knew it he was absolutely right in the</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="3.87">beginning it seemed like there was</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="3.631">nothing there because they were playing</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="4.05">Russian collusion Russian illusion then</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.46">all of a sudden as things started to</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="4.89">build over time guess what that overtook</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="4.71">Russian Kalu</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="5.72">with proof right now we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.289">beginning stages Trump started out by</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="5.049">contradicting the Fed making everyone</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="5.761">questioned the Fed and then show that</text>
  <text start="175.079" dur="4.74">listen I have control the Fed is not</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="4.62">gonna raise interest rates the feds not</text>
  <text start="179.819" dur="4.291">going to bring down the economy in 2020</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="3.51">just even though the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="4.769">was out there saying yes the economy</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="5.37">slowing in 2019 and we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="188.879" dur="5.131">a recession in 2020 he&amp;#39;s going to prove</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="5.61">the mainstream media wrong now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="6.21">starting to see that their opinion</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="6.239">pieces saying listen the economy is</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="6.329">fantastic and the Fed is dragging it</text>
  <text start="203.159" dur="5.521">down this is the beginning stages to get</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="3.36">everyone used to it you just can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="4.13">out there and tell everyone the feds bad</text>
  <text start="209.909" dur="7.321">or these people were spying without</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="6.039">building it up slowly over time and this</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="3.599">is what we see happening right now and</text>
  <text start="218.849" dur="4.381">the reason why all this is coming out is</text>
  <text start="220.829" dur="4.651">because we are actually running out of</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="5.31">time the central bank&amp;#39;s system is</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="5.58">imploding on itself now let&amp;#39;s start out</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="5.309">in the UK with the brexit and I do</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="5.7">believe the plan there of the central</text>
  <text start="233.849" dur="6.661">bank establishment is to keep the UK in</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="7.289">limbo and continually delay delay delay</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="5.369">and make sure nothing happens they</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="4.141">already voted down an amendment calling</text>
  <text start="245.879" dur="4.08">for a second referendum which is good</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="3.72">you don&amp;#39;t need a second referendum the</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="6">people already said hey this is what we</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="6.72">want we want a brexit we also see that</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="6.451">they voted against a No Deal brexit in</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="6.9">an indicative vote yesterday we have</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="5.67">more votes coming up we have the brexit</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="4.44">Committee Chairman Ben who authored the</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="3.869">amendment calls for a delay time for</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.5">Parliament defined brexit consensus and</text>
  <text start="271.949" dur="5.101">rewrite a government motion we have the</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="4.47">Labour leader Corbin his amendment calls</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="5.7">for the delayed to seek new approach to</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="6.39">brexit Labour MP Bryan and amendment</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="4.919">seeks to block May from submitting her</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="6.66">rejected deal to Parliament for another</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="7.021">vote and government motion delays brexit</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="5.4">to June 30th if deal approved before</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="5.13">March 20th or longer delay if no</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="4.62">accord so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="5.37">goes but I do believe that the EU is</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="6.42">trying to continually keep the UK in</text>
  <text start="305.19" dur="5.37">limbo so this way they don&amp;#39;t exit they</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="4.5">just stay where they are and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="7.17">have to worry here in the United States</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="6.51">we see the actual economy falling apart</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="3.39">and this is the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="3.69">remember there&amp;#39;s two separate economies</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="4.86">going on right now the economy that</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="4.83">Trump is trying to rebuild and prepare</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="3.48">us for this transition we have the old</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.22">economy which is the central bank</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="6.87">economy which is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="332.18" dur="5.8">most of these stats are for the central</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="4.35">bank economy because they create these</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="5.46">gigantic bubbles they create debt and</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s all falling apart if we look at the</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="3.54">housing market we&amp;#39;ve known for a very</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="4.44">long time that the housing market was</text>
  <text start="346.98" dur="4.5">pumped up and now we see it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="5.04">falling apart it didn&amp;#39;t help with the</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="6.12">central bank raising the rates it added</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="6.93">you know fuel to the fire and it takes a</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="6.36">very long time for the home sector to</text>
  <text start="361.26" dur="5.22">recover once you pause interest rates it</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="5.46">just doesn&amp;#39;t stop it continues on the</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="5.13">way it is it&amp;#39;s like a gigantic freight</text>
  <text start="369.42" dur="4.17">train and you&amp;#39;re trying to stop it and</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="4.32">it has to roll a little bit before it</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="3.87">actually stops so we see new home sales</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.7">they plunge by six point nine percent</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="6.9">and the year-on-year growth and new home</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="4.23">sales well they are declining rapidly</text>
  <text start="384.36" dur="3.42">looks like we&amp;#39;re in a declining phase</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="5.28">actually the prices on homes right now</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="5.67">they are down by 3.8 percent from a year</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="4.62">earlier so if you look at this</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.52">trajectory we see that home prices are</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="4.68">starting to fall and like I said this</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="3.99">whole thing has been pumped up by the</text>
  <text start="400.44" dur="5.58">central bankers they were planning to</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.92">bring all of this down now they&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="5.55">there exposed they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="6.78">now Cohen who was on Trump&amp;#39;s team for</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="4.8">trade he is slamming national trade</text>
  <text start="414.66" dur="4.41">council director Peter Navarro and</text>
  <text start="416.37" dur="4.23">Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="2.79">leading the country into unnecessary</text>
  <text start="420.6" dur="4.41">trade war</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="5.16">he said tariffs don&amp;#39;t work if anything</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.08">they hurt the economy because if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="3.16">a typical American worker you have a</text>
  <text start="429.09" dur="3.28">finite amount</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="4.829">income to spend if you have to spend</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="4.56">more on the necessity product that you</text>
  <text start="435.009" dur="6.03">need to live you have less to spend on</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="6.06">the services that you want to buy now we</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="4.5">need to go a little bit past this and</text>
  <text start="442.99" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;s amazing how these individuals never</text>
  <text start="445.539" dur="4.801">go to the source of the problem because</text>
  <text start="447.789" dur="4.831">if you go back in history and you look</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="5.06">at the dollar you see the dollar has</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="6.75">been losing value for a very long time</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="6.519">the increase in cost of all these</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="4.109">products it&amp;#39;s not because these things</text>
  <text start="461.919" dur="3.81">cost more it&amp;#39;s because the value of the</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="3.631">dollar has decreased so if he really</text>
  <text start="465.729" dur="3.601">wants to talk about people not having</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.529">enough to afford things it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="5.519">the dollar it&amp;#39;s because of the federal</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="4.831">debt note the central bank system this</text>
  <text start="474.849" dur="4.711">has nothing to do with the tariffs that</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="6.24">tariffs are being used as leverage to we</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="5.789">rework these trade deals that the global</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="5.25">is set up so if we really want to talk</text>
  <text start="485.349" dur="5.19">about people having a tough time people</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="4.799">having a difficult time affording things</text>
  <text start="490.539" dur="5.401">it always goes back to the central bank</text>
  <text start="492.759" dur="5.821">this is why minimum wage never works</text>
  <text start="495.94" dur="4.89">think about it if I go back in time and</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="4.47">I was working at a supermarket way back</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="5.79">when I was a teenager minimum wage was</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="6.48">three dollars and 35 cents I mean nobody</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="6.18">can survive in 335 today and of course</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="5.85">they had to raise it along this long</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="5.58">path here just to keep up with the</text>
  <text start="515.38" dur="6.93">devaluing of the dollar this will be a</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="6.48">never-ending cycle why don&amp;#39;t we just get</text>
  <text start="522.31" dur="4.91">rid of the problem and the problem is</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="5.7">the central bank now some good news</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="5.559">Toyota they made an unexpected</text>
  <text start="530.56" dur="4.35">announcement and they said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.779" dur="4.291">going to be investing thirteen billion</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="4.59">dollars in the country over the next</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="6.389">five years why did they do this</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="6.56">well they said listen since Trump Nagar</text>
  <text start="543.459" dur="6.031">Faline ago she ate the US MCA and</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="6.43">replaced the failed NAFTA this was a</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="6.15">good incentive to bring manufacturing</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="5.46">back into the United States and it looks</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="3.96">like states that were receiving newer</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="4.83">expanded manufacturing plants include</text>
  <text start="559.6" dur="6.87">Alabama Kentucky Missouri Tennessee</text>
  <text start="562.78" dur="6.3">West Virginia and we need to bring back</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="5.25">more manufacturing into this country</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="5.82">remember what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="7.89">the central bank&amp;#39;s weapons against</text>
  <text start="574.9" dur="8.31">themselves use all this money all the</text>

  <text start="605.61" dur="5.56">once you open their books people will</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="4.86">then say why are we paying for all this</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="5.76">debt we don&amp;#39;t have to all of this debt</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="5.25">was put on through fraud open up what</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="5.85">has happened in the government the same</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="6">thing and I believe this is the path</text>

  <text start="694.24" dur="3.57">research and they start to realize what</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="4.11">wait a minute the Fed is a private</text>

  <text start="729.279" dur="7.62">understand why it happened and there is</text>
  <text start="731.89" dur="7.92">proof and I believe that Trump is going</text>
  <text start="736.899" dur="6.151">to continually blame the Fed for</text>
  <text start="739.81" dur="6.57">everything right now he&amp;#39;s showing</text>

  <text start="757.39" dur="3.99">doing this for the good of the country</text>
  <text start="759.01" dur="4.259">this is why he continually tweets out</text>
  <text start="761.38" dur="3.03">how well the economy&amp;#39;s in because the</text>
  <text start="763.269" dur="3.241">mainstream media is not gonna do it for</text>

  <text start="777.37" dur="6.959">stable until after the 2020 elections</text>
