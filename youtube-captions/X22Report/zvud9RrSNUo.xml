  <text start="210.08" dur="2.94">really what they wanted they wanted</text>
  <text start="211.13" dur="3.99">control over the internet now this is</text>
  <text start="213.02" dur="4.32">something where they never had control</text>
  <text start="215.12" dur="3.59">over and they wanted control over think</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="5.4">about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="218.71" dur="9.4">who wanted net neutrality hmm Google</text>
  <text start="222.74" dur="8.76">Facebook Twitter who are the companies</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="4.77">that have been censoring the internet in</text>
  <text start="231.5" dur="4.34">a major way</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="6.99">oh the same people Google Facebook</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="8.1">Twitter and the rest you see a pattern</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="8.4">here and think about it Google right now</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="7.75">since you know RT has been associated</text>
  <text start="248.27" dur="7.38">and they had to apply for a foreign</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="5.07">agent we see that Google executives</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="5.339">right now they are creating their</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="9.93">algorithms to hide art T Sputnik</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="10.621">articles now why would they have to hide</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="7.8">them if this is open and free and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="5.61">just a search engine where it goes out</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="6.66">and gives you the best results that it</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="7.23">could find why are they hiding certain</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="5.76">news stories the reason why they are</text>
  <text start="284.45" dur="5.43">hiding this because they don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="6.36">to read or understand what is going on</text>
  <text start="289.88" dur="5.28">outside of the US corporate media they</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t want you to get another viewpoint</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t want you to read and make</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="4.92">decisions because the search engines</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="4.95">should only give you the best results it</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="3.9">shouldn&amp;#39;t make decisions on what you can</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="6.54">see and what you can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="6.9">once Facebook Twitter Google Yahoo and</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="3.93">the rest once they start making</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="4.08">decisions on what we&amp;#39;re going to present</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="3.81">you like you can see this but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="3.06">see that you can see this but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="2.79">see this and</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="3.27">becomes one sided that&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="5.4">censorship that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="5.67">controlling what they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="5.49">see what the message what the narrative</text>
  <text start="329.45" dur="5.52">is going to be and this is not freedom</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="5.46">of speech this is not freedom of press</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="4.8">this is control and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="3.93">been trying to do for a very long time</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="5.31">now again the fact checkers didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="4.34">the fake news thing didn&amp;#39;t work and the</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="5.81">only thing they have left right now is</text>
  <text start="346.66" dur="7.78">to start censoring now of course Google</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="5.68">the head of Google Eric Schmidt he said</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="4.35">listen we&amp;#39;re not about censorship we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.2">not going to remove these we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="5.37">gonna bury them so you never see them</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same thing and of</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="3.75">course they came out that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="4.59">strongly not in favor of censorship and</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="5.67">if that is true then you would let the</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="6">people make a decision let people read</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="5.22">both sides let people do a little</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="5.07">research let people think and say you</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="3.93">know something what the u.s. is saying</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="5.09">is not true or what Russia&amp;#39;s not saying</text>
  <text start="382.73" dur="7.56">is not true but let the people decide</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="7.29">other corporations other government</text>
  <text start="390.29" dur="5.46">voices shouldn&amp;#39;t decide for the people</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="5.29">they shouldn&amp;#39;t decide what you can and</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="5.64">cannot say that is not freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="5.28">that is not freedom of press when they</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="4.92">start deciding it&amp;#39;s controlled and</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="6.18">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re left with right now</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="7.65">is controlling what you say they tried</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="6.21">all other avenues it did not work they</text>
  <text start="413.96" dur="4.44">tried the fake get fake news Avenue they</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="3.72">tried using fact checkers they tried</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="3.6">giving you little symbols to let you</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="3.51">know that this is no good now they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="422" dur="3.69">the point where they&amp;#39;re just gonna hide</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="4.35">them and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="5.22">moving towards and this is how you know</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="4.65">that they don&amp;#39;t want you to see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="2.97">really out there and most likely if they</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t want you to see it most likely</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s the truth we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="437" dur="5.76">u.s. is out there and they&amp;#39;re bombing</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="4.53">Afghan like crazy Afghanistan and of</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="3.9">course corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="7.62">saying that the u.s. is going after the</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="6.63">Taliban poppyfields now during the time</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="3.03">that the Taliban had control of</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="4.83">Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="6.869">there were very very very few poppy</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="6.479">fields when the u.s. invaded that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.479" dur="5.81">where the poppy fields flourished and</text>
  <text start="464.599" dur="5.491">there are many pictures of the US</text>
  <text start="467.289" dur="4.69">soldiers guarding and of course this is</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="3.509">part of the Cabal they were guarding the</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="3.09">intelligence agencies they were guarding</text>
  <text start="473.599" dur="6.391">the poppy fields because they use this</text>
  <text start="475.069" dur="9.03">to manufacture opium heroin they use</text>
  <text start="479.99" dur="5.97">this for covert operations this is where</text>
  <text start="484.099" dur="5">they get their funding so what I think</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="6.15">is happening right now is that the</text>
  <text start="489.099" dur="5.5">different factions well they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="4.919">to hold on to these poppy fields the</text>
  <text start="494.599" dur="5.34">intelligence agencies and we can see</text>
  <text start="497.029" dur="4.431">that those on the other side who are</text>
  <text start="499.939" dur="3.901">trying to get rid of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="4.329">trying to get rid of what is happening</text>
  <text start="503.84" dur="6.329">with the paid mercenaries they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="505.789" dur="7.411">after these fields of poppy and shutting</text>
  <text start="510.169" dur="6">them down because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="6.449">right now is that the Cabal they are</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="7.35">losing their power everywhere you look</text>
  <text start="519.649" dur="6.241">and all the bombing in Sudan and what we</text>
  <text start="523.519" dur="4.651">see in Afghanistan I don&amp;#39;t think this is</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="4.77">part of what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all along</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.02">I think things are changing now I know a</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="3">lot of people don&amp;#39;t agree and people</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="4.019">think that the same things happening if</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="7.109">that was true the Islamic state would</text>
  <text start="536.209" dur="8.88">still be expanding in Syria they would</text>
  <text start="540.769" dur="6.18">be expanding in Iraq and Russia and</text>
  <text start="545.089" dur="5.041">Syria wouldn&amp;#39;t be asking the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="546.949" dur="4.26">leave the area and that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="3.269">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and we&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="4.5">that in a little bit we see Russia they</text>
  <text start="553.399" dur="4.351">begin they have begun deliveries of</text>
  <text start="555.709" dur="4.651">their advanced t90 battle tanks to Iraq</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="5.91">and the t90 is a third generation</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="7.65">Russian battle tank built on the</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="6.27">time-proven Soviet t-72 design it is</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="4.439">among the best-selling tanks in the</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="5.159">world it&amp;#39;s known for its firepower its</text>
  <text start="572.449" dur="4.291">enhanced protection and mobility and the</text>
  <text start="575.089" dur="4.711">Iraqi military plants reinforced the</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="4.95">fleet of the m1a1 Abrams main battle</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="3.93">tanks with the t-90s they didn&amp;#39;t go back</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="4.379">to the United States and purchase more</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="3.87">of the m1a1 they decided to go with</text>
  <text start="586.069" dur="2.88">Russia and again we can</text>
  <text start="587.6" dur="3.96">see a lot of these middle-eastern</text>
  <text start="588.949" dur="4.2">countries they are now siding with</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="4.35">Russia and buying a lot of their</text>
  <text start="593.149" dur="6.451">military assets we see the Syrian</text>
  <text start="595.91" dur="6.239">government troops control nearly 98% of</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="4.02">the country&amp;#39;s territory and the</text>
  <text start="602.149" dur="4.591">terrorists remaining pockets of</text>
  <text start="603.62" dur="5.339">resistance it is shrinking right now so</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="5.159">right now we see that the Russian</text>
  <text start="608.959" dur="5.37">general staff saying that the active</text>
  <text start="611.899" dur="6.451">phase of Syria military operation is</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="6.901">nearing the end right now so Putin and</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="4.5">Assad they are meeting and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="4.62">talking about all different things about</text>

  <text start="631.31" dur="4.649">country they will have elections the</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="4.05">people will decide and we know what is</text>
  <text start="635.959" dur="5.49">going to happen in this country because</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="6.179">Assad brought Russia in they liberated</text>
  <text start="641.449" dur="4.83">the towns the cities the villages they</text>
  <text start="644.089" dur="3.81">forced the paid mercenaries out of there</text>
  <text start="646.279" dur="4.68">where these pay mercenaries were</text>
  <text start="647.899" dur="6.42">torturing people and it was a nightmare</text>
  <text start="650.959" dur="4.44">and people fled the country millions of</text>

  <text start="658.069" dur="3.44">coming home</text>
  <text start="659.36" dur="5.7">this is where they really wanted to be</text>

  <text start="665.06" dur="4.8">out just like they did in Libya Lebanon</text>
  <text start="666.98" dur="4.5">and Iraq and many of the other countries</text>
  <text start="669.86" dur="5.37">this is why we said we had a refugee</text>

  <text start="675.23" dur="5.37">Islamic state oh it was because they had</text>
  <text start="678.019" dur="5.31">bad leaders and there were dictators no</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="5.429">it was the global inside each one of</text>
  <text start="683.329" dur="5.82">these countries that started a war where</text>
  <text start="686.029" dur="7.771">they wanted to control what currency</text>
  <text start="689.149" dur="6.901">these countries used to pay for oil and</text>
  <text start="693.8" dur="5.49">they wanted to maintain the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="6.51">system this is why we invade not we but</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="5.31">the Cabal invaded all of these countries</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="3.719">in her regime change and put in leaders</text>
  <text start="704.6" dur="3.87">where they thought they were going to be</text>
  <text start="706.279" dur="4.23">able to control these individuals and</text>
  <text start="708.47" dur="3.66">once they lost control they go back in</text>
  <text start="710.509" dur="4.471">and have regime change once again this</text>
  <text start="712.13" dur="6.809">is how they work so we see right now the</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="6.57">clock is ticking down Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="718.939" dur="4.65">they are talking they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="5.34">had a phone call and I should say Putin</text>
  <text start="723.589" dur="5.071">had a phone call with Trump already they</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="4.74">spoke on the phone for about an hour</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="5.869">today they covered topics including</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="5.67">Syria Ukraine Iran North Korea</text>
  <text start="734.529" dur="7.031">Afghanistan and I do believe at this</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="8.33">point Trump and Putin and Xi Jinping</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="7.95">they are working together and they are</text>
  <text start="745.63" dur="6.03">basically working to remove the</text>
  <text start="749.51" dur="6.78">terrorist groups in all these area</text>
  <text start="751.66" dur="6.239">removing the Cabal and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="756.29" dur="4.89">what is happening now am I saying that</text>
  <text start="757.899" dur="5.651">everything&amp;#39;s gonna be rosy and perfect</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="5.7">after this no because we still have a</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="5.43">problem it&amp;#39;s called the central bankers</text>
  <text start="766.88" dur="5.37">they are still there they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="768.98" dur="5.49">running the show the Cabal was just a</text>
  <text start="772.25" dur="3.3">certain faction inside of the United</text>
  <text start="774.47" dur="3.42">States that work with the central</text>
  <text start="775.55" dur="6.57">bankers but we still have the same</text>
  <text start="777.89" dur="8.28">problem but we can see that we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="782.12" dur="6.959">right path will it be perfect maybe</text>
  <text start="786.17" dur="5.039">maybe not we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but we</text>
  <text start="789.079" dur="4.531">can see that certain things are</text>
  <text start="791.209" dur="5.851">happening right now changes are in the</text>
  <text start="793.61" dur="5.61">wind we see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="797.06" dur="3.45">pushing and I&amp;#39;m talking about the Cabal</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re trying to get anything they</text>
  <text start="800.51" dur="4.98">possibly can off the ground to create</text>
  <text start="803.39" dur="3.66">this war because they need to cover up</text>
  <text start="805.49" dur="3.45">everything because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="3.42">everything is going to come out the</text>
  <text start="808.94" dur="5.16">central banking system is going to fail</text>
  <text start="810.47" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s going to implode and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="814.1" dur="3.75">want this to happen so right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.29" dur="4.83">out there saying that Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="817.85" dur="6.72">being cyber attacked by an advanced</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="5.73">actor and we see right now that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="824.57" dur="3.9">intelligence they&amp;#39;re saying we know who</text>
  <text start="826.85" dur="4.979">where it&amp;#39;s coming from it&amp;#39;s most likely</text>
  <text start="828.47" dur="8.09">Iran now of course they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="831.829" dur="7.471">it&amp;#39;s a ran because Saudi Arabia Israel</text>
  <text start="836.56" dur="4.719">United States the Cabal wants to get</text>
  <text start="839.3" dur="4.26">into a war with Iran or North Korea</text>
  <text start="841.279" dur="5.101">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.56" dur="5.13">pushing their event any way they</text>
  <text start="846.38" dur="5.64">possibly can now of course they have no</text>
  <text start="848.69" dur="5.79">proof of this they&amp;#39;re just using this to</text>
  <text start="852.02" dur="3.45">push their agenda we see the Lebanese</text>
  <text start="854.48" dur="3.72">army</text>
  <text start="855.47" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;ve been placed on full readiness to</text>
  <text start="858.2" dur="6.24">counter the Israeli army that they fear</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="7.17">is going to try to invade Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="864.44" dur="8.4">then move into Syria then move into Iran</text>
  <text start="869.09" dur="6.09">now is this plan going to work most</text>
  <text start="872.84" dur="3.96">likely not but they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push</text>
  <text start="875.18" dur="5.61">as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="6.36">Iran is not going to start a war it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.79" dur="4.2">not in their interest to start a war at</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="4.05">this time they&amp;#39;re making deals with</text>
  <text start="884.99" dur="4.91">Russia and China they see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="887.21" dur="5.58">happening they see the petrodollar dying</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="6.67">they&amp;#39;re moving away from it most of</text>
  <text start="892.79" dur="6.69">these countries are so right now the</text>
  <text start="896.57" dur="5.94">Cabal they are running out of time the</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="6.03">clock is definitely ticking down Syria</text>
  <text start="902.51" dur="6.45">and Russia they&amp;#39;re already talking about</text>
  <text start="905.51" dur="6.54">the next phase which does that include</text>
  <text start="908.96" dur="6.66">the Cabal the United States in Syria and</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="7.29">Iraq is also saying they want the United</text>
  <text start="915.62" dur="4.83">States out of there and we could see</text>
  <text start="919.34" dur="3.03">that most of these Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="4.02">countries they&amp;#39;re going to ask for</text>
  <text start="922.37" dur="5.1">Russia&amp;#39;s help to get rid of the paid</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="6.36">mercenaries and once this starts to</text>
  <text start="927.47" dur="4.04">happen which I see happening it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="930.83" dur="4.44">over</text>
  <text start="931.51" dur="5.89">so what does the Cabal have left the</text>
  <text start="935.27" dur="4.29">only thing they have left is some type</text>
  <text start="937.4" dur="5.04">of an event an event with North Korea an</text>
  <text start="939.56" dur="6.09">event with the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="942.44" dur="5.22">of Lebanon maybe Iran they try to get</text>
  <text start="945.65" dur="4.26">something started or to have some type</text>
  <text start="947.66" dur="4.83">of cyber attack or physical events in</text>
  <text start="949.91" dur="4.98">Europe or in the United States we know</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="4.68">during this holiday season there are</text>
  <text start="954.89" dur="5.01">travel warnings in Europe we know the</text>
  <text start="957.17" dur="5.85">FBI has been having drills in amusement</text>
  <text start="959.9" dur="5.13">parks in Kings Dominion and we can see</text>
  <text start="963.02" dur="5.51">that something is definitely being</text>
  <text start="965.03" dur="6.63">planned and they only have weeks until</text>
  <text start="968.53" dur="5.29">they lose this window and I think the</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="4.53">next event might be right around the</text>
  <text start="973.82" dur="3.69">corner to try to push us into this war</text>
  <text start="976.19" dur="3.62">because if they don&amp;#39;t push it push us</text>
  <text start="977.51" dur="4.17">into this war and the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="979.81" dur="4.18">everyone&amp;#39;s going to blame the central</text>
  <text start="981.68" dur="4.35">banks because they&amp;#39;ve been managing the</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="4.89">economy telling us how great it is and</text>
  <text start="986.03" dur="3.299">if it fails everyone&amp;#39;s going to blame</text>
  <text start="988.88" dur="2.04">them</text>
  <text start="989.329" dur="3.901">this is something they definitely don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="990.92" dur="4.289">want because it&amp;#39;s going to hit every</text>
  <text start="993.23" dur="4.049">single central bank and every single</text>
  <text start="995.209" dur="3.3">central bank is gonna say hey it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="997.279" dur="2.941">our fault but the people are gonna say</text>
  <text start="998.509" dur="3.81">yeah it is you were controlling</text>
  <text start="1000.22" dur="4.44">everything you put us all into debt the</text>
  <text start="1002.319" dur="4.591">debt was unsustainable the economies</text>
  <text start="1004.66" dur="3.539">were fake phony and false because now we</text>
  <text start="1006.91" dur="3.329">can see it because once everything</text>
  <text start="1008.199" dur="4.95">crashes all of a sudden you can see how</text>
  <text start="1010.239" dur="5.07">bad it really is and once this happens</text>
  <text start="1013.149" dur="3.78">the central banks will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="1015.309" dur="4.32">so they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen they</text>
  <text start="1016.929" dur="5.15">have a lot of power still and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1019.629" dur="5.52">gonna push some type of distraction and</text>
  <text start="1022.079" dur="4.69">this is the biggest worry at this point</text>
