  <text start="176.62" dur="4.65">public without them fighting back</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re going to fight until the very</text>
  <text start="181.27" dur="6.78">very end but as we know from cue as we</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="6.24">know from the Patriots this has been</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="5.939">planned for they know exactly what is</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="5.22">going to happen they planned for this</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="6.141">and they have contingency plans to make</text>

  <text start="205.06" dur="6">to start off with former AOC chief of</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="5.96">staff who resigned and what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="5.82">learned here is that there are many</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="6.13">investigations into AOC now going back</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="5.82">to April the Coolidge Reagan foundation</text>

  <text start="238.84" dur="5.34">chief of staff and they&amp;#39;re also looking</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.65">at the entities they created to carry</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.25">out in a lawful dark money scheme and</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="4.83">the complaint provides the most in-depth</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="4.559">analysis of a o&amp;#39;seas various campaign</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="4.71">finance violations to date now according</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="5.041">to a complaint filed with the Federal</text>
  <text start="256.39" dur="6.69">Election Committee in March two pax</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="6.9">founded by AOC stopped aid funneled over</text>

  <text start="268.66" dur="5.58">Friday as we know he suddenly resigned</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="4.08">and now we learn that federal agencies</text>

  <text start="457.21" dur="8.67">prosecuting that so when we take a</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="9.09">deeper look into all of this what do we</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="6.81">see well that the memo leaking</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="5.04">investigation may have been abandoned</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="4.71">because it&amp;#39;s insignificant compared to</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="5.37">the real reason James Comey needs to be</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="4.92">held accountable a deeper look provides</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="3.989">a clue that the memo leaking</text>
  <text start="482.32" dur="4.26">investigation may have been abandoned</text>
  <text start="484.419" dur="4.711">however because it&amp;#39;s insignificant</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="4.5">compared to the real reason Comey needs</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="4.23">to be held accountable there are</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="4.25">significant issues emerging with how the</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="4.44">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="4.75">supervised surveillance was handled and</text>
  <text start="497.8" dur="4.44">other conduct in the investigation and</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="5.19">everyone involved remains under scrutiny</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="5.7">before the Russian collusion hoax Comey</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="5.55">signed his name on sweeping surveillance</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="5.19">violations if we went ahead and we</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="4.529">pursued Comey on the memo leaking</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="4.11">offense it would be like charging Comey</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="4.62">for jaywalking after he crossed the</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="6.69">street to fire a close-range kill shot</text>
  <text start="519.969" dur="7.141">at our Constitution this is why the</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="5.49">memos weren&amp;#39;t that important they want</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="4.44">to get him on things that he actually</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="5.85">signed and there is paperwork and</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="8.4">there&amp;#39;s a trail and again the cover-up</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="7.95">is what&amp;#39;s going to get them now Judicial</text>
  <text start="539.95" dur="6.15">Watch they filed a federal lawsuit on</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="4.59">behalf of our four California voters to</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="4.05">prevent the state from implementing a</text>

  <text start="552.46" dur="4.59">tax returns in order to appear on the</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="4.43">primary ballot the lawsuit argues that</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="4.47">the law is politically motivated and</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="5.63">unconstitutional and this is the lawsuit</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="5.59">that the California governor</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="5.82">Newsom signed where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="5.91">get Trump&amp;#39;s tax returns now we know that</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="4.98">this law is aimed at Trump to keep him</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="4.05">off the 2020 primary ballot since he</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="4.65">refuses to publicly release his tax</text>

  <text start="582.44" dur="3.81">haven&amp;#39;t released their tax returns yet</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="5.31">and with this law they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="5.64">required to hand them all over now tom</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="4.17">Fitton said the following california</text>
  <text start="591.89" dur="4.88">politicians in their zeal to attack</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="4.95">trump passed the law that not all so</text>
  <text start="596.77" dur="2.94">unconstitutionally victimized as</text>
  <text start="598.49" dur="5.22">california voters</text>
  <text start="599.71" dur="6.28">it is obvious legal issue that a state</text>
  <text start="603.71" dur="5.07">can&amp;#39;t amend the US Constitution by</text>
  <text start="605.99" dur="5.58">adding qualifications in order to run</text>
  <text start="608.78" dur="5.22">for president and tom Fitton went on to</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="6.42">say the courts can&amp;#39;t stop this abuse of</text>
  <text start="614" dur="6.75">law fast enough and like I said I do</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="4.35">believe that Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="3.27">knew that this was going to happen think</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="3.6">about it you&amp;#39;re running for president</text>
  <text start="624.02" dur="4.38">and you say you know something I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="3.81">going to hand in my tax returns what do</text>
  <text start="628.4" dur="3.36">you think the other side was going to do</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="4.95">they were going to make a really big</text>
  <text start="631.76" dur="5.01">deal about this they knew that all of</text>
  <text start="634.7" dur="4.11">these states that were trying to get</text>
  <text start="636.77" dur="6.15">Trump they were going to change the laws</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="7.14">I do believe this was a strategy to push</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="6.29">these states to push these people into</text>
  <text start="645.95" dur="6.63">saying that we need to audit any</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="4.81">presidential or any Congress person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.58" dur="5.75">tax returns</text>
  <text start="654.02" dur="6.63">remember what Q said in post 3383</text>
  <text start="658.33" dur="5.35">imagine what would happen if by law</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="6.9">every US congressman woman u.s. senator</text>
  <text start="663.68" dur="6.99">president etc was by US law audited</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="5.4">every one to two years by an independent</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="4.17">agency imagine what would happen if</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="4.47">those audits extended to all family</text>
  <text start="674.84" dur="5.76">members of such elected officials so</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="6.36">think about what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="7.23">are doing right now they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="683.78" dur="7.05">these individuals into pushing some type</text>
  <text start="687.83" dur="5.4">of audit law saying this is what we want</text>
  <text start="690.83" dur="7.1">and I do believe that this is being done</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="7.52">on purpose and when all is said and done</text>
