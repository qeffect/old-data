  <text start="114.88" dur="4.439">point2 percent this is incredible the</text>
  <text start="117.16" dur="5.73">holiday season is picking up everything</text>
  <text start="119.319" dur="6.811">looks great and when you look at these</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="7.11">numbers we see that vehicle sales have</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="5.189">dropped by 0.4% in October in other</text>
  <text start="130" dur="4.31">words basically what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="6.631">now is automakers our channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="9.82">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the point</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="9.78">two percent increase in sales is one of</text>
  <text start="144.13" dur="7.77">the lowest points since the Great</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="6.66">Recession and before and this is</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="4.74">actually the fourth miss in a row month</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="7.11">on month and the wake the weakest</text>
  <text start="156.64" dur="6.179">year-on-year growth since 2009 now</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re out there saying point two</text>
  <text start="162.819" dur="3.931">percent is really great</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="6.24">fantastic but when we look at this and</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="11.76">we go back just a little bit to November</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="12.27">of 2014 we see that well the retail</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="9.57">sales we&amp;#39;re at point four percent if we</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="9.3">go back to 2013 we see that retail sales</text>
  <text start="188.08" dur="7.86">were at point five percent and if we go</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="8.73">back further and further it&amp;#39;s at point</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="9.87">nine 1.1 and so on and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="6.3">right now is that retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="2.79">well because if you really think about</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="4.17">this they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="208.6" dur="5.31">point two is good now of course they</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="5.19">exclude auto sales now because auto</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="4.74">sales have dropped so they say okay now</text>
  <text start="216.61" dur="5.22">instead of point2 we reach point five</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="4.92">percent if we exclude gasoline that</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="3.9">brings the number up even more and of</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.1">course those years where they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="6.6">us that retail sales were much higher</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="6.76">they included vehicle sales because</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="4.44">vehicle sales were much much higher and</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="4.17">if you remove them actually retail sales</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="6.02">come down but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="8.25">that we&amp;#39;re seeing a downward trend and</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="8.41">there&amp;#39;s downward trend again doesn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="6.26">their model of unemployment because</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="5.509">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="6.76">unemployment has dropped 25 percent and</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="6.311">retail sales are getting better but in</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="6.71">reality retail sales are declining we</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="7.35">discussed this in previous reports and</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="6.339">it&amp;#39;s fitting the same model right now</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="4.92">because if we go back to twenty fourteen</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="6.711">to twenty thirteen unemployment was</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="8.84">higher and we had higher retail sales</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="8.44">unemployment is lower and we have lower</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="6.94">retail sales it makes no sense so again</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.79">someone is lying and some of the</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.909">different industries that have not done</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="4.17">well or motor vehicle parts which is</text>
  <text start="296.979" dur="4.531">negative 4</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="6.84">% furniture home home furniture stores</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="6.06">negative point three we see building</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="4.38">materials garden supply dealers negative</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="4.98">point three percent gasoline stations</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="5.88">negative point eight percent and as we</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="4.92">go throughout this holiday season it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="4.65">not going to get any better and let me</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="4.77">just say last holiday season they</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="4.17">revised the retail numbers many times</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="4.11">and this is what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="4.71">this retail season is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="3.69">take the numbers revise them and try to</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="4.92">push them up as high as they possibly</text>
  <text start="330.04" dur="7.56">can because we know at this point retail</text>
  <text start="333.58" dur="7.08">is not doing well whatsoever business</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="6.35">the inventory sales have surged to cycle</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="7.29">highs this is deep in recessionary</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="7">territory and this fits to wholesale</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="6.72">inventories to sales which is also deep</text>
  <text start="350.95" dur="6">in recessionary territory and when we</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="7.11">look at this we can see that we are</text>
  <text start="356.95" dur="8.18">headed into a complete disaster now</text>
  <text start="361.78" dur="5.94">global commodities have been crashing</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.8">the last time raw materials like copper</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="5.99">oil where this cheap an economic</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="5.43">depression loom just around the corner</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="4.51">prices from everything like crew to</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="4.32">industrial metals like aluminum steel</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="4.41">copper platinum palladium have collapsed</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="4.71">even further in the last couple of days</text>
  <text start="382.63" dur="4.98">the crash in prices is hitting mining</text>
  <text start="385.39" dur="5.46">companies really hard as we reported</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="7.53">before anglo-american is going to get</text>
  <text start="390.85" dur="7.17">rid of 85,000 employees and this is the</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="6.51">fifth largest mining company in the</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="5.73">entire world overall the US has lost</text>
  <text start="401.65" dur="4.02">approximately a hundred and twenty three</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="5.22">thousand good-paying jobs from the</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="7.05">mining sector and this is since the end</text>
  <text start="408.97" dur="5.85">of 2014 and if the commodity prices stay</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="6.36">this low is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="6.09">disaster in the housing market mortgage</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="5.13">applications for new homes decreased by</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="5.54">six percent in November again in a</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="4.44">downward trend now if interest rates</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="5.2">increase and the Fed decides that get</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="3.93">ahead and do this it&amp;#39;s going to destroy</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="1.979">the</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="3.359">the state market because you have to</text>
  <text start="433.629" dur="6.57">remember the interest rates right now</text>
  <text start="435.939" dur="8.82">are very very low which allows everyday</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="6.631">Americans to afford a nicer home once</text>
  <text start="444.759" dur="3.9">interest rates move up they cannot</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="2.88">afford that same home and most of them</text>
  <text start="448.659" dur="3.271">say okay you know what at this point</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="5.609">maybe I should be out of the market and</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="8.459">this is what happened back in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="455.319" dur="6.421">into 2008 now back in 2012 president</text>
  <text start="460.389" dur="3.9">obama promised that he was going to</text>
  <text start="461.74" dur="6.479">create 1 million new manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="464.289" dur="6.991">by 2016 here we are at the end of 2015</text>
  <text start="468.219" dur="6.75">has he created 1 million manufacturing</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="6.33">jobs actually no actually we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="474.969" dur="5.91">losing manufacturing jobs I think the</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="5.91">last count was 1.4 million manufacturing</text>
  <text start="480.879" dur="6.021">jobs lost now if he said he was going to</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="7.739">create 1.5 million waiters bartenders</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="6.519">that would be true but the BLS has come</text>
  <text start="491.259" dur="4.111">out with a calculation and they are</text>
  <text start="493.419" dur="5.43">projecting and we know this number is</text>
  <text start="495.37" dur="6.359">always low because they never really</text>
  <text start="498.849" dur="3.991">project anything correct and when</text>
  <text start="501.729" dur="3.331">they&amp;#39;re projecting that things are going</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="4.289">to be really really good they project</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="4.409">that number really high and it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="507.129" dur="4.91">much lower and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="509.469" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re saying in the next 10 years</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="6.48">manufacturing is going to lose another</text>
  <text start="515.019" dur="5.58">eight hundred and fourteen thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="518.519" dur="6.721">I&amp;#39;m going to say this number is going to</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="6.871">be doubled or even more and basically</text>
  <text start="525.24" dur="4.839">this economy right now with</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="5.46">manufacturing is going nowhere the</text>
  <text start="530.079" dur="8.88">United States has lost manufacturing</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="9.269">completely a country cannot push forward</text>
  <text start="538.959" dur="7.921">without manufacturing a country that is</text>
  <text start="542.199" dur="9.151">just consumer-based will not make it it</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="7.35">will collapse now bill halter is saying</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="5.07">that this recent market crash it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="5.52">a test now i&amp;#39;m going to have bill halter</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="5.76">back on the x 22 we have them scheduled</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="4.17">and i&amp;#39;m going to be interviewing and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="3.18">going to ask them questions about what</text>
  <text start="563.92" dur="4.169">we can expect and</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s coming up so I&amp;#39;ll let you know when</text>
  <text start="568.089" dur="6.69">that is going to occur but what he has</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="7.56">said is the Fed really wants to raise</text>
  <text start="574.779" dur="7.471">interest rates well they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="5.72">they have to because what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="5.13">now is they kept interest rates at zero</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="5.25">percent and they&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="587.38" dur="6.87">credibility problem and we know this</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="6.609">remember the central banking system does</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="4.11">not want the blame for this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.649" dur="5.161">want to be looked at as saying okay you</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="6.21">caused this collapse so at this point of</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="4.649">seven years of having zero percent</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="4.68">interest rates they need to do something</text>
  <text start="606.459" dur="4.801">because they&amp;#39;re telling us unemployment</text>
  <text start="609.25" dur="5.1">is at full recovery the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="611.26" dur="8.18">really really well housings good retails</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="11.549">good so he is saying that this last</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="8.889">market crash is a test and basically</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="6.63">they he said if they raise the interest</text>
  <text start="628.329" dur="8.031">rates by point two five percent it will</text>
  <text start="632.529" dur="8.131">require the equivalent of up to 800</text>
  <text start="636.36" dur="8.71">billion of collateral to be pulled from</text>
  <text start="640.66" dur="6.989">the economy that&amp;#39;s 800 billion a huge</text>
  <text start="645.07" dur="4.62">number and enough to tank the whole</text>
  <text start="647.649" dur="10.461">system unless someone is willing to</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="11.459">replace it so they wanted the EU to</text>
  <text start="658.11" dur="5.5">replace it it was supposed to be Europe</text>
  <text start="661.149" dur="4.711">Mario Draghi tried to push the EU</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="5.099">Governing Council into further QE in</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="5.28">essence the German Hawks refused and</text>
  <text start="668.709" dur="4.38">instead want to let some air out of the</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="5.819">current bubbles Europe was supposed to</text>
  <text start="673.089" dur="6.81">carry the baton of QE they instead they</text>
  <text start="676.959" dur="4.921">dropped it so where does this leave the</text>
  <text start="679.899" dur="6.481">Fed and their quarter point raised</text>
  <text start="681.88" dur="7.649">increase well we have already seen the</text>
  <text start="686.38" dur="5.34">future if they decide to hike rates and</text>
  <text start="689.529" dur="5.221">the EU does not pick up the collateral</text>
  <text start="691.72" dur="6.119">slack we will not see the market stay</text>
  <text start="694.75" dur="4.12">open for more than a week or so because</text>
  <text start="697.839" dur="3.19">in essence</text>
  <text start="698.87" dur="4.23">the Fed will be issuing a margin call</text>
  <text start="701.029" dur="5.521">into a system already lacking for</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="7.65">liquidity on the one hand if they do not</text>
  <text start="706.55" dur="6.42">hike rates the credibility is toast if</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="4.23">they do raise rates they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="712.97" dur="4.559">smoke the entire financial markets</text>
