  <text start="64.17" dur="4.8">and the title of the episode is this</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="5.31">strange market anomaly only happened</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="4.44">twice before and it didn&amp;#39;t end well now</text>
  <text start="71.91" dur="3.24">before I get started I just want to</text>
  <text start="73.41" dur="4.35">salute all those individuals that have</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="5.579">been who are currently and have been</text>
  <text start="77.76" dur="4.86">serving in our military thank you for</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="4.561">your service and I wanted to take a</text>
  <text start="82.62" dur="4.499">moment to remember all those people who</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="4.32">died while serving in the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="6.831">armed forces let&amp;#39;s take a moment of</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="4.34">silence to honor those individuals</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="5.1">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="6.39">financial news now as we know during the</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="5.31">lens Great Recession back in 2008 many</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.33">individuals they lost their wealth they</text>
  <text start="111.9" dur="3.81">lost their homes they lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.2">they lost pretty much everything they</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="3.299">had to go bankrupt and there were</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="3.66">millions and millions of people actually</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.771">it was around six million people that</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="6.119">actually went through the bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="5.55">procedure and now the central bank is</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.101">out there and they&amp;#39;re hoping that these</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="4.02">six million that are now coming off of</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="3.04">bankruptcy where they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="3.09">it removed from their credit scores</text>
  <text start="134.55" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re hoping that they go out and they</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="5.519">start borrowing they heart they hope to</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="6.33">start improving their credit to push the</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="4.921">economy further down the line now is</text>
  <text start="145.44" dur="3.57">this really going to happen</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="3.96">I believe these individuals are very</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="4.83">cautious at this point in time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="4.5">went through a lot they lost a lot and I</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="4.2">think they&amp;#39;re going to just run out and</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="5.06">start to purchase things no I think</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s not realistic at this point</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.6">secondly these individuals aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="5.97">as much as they wore before many have</text>
  <text start="165" dur="5.19">part-time jobs many people have taking</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="4.5">what they used to have and now</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="4.29">readjusted to what they have today and I</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t think they want to go through what</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="5.94">happened before and I think there the</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.77">central bank is hoping that these</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.01">individuals take their credit and</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="5.609">improve their credit and borrow and</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="5.369">apply for credit cards to put it back</text>
  <text start="188.579" dur="3.541">into the economy and I don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="3.391">is going to happen I think this is</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.17">something that they&amp;#39;re hoping for but we</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="5.88">can see right now that the economy well</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s not improving it&amp;#39;s deteriorating</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="4.59">very very quickly JPMorgan Chase is out</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="4.08">there saying that large parts of the</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="4.38">society well they&amp;#39;re not seeing any</text>
  <text start="207" dur="4.68">growth in income and job opportunities</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="4.8">at all which is absolutely amazing</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.529">because the unemployment rate is our</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="3.75">four point four percent and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="2.881">there saying that they&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="3.36">growth in income which we know that</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="5.04">income is continually declining and</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re not seeing job opportunities so</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="4.53">what are they seeing why are they saying</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.409">this well number one they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="4.32">their zombie companies out there and</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="4.381">there&amp;#39;s massive rising student loan</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="4.05">student debt loads</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.19">which means individuals are going to</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="5.789">college they have these massive student</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="5.19">debt loads they can&amp;#39;t pay them off and</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="4.741">they can&amp;#39;t get a job where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.849">making enough money to pay off the debt</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="7.039">loads the companies they&amp;#39;re not hiring</text>
  <text start="251.159" dur="7.35">right now many of the companies are in a</text>
  <text start="254.599" dur="6.07">frozen state where they say okay at this</text>
  <text start="258.509" dur="5.521">point we&amp;#39;re laying off individuals and</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re having a hiring freeze we were not</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="5.25">hiring more individuals they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="266.789" dur="4.38">seeing that use car prices while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="3.84">starting to slide and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="4.231">rising delinquencies and subprime</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="4.2">defaults which is not helping the</text>
  <text start="275.4" dur="6.17">economy at all we&amp;#39;re also seeing</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="7.529">declining loan growth which means that</text>
  <text start="281.57" dur="4.84">banks they&amp;#39;re not loaning out now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="284.849" dur="4.35">seen this before everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="5.849">saying we&amp;#39;ve discussed before they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.199" dur="5.371">seeing lack of investment no small</text>
  <text start="292.259" dur="5.88">business creation and no earnings growth</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="7.17">at all they admit that large parts of</text>
  <text start="298.139" dur="6.661">the society well there&amp;#39;s big trouble</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="6.12">here they&amp;#39;re having problems and if this</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t change going down the line it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.95">going to get worse which we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="5.04">going to get worse it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="4.74">improve at this point we are heading</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="5.55">down a path where things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="6.39">accelerating to the downside which means</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="5.429">that the whole thing is going to fall</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="5.37">apart now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="6.571">that we&amp;#39;ve had many banks Goldman we had</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="5.99">JPMorgan Chase Bank of America and now</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="7.31">Citibank they&amp;#39;re out there and they are</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="7.27">reporting the same exact warnings</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.92">vulnerabilities from elevated asset</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="5.52">positions and Citibank right now has</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="5.189">joined the latest warnings from all the</text>
  <text start="348.09" dur="5.91">other banks stating that we have a major</text>
  <text start="350.909" dur="7.591">problem here and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="354" dur="6.9">that with our credit colleagues worried</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="4.02">about the ECB taper at rich valuations</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="4.379">that equity strategist focused on</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.28">earnings such as divergence may very</text>
  <text start="365.279" dur="3.7">well happen but historically is somewhat</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="3.76">of an anomaly</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="6">how much of an anomaly they said well</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="6.18">the only recent times we&amp;#39;ve seen such a</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="7.111">direction of travel is late cycle in</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="7.2">1999 and 2006 in both episodes credit</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="6.21">essentially signal that the final equity</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="5.64">blowout was occurring and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="4.44">saying right now is that this is exactly</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="4.19">what we&amp;#39;re saying in in a simpler way of</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="5.489">saying that at the end of the day any</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="7.63">King gene system such as the one we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.229" dur="5.701">in is contingent on debt debt creation</text>
  <text start="402.4" dur="3.81">means the system grows and debt</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="5.39">destruction means economic contraction</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="6.06">recession deflation general turmoil and</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="4.99">according to their analysis this is</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="3.99">coming from all these different analysis</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="4.859">from analysts from all these different</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="7.529">banks they&amp;#39;re saying that we are this</text>
  <text start="419.169" dur="7.981">close from the debt destruction phase so</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and we know what</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="5.22">happens we saw it in 2006 we saw it in</text>
  <text start="429.849" dur="4.951">1999 and we know what happened in 2001</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="5.25">and we know what happened in 2008 here</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="4.95">we are today and they&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.829">this for quite awhile it just didn&amp;#39;t pop</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="5.18">up but now they&amp;#39;re just admitting to it</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="5.94">and this warning goes back months and</text>
  <text start="444.93" dur="6.7">it&amp;#39;s not improving it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="5.071">and things are rapidly deteriorating how</text>
  <text start="451.63" dur="5.7">do we know things are deteriorating well</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="5.37">an Australian asset manager from Altair</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="4.619">asset management may be extraordinary</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="5.82">decision to liquidate its Australian</text>
  <text start="461.949" dur="5.571">share funds and return hundreds of</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="6.63">millions of dollars to its clients</text>
  <text start="467.52" dur="6.49">signing an impending property market</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="7.379">calamity and the overvalued and</text>
  <text start="474.01" dur="6.689">dangerous time in this cycle now this is</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="2.851">coming from Philip Parker who serves as</text>
  <text start="480.699" dur="2.571">all tears</text>
  <text start="481.51" dur="3.839">chairman and chief investment officer</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="4.84">giving up management and performance</text>
  <text start="485.349" dur="6.361">fees and handing back cash from</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="6.299">investment managed by us is a seminal</text>
  <text start="491.71" dur="5.519">decision however preserving clients</text>
  <text start="494.409" dur="5.13">assets is what all fund managers should</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="5.191">put before their own interest</text>
  <text start="499.539" dur="5.941">he also said he wanted to</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="5.25">make this clear this is not a winding up</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="4.71">of Altair but a decision to hand back</text>
  <text start="507.67" dur="5.37">clients monies out of equities which I</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.46">deemed to be far too risky at this point</text>
  <text start="513.04" dur="4.65">we think that there is too much risk in</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="5.22">the market at the moment we think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="5.49">crazy now we are asking is there any</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="5.96">more juice in these companies valuations</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="6.63">and the answer is absolutely not</text>
  <text start="526.83" dur="5.23">let me tell you I&amp;#39;ve never been more</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="5.61">certain of anything in my life Parker</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="5.97">said I am absolutely certain we are in a</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="6.24">bubble in this property market mortgage</text>
  <text start="538.03" dur="6.06">fraud is endemic it&amp;#39;s systemic it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="541.66" dur="5.73">terrible what&amp;#39;s going on when you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
