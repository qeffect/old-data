  <text start="1432.45" dur="6.39">coming down the pike now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1434.79" dur="7.86">interesting is that Trump it seems like</text>
  <text start="1438.84" dur="7.95">he&amp;#39;s pushing the question he wants the</text>
  <text start="1442.65" dur="9.409">mainstream media to ask a very important</text>
  <text start="1446.79" dur="8.33">question who is Q now Q has told us this</text>
  <text start="1452.059" dur="6.311">that there will come a point in time</text>
  <text start="1455.12" dur="6.63">where the president will continually</text>
  <text start="1458.37" dur="6.33">push this out into the public domain and</text>
  <text start="1461.75" dur="6.25">he&amp;#39;ll be sitting there waiting for a</text>
  <text start="1464.7" dur="6.33">reporter to come up and say</text>
  <text start="1468" dur="5.49">is cute do you know who queue is but as</text>
  <text start="1471.03" dur="4.71">we know the reporters have been</text>
  <text start="1473.49" dur="4.74">instructed not to ask this question and</text>
  <text start="1475.74" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s kind of strange that after all of</text>
  <text start="1478.23" dur="4.74">this bringing down a Tran calling queue</text>
  <text start="1480.75" dur="4.59">a conspiracy and everything else they</text>
  <text start="1482.97" dur="9.12">haven&amp;#39;t asked the question at all I mean</text>
  <text start="1485.34" dur="9.69">Trump had queue appear in a campaign</text>
  <text start="1492.09" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s running now the video was taking</text>
  <text start="1495.03" dur="3.63">down but there is a screenshot and it</text>
  <text start="1497.4" dur="2.76">says women for Trump and in the</text>

  <text start="1508.65" dur="6.81">know Q is Q part of the government not</text>
  <text start="1512.22" dur="6.18">one person not one reporter I should say</text>
  <text start="1515.46" dur="6.48">has asked Trump because they know if</text>
  <text start="1518.4" dur="7.01">they ask that one question guess what</text>
  <text start="1521.94" dur="7.26">the mainstream media is destroyed</text>
  <text start="1525.41" dur="7.27">because all the information would be</text>
  <text start="1529.2" dur="6.18">coming from an individual a group of</text>
  <text start="1532.68" dur="6.6">people that are connected to Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1535.38" dur="9.21">no longer a conspiracy and they know</text>

  <text start="1555.72" dur="5.79">everyone understands who is out there</text>
  <text start="1558.99" dur="5.19">that believes in Q that everything is</text>
  <text start="1561.51" dur="7.35">okay that we&amp;#39;re still in control and</text>
