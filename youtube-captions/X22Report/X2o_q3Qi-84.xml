  <text start="78.44" dur="5.069">entire retail industry and what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="3.87">been watching and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="83.509" dur="4.591">is that the retail industry the</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="6.54">restaurant industry has been contracting</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="5.58">not expanding during a recovery during a</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="3.54">period of time where the economy is</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="4.29">really doing well and everyone has a job</text>
  <text start="95.78" dur="4.56">normally people go out and they spend</text>
  <text start="97.97" dur="5.37">their money they go out to eat they</text>
  <text start="100.34" dur="4.41">purchase goods and we see everything</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="3.69">expand but we&amp;#39;re seeing everything</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="4.92">contract I mean look at Subway they are</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="4.56">closing a lot of their stores now of</text>

  <text start="111.59" dur="3.779">online and you&amp;#39;re gonna what wait two</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="4.14">three days before the sandwiches arrive</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="5.941">that doesn&amp;#39;t make a sense doesn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="5.49">into the entire agenda of the corporate</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="4.77">media the same thing with Starbucks I</text>
  <text start="123.44" dur="5.849">mean they&amp;#39;re closing a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="126.08" dur="5.73">stores and it looks like the expansion</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="5.551">phase of Starbucks has come to an end</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="4.679">their stores are underperforming they</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="4.56">slashed their third quarter of global</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="5.521">store sales guidance and they are</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="4.98">closing 150 stores and again these sales</text>
  <text start="142.01" dur="4.71">are not moving from the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="4.109">to online because no one&amp;#39;s gonna wait</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="4.83">two to three days to get their cup of</text>
  <text start="148.489" dur="5.521">coffee so we see right now that it is</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="5.159">hitting other areas and this is going to</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="4.559">continue as the economy breaks down even</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="3.931">though the unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="3.661">below four percent and are saying that</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="3.69">everyone has a job and we&amp;#39;re full</text>
  <text start="162.23" dur="3.39">employment again you have to remember</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="2.909">how they figure all this out the</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="4.68">calculations that they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="167.239" dur="5.821">since the 2008 great financial crisis</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve created these statistics to</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="4.62">manipulate what was going on to convince</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="4.08">us that the economy was doing well but</text>
  <text start="177.68" dur="2.85">when we look at what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="2.009">we can see that things are actually</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="3.379">falling apart</text>
  <text start="181.489" dur="5.811">we started reporting on housing and</text>
  <text start="183.909" dur="6.731">every single summer since I think around</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="4.99">2013-2014 housing has been declining</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="3.6">because what they did in the beginning</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="4.26">they pumped it up they created these</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="3.93">bubbles they made the prices move up and</text>
  <text start="196.55" dur="3.03">they hoped that people would say hey</text>
  <text start="198.17" dur="1.83">look the housing markets doing a lot</text>
  <text start="199.58" dur="2.52">better</text>
  <text start="200" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s go purchase some homes now this</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="4.47">did work for a little while but not</text>
  <text start="204.32" dur="3.42">everyone was involved in this there was</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="3.66">a lot of hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="207.74" dur="4.68">companies and banks that were involved</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="3.63">pushing this bubble up a lot of hedge</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="4.17">funds investment companies purchased</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="4.71">thousands upon thousands of homes kept</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.56">them didn&amp;#39;t put him back on the market</text>
  <text start="218.57" dur="5.49">and this was to push the prices of homes</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="6.36">up but what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing since 2014</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="5.13">going into 2015 2016 2017 is every</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="5.31">summer then this is the strongest period</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="8.49">of time during the economy for housing</text>
  <text start="232.82" dur="6.81">we see housing declining and each time</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.32">it looks like it&amp;#39;s getting worse and</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="4.74">worse now we talked about permits</text>
  <text start="242" dur="6.57">yesterday and today we look at the</text>
  <text start="244.37" dur="8.4">existing home sales they slipped by 0.4</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="7.65">percent month on ma on month and they</text>
  <text start="252.77" dur="6.779">were revised lower in April now they</text>
  <text start="256.22" dur="6.78">were expecting a 1.1 percent rebound it</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="6.301">didn&amp;#39;t happen why well think about</text>
  <text start="263" dur="6.18">what&amp;#39;s going on here the everyday person</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="5.34">who is coming out of school or who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="3.72">been out of school for a while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.19" dur="3.33">not making the income wages aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="5.22">moving the way they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="5.34">moving up and many people are being laid</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="6.06">off and people are taking part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="6.51">this is still going on and what else do</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="4.83">we have well we have the bubbles being</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="4.74">pushed up and interest rates are rising</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="5.04">right now I mean this is a recipe for</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="5.79">disaster isn&amp;#39;t this what happened prior</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="5.31">to 2008 the housing bubble was</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="5.4">continually being pushed up the Fed</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="4.8">started to raise rates and it knocked a</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="3.54">lot of people out of the market and</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.08">those people with arms they just were</text>
  <text start="305.84" dur="3.84">rate mortgages well they couldn&amp;#39;t lock</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="3.84">in and they just had to walk away from</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="3.989">their homes we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="5.73">happen again</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="6.06">and we can see as prices move up because</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re forcing the bubble up in all</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="4.74">these different cities</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="5.52">and as they raise rates guess what</text>
  <text start="324.469" dur="4.92">those people who were just borderline</text>
  <text start="326.689" dur="5.07">before were thinking even thinking about</text>
  <text start="329.389" dur="3.171">buying the house it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="331.759" dur="8.13">happen</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="10.75">now we see that the tariffs the push to</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="5.731">destroy the globalist system remember</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="6.629">this is what this push is for it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="7.199">a push to basically destroy the</text>
  <text start="349.939" dur="5.88">globalist trade system remember the</text>
  <text start="352.819" dur="7.861">central banks have had many many years</text>
  <text start="355.819" dur="8.641">to create and basically mold what they</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="5.759">wanted and what they wanted was a one</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="3.209">world economy where they controlled</text>
  <text start="366.439" dur="3.391">everything and they didn&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="3.78">about countries not using the private</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="3.299">western central money because everyone</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="3.27">would use it and this is why they were</text>
  <text start="373.129" dur="3.181">going into countries having regime</text>
  <text start="374.719" dur="3.63">change and as soon as they did this</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="5.46">guess what the purpose is remain moved</text>
  <text start="378.349" dur="5.34">in and they took over and basically what</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.35">they were doing is they were trying to</text>
  <text start="383.689" dur="6.03">blend the entire world together</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="6.359">so no country was above another country</text>
  <text start="389.719" dur="5.22">everyone was equal and if you have</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="5.43">everyone equal then you can move workers</text>
  <text start="394.939" dur="4.23">from one country to another and the pay</text>
  <text start="397.909" dur="3.69">would be the same they&amp;#39;d be able to</text>
  <text start="399.169" dur="4.8">control pretty much everything and again</text>
  <text start="401.599" dur="4.201">to do this those country that those</text>
  <text start="403.969" dur="3.211">countries that were way way above like</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="4.739">the United States they&amp;#39;d have to bring</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="5.34">it down to the other level and this is</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="4.62">what they were planning and what Trump</text>
  <text start="412.52" dur="6.69">is doing right now with the Patriots he</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="6.391">is pushing tariffs on China EU and we</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="5.85">see the EU right now is imposing tariffs</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="5.639">on the US now this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="6.389">plan it&amp;#39;s part of the plan to break up</text>
  <text start="427.189" dur="6.45">the global trade system and remember</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="4.321">there&amp;#39;s a lot of pieces to this I mean</text>
  <text start="433.639" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s NAFTA there was the TPP which</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="5.79">was completely struck down and of course</text>
  <text start="438.589" dur="4.17">those globalists like minutia and all</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="2.759">the rest were saying oh it looks like</text>
  <text start="442.759" dur="3.981">Trump is looking at the TPP he might</text>
  <text start="444.319" dur="7.171">sign it and might join up with it never</text>
  <text start="446.74" dur="8.14">happened and we see at this time that</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="6.48">this entire global trade</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="6.6">eating system it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being destroyed</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="5.1">right now and at the same time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="3.69">gonna go after the dollar because it is</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="4.98">a central bank dollar they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="5.52">after the central banks all of this is a</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="7.02">part this is all about breaking up the</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="7.62">central banking system breaking up the</text>
  <text start="475.07" dur="6.48">globalist system and that&amp;#39;s what we see</text>
  <text start="478.31" dur="4.62">playing out right now and if we look</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="2.46">back in time into the 70s and we</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="4.02">mentioned this many many times before</text>
  <text start="484.01" dur="7.2">the central bankers back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="486.95" dur="8.82">their mission was to break apart the</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="8.22">gold standard and bring us into a cent a</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="7.17">full central banking system where they</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="6.93">had the power to create currency at will</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="5.85">with no one saying a word and letting</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="5.01">the government&amp;#39;s borrow as much as they</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="4.35">possibly can without checks or balances</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="5.66">or anything like that</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="8.029">all that was thrown out so back then</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="9.22">they were destroying the gold standard</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="8.021">the system that was used to control the</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="5.96">central bankers that was destroyed back</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="5.61">then the opposite is happening right now</text>
  <text start="532.21" dur="5.35">Trump and the Patriots are destroying</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="5.91">the central banking system the globalist</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="6.87">system by destroying trade by destroying</text>
  <text start="540.71" dur="6.27">the currency by destroying the central</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="5.67">bank all of this is going to happen now</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="8.21">we see China they have cut u.s.</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="7.35">investments by 92 percent in the u.s. so</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="4.84">basically what has been happening over</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="5.49">the many years China has been investing</text>
  <text start="560.03" dur="4.92">in the US and now they&amp;#39;re pulling back</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="4.95">and what does this mean for the US well</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of things change</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="7.38">because we&amp;#39;re not receiving those funds</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="8.48">into the US but on top of all this we</text>
  <text start="575.27" dur="5.79">see the Fed Fed Powell he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="5.08">basically telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="5.7">everything is fine he says the US</text>
  <text start="583.85" dur="4.74">economy is not on the verge of repeating</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="5.49">the outbreak of inflation last seen</text>
  <text start="588.59" dur="7.05">in the 70s despite the obvious parallel</text>
  <text start="592.25" dur="5.46">of tight labor markets and everything</text>
  <text start="595.64" dur="3.72">else looking pretty much the same except</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re on the opposite end of their</text>
  <text start="599.36" dur="9.03">system now back in 2008 didn&amp;#39;t we have</text>
  <text start="603.71" dur="6.3">Ben Bernanke telling us that the US</text>
  <text start="608.39" dur="3">isn&amp;#39;t forecasting a recession that</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="4.41">everything&amp;#39;s gonna be fine everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.39" dur="6.63">contained it sounds like Powell&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="614.42" dur="5.88">the same exact thing and basically what</text>
  <text start="618.02" dur="5.61">he&amp;#39;s doing right now is he&amp;#39;s shaping the</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="5.73">narrative for this economic collapse he</text>
  <text start="623.63" dur="4.95">says the labor market is now as strong</text>
  <text start="626.03" dur="4.8">as it&amp;#39;s been in 50 years the US</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="5.46">unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent</text>
  <text start="630.83" dur="6.72">and forecasts say it may break levels</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="6.78">not seen since the 60s and he went on to</text>
  <text start="637.55" dur="6.93">say that unemployment was below 4% from</text>
  <text start="640.82" dur="5.88">February 1966 through 1970 during the</text>
  <text start="644.48" dur="3.75">time inflation as measured by the price</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="6.09">index for personal consumption</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="7.59">expenditures increased from 2% in 1965</text>
  <text start="652.79" dur="6">more on the gold standard to 5% in the</text>
  <text start="655.82" dur="4.5">70s and even higher why because we came</text>
  <text start="658.79" dur="2.97">off the gold standard they were creating</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="3.45">a lot of currency it took a lot more</text>
  <text start="661.76" dur="5.94">currency to buy the same item we saw</text>
  <text start="663.77" dur="6.69">inflation but not every Fed official</text>
  <text start="667.7" dur="5.12">agrees with Powell we see former</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="5.13">Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker</text>
  <text start="672.82" dur="5.49">says that he&amp;#39;s seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="5.49">similarities and basically there are</text>
  <text start="678.31" dur="6.79">parallels between this economic</text>
  <text start="681.08" dur="5.34">expansion and the mid-1960s and they</text>
  <text start="685.1" dur="4.38">pretty much look very very closely</text>
  <text start="686.42" dur="6.03">related now Powell followed up with this</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="5.97">and says there are no signs that the</text>
  <text start="692.45" dur="5.4">public has begun to question the feds</text>
  <text start="695.45" dur="5.34">commitment to low inflation or that</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="6.27">inflation expectations have come under</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="5.31">upward pressure the Fed right now is</text>
  <text start="704.12" dur="3.27">basically trying to control the</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="3.27">narrative saying that the economy is</text>
  <text start="707.39" dur="5.07">doing well the inflation is under</text>
  <text start="709.37" dur="4.83">control everything is great and the</text>
  <text start="712.46" dur="2.13">economy is going to be doing better than</text>
  <text start="714.2" dur="2.88">ever</text>
  <text start="714.59" dur="4.41">and of course why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="3.87">right now because they understand the</text>
  <text start="719" dur="3.16">system&amp;#39;s completely breaking down they</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="3.189">realize that</text>
  <text start="722.16" dur="4.289">now is the time to start shaping the</text>
  <text start="724.139" dur="4.591">narrative because what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="726.449" dur="4.861">do as they keep raising rates is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.73" dur="5.87">gonna force this system to basically</text>
  <text start="731.31" dur="5.85">break apart and fall apart and collapse</text>
  <text start="734.6" dur="4.81">now we talked about the narrative and</text>
  <text start="737.16" dur="4.679">now on the other hand we have Trump and</text>
  <text start="739.41" dur="4.26">the Patriots and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="741.839" dur="3.99">control try to control the narrative so</text>
  <text start="743.67" dur="4.349">we have both sides now going to be</text>
  <text start="745.829" dur="4.95">fighting for this and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="748.019" dur="4.711">going to see play out moving forward</text>
  <text start="750.779" dur="3.92">right now where they&amp;#39;re both going to</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="5.089">try to control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="754.699" dur="5.981">basically control what is happening and</text>
  <text start="757.819" dur="5.08">eventually when the system breaks down</text>
  <text start="760.68" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pointing the finger now</text>
  <text start="762.899" dur="3.99">whoever controls a narrative whoever</text>
  <text start="764.879" dur="3.81">controls what is going on here</text>
  <text start="766.889" dur="4.44">they will become the winner now of</text>
  <text start="768.689" dur="4.26">course I believe the Trump</text>
  <text start="771.329" dur="4.68">administration the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.949" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;re gonna be using real hard facts</text>
  <text start="776.009" dur="5.851">and they might even do an investigation</text>
  <text start="778.68" dur="4.98">into the BLS and all the others and find</text>
  <text start="781.86" dur="4.32">out that they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="783.66" dur="4.919">numbers then they might go into the Fed</text>
  <text start="786.18" dur="5.37">to figure out have they been telling us</text>
  <text start="788.579" dur="5.731">the truth and most likely to lead up to</text>
  <text start="791.55" dur="5.37">that they will dig up evidence they will</text>
  <text start="794.31" dur="5.25">present certain facts about the Fed they</text>
  <text start="796.92" dur="6.18">will show other things and maybe they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="799.56" dur="5.339">go into the vaults look to see if</text>
  <text start="803.1" dur="4.109">there&amp;#39;s really gold without minutiae n--</text>
  <text start="804.899" dur="4.591">maybe they will send a team in there and</text>
  <text start="807.209" dur="3.511">it will show that they don&amp;#39;t have gold I</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="4.079">mean there&amp;#39;s so many different things</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="5.489">that they can do to actually put it on</text>
  <text start="813.569" dur="5.791">the Fed and all they need to do is show</text>
  <text start="816.209" dur="6.421">this show the facts and Congress at this</text>
  <text start="819.36" dur="4.829">point will have no choice but to pass</text>
  <text start="822.63" dur="4.37">the audit bill and we know the president</text>
  <text start="824.189" dur="6.12">then would sign the audit bill and</text>
  <text start="827" dur="5.35">basically this is how the narrative can</text>
  <text start="830.309" dur="4.95">be controlled this is how we can get rid</text>
  <text start="832.35" dur="5.099">of the central bank and this is how we</text>
  <text start="835.259" dur="4.411">can push this forward now once again</text>
  <text start="837.449" dur="5.94">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that collapse is not</text>
  <text start="839.67" dur="5.459">going to happen the collapse is coming</text>
  <text start="843.389" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s going to be a transition and</text>
