  <text start="53.64" dur="6.08">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="6.32">report my name is Dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="59.72" dur="5.91">1378 a n today&amp;#39;s date is September 14</text>
  <text start="63.44" dur="5.11">2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.63" dur="5.849">Financial Institutions call for a market</text>
  <text start="68.55" dur="5.25">crash in the next three to eight months</text>
  <text start="71.479" dur="5.051">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.8" dur="5.1">financial news now as we know we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="4.5">seeing retail implode on itself in more</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="5.85">and more stores they are shutting down</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="6.39">and laying off a lot of individuals now</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="4.8">coming up very soon this Friday the</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="4.65">Department of Commerce will report</text>
  <text start="89.55" dur="5.67">August retail sales now remember we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="6.18">had hurricane Harvey we&amp;#39;ve had hurricane</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="6.539">Irma and they&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="5.61">Hurricanes to explain away why the</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="4.741">retail sales aren&amp;#39;t doing well because</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re already getting information from</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="5.22">Bank of America from the internal credit</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="6.6">and debit card spending data that well</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="4.86">the retail numbers they don&amp;#39;t look that</text>
  <text start="115.41" dur="6.11">great</text>
  <text start="116.58" dur="7.499">now Bank of America&amp;#39;s calculation of</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="6.93">retail sales using their credit and</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="6.871">debit information shows that the</text>
  <text start="128.45" dur="5.2">month-on-month retail sales</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="5.97">they have declined by 0.1 percent now</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="5.309">once again we need to understand how</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="5.06">they figure out retail sales these are</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="5.221">not the numbers coming from the actual</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="4.39">retailers especially those that are</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.71">closing down those retailers that are</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="4.5">closing down they spread out those</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="4.5">numbers over the rest of the year so if</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="6.14">stores closed down today they take those</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="6.81">sales and they spread it out over the</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="6.28">next coming months to make it look like</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="5.789">everything is stable but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.65">seeing right now is if you subtract you</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="4.441">know the Hurricanes and this has only</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="4.32">happened in certain locations it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="3.839">happen in the rest of the country it</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="3.87">only happened in Texas in Florida and</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re gonna make this a really big</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="4.889">deal to explain away why this is all</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="5.22">happening now when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="5.671">can see that the real problem is that</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="4.41">people are not spending money like they</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="3.48">used to</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="7.05">and what&amp;#39;s even more disappointing is</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="7.23">that the back-to-school sales well they</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="4.41">have dropped last year they were around</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="2.88">five point four percent this year</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re down to two point four percent</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="5.19">year-on-year so this is down by fifty</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="6.35">percent and basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="6.599">here is that this is a major problem</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="4.78">because they look at this information</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="3.991">the back-to-school sales and they</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="3.72">project out how the rest of the year is</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="3.63">going to how the rest of the year is</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="4.41">going to go and right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="6.15">seeing the rest of the year is not going</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="5.399">to be going that well and they can blame</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="3.33">this on the weather they like to do this</text>
  <text start="227.459" dur="4.381">I&amp;#39;d like to say well it was the storms</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="3.899">fault it was because of this but when we</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="7.2">really look at this we could see that</text>
  <text start="233.069" dur="8.67">even in June in July August sales were</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="6.24">down because people weren&amp;#39;t spending</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="5.491">actually things started to stall and yes</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="3.06">will they pick up in the coming months</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="2.729">yes because we&amp;#39;re heading into the</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="3.989">holiday season we&amp;#39;re heading into</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="4.741">Halloween we head back to school</text>
  <text start="252.329" dur="5.491">but they&amp;#39;re not going to be as strong as</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="7.56">they were before we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="6.96">before in the past years and this</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="3.81">pattern is continuing this is why we see</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="4.44">a lot of the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="7.68">closing remember online sales only make</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="8.19">up 10% of retail sales so they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="6.21">retail as the excuse they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.31">weather as the excuse they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="4.35">the point to the economy or that people</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="3.569">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to go out and</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="5.01">purchase goods they like to point at</text>
  <text start="286.289" dur="5.401">everything else except that that is the</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.17">major problem and again most of the</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="5.22">people&amp;#39;s credit cards they are maxed out</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="5.76">and they are just not spending now Jim</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.129">Rickards is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="6.419">that the next financial crisis is around</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="6.301">six to eight months away and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="5.101">that North Korea might be a trigger</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="4.199">point and he&amp;#39;s saying that yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="5.01">gonna be entering into a financial</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="6.271">crisis in this time period now again</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="5.64">this is a prediction I don&amp;#39;t like to use</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="4.05">predictions I don&amp;#39;t like to say yes</text>
  <text start="321.42" dur="2.79">is going to happen on the state yes</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there saying</text>
  <text start="324.21" dur="2.88">that you know this is when it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="3.87">happen it&amp;#39;s gonna happen in the fall</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s gonna happen in 2018 I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="3.72">look at the indicators and I like to</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="3.51">look at what has been happening over a</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="3.51">period of time now a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="4.17">that I&amp;#39;m predicting stuff but I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="4.26">predicted anything I said this is what I</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="3.57">think might happen from all the</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="3.57">indicators but I&amp;#39;m not predicting</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="3.54">exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen because</text>
  <text start="344.67" dur="4.5">we don&amp;#39;t know exactly when it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="4.86">happen but we can follow the patterns</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="4.14">and we can see that we&amp;#39;re getting closer</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="4.17">and closer we can see how the central</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="3.84">banks were losing control we can see how</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="3.87">the economy is deteriorating I mean if</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="3.99">you go back a couple of reports maybe a</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="5.1">year or two ago we talked about housing</text>
  <text start="361.14" dur="4.77">we talked about retail we seen retail</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="3.18">continually sight now we talked about</text>
  <text start="365.91" dur="2.69">the employment numbers now think about</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="3.99">this for a second</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="6.97">back after the Great Recession back in</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.49">2009 2010 2011 unemployment was around</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="2.79">10% I mean that was the government</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.54">unemployment numbers we know is much</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="4.47">much higher and they said it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="4.14">dropping ever since you know 8 percent 7</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="5.19">percent 6 percent here we are 4 percent</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="7.86">as these numbers dropped and more people</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="10.65">went to work retail while that got worse</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="7.53">housing got worse GDP went nowhere tax</text>
  <text start="398.67" dur="4.71">receipts coming into the government</text>
  <text start="400.14" dur="5.13">declined revenues coming into the</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="5.61">corporation&amp;#39;s their sales their revenues</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="6.93">declined this tells us that those</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="6.69">numbers were manipulated it tells us</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="5.16">that they&amp;#39;ve been lying to us and the</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="3.24">things that we looked at where retail</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="4.11">was getting worse and worse every single</text>
  <text start="418.92" dur="5.07">holiday season we said listen if this</text>
  <text start="421.47" dur="4.92">holds true with what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more stores</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="6.6">closed and it did come true after 2016</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="4.53">going into 2017 all of a sudden there</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="4.05">were thousands and thousands of stores</text>
  <text start="434.88" dur="4.35">that were declaring bankruptcy that were</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="4.56">closing down laying off people and now</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="4.29">we have different cycle analysts saying</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="3.09">you know something this fall something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="4.89">going to happen other people are saying</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="5.82">2018 they&amp;#39;re putting time frames between</text>
  <text start="448.41" dur="3.93">you know three months six months eight</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="4.41">months because what is happening right</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="2.97">now is that the central banks they are</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="3.54">loose</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="5.64">in control they&amp;#39;ve been pumping the</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="4.35">economy with stimulus now none of this</text>
  <text start="460.95" dur="3.15">has been getting to the people this has</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="2.49">been going to the banks has been going</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="2.73">to the stock market it&amp;#39;s been going to</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.32">the housing industry is being on</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="5.07">everywhere except to the people so the</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="4.41">people aren&amp;#39;t really seeing the benefit</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="3.99">of what has been happening now if</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re in the stock market they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="3.06">riding the stock market higher but those</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="3.36">people that have been losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="4.86">well they&amp;#39;re really not seeing a benefit</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="5.58">because they have no jobs now everyone</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="4.41">was seeing a benefit right up to 2008</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="3.48">the market was going up everyone had</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="2.67">their pensions although sales were</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="3">fantastic</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="3.72">housing sales were incredible and then</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="4.59">all of a sudden everything came to a</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="5.43">screeching halt well we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="5.46">see the same exact thing because what</text>
  <text start="500.04" dur="4.56">has been happening we&amp;#39;ve been seeing I</text>
  <text start="503.04" dur="4.35">mean looking at all the economic</text>
  <text start="504.6" dur="6.27">indicators they&amp;#39;re equal to or worse</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="7.76">than 2008 now city is out there and</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re calculating odds of the market</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="5.23">correcting and they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="5.61">is going to happen most likely in the</text>
  <text start="520.38" dur="6.48">next three months and they went on to</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="6.66">say that yesterday was a historic day</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="4.86">for the sp500 not only did the index</text>
  <text start="530.04" dur="4.77">closed at a new record high but it was</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="6.35">also 269 percent higher than its</text>
  <text start="534.81" dur="5.7">generational lows of March 2009</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="4.84">surpassing the two hundred and sixty-six</text>

  <text start="545.88" dur="4.14">an analysis looking at these two</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="5.76">variables and notes that while many</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="5.46">economic indicators are poor and many of</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="5.49">them are poor predictors of Corrections</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.94">there are a handful of reliable signals</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="4.59">to keep an eye on starting with the Y</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="4.19">the bank writes that there are two</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="6.12">things that precede most Corrections</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="7.09">tapash valuations and warning earnings</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="5.7">growth especially as they impact credit</text>
  <text start="572.7" dur="5.82">of which both are amply present</text>
  <text start="575.46" dur="6.39">currently now as a reminder central</text>
  <text start="578.52" dur="6.81">banks are pulling the plug as we speak</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re basically tapering their</text>
  <text start="585.33" dur="4.22">stimulus this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="5.45">telling us if they actually</text>
  <text start="589.55" dur="5.79">and guess what happens the whole thing</text>
  <text start="591.95" dur="6.93">completely falls apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.34" dur="6.21">saying that once this does occur well</text>
  <text start="598.88" dur="5.25">the odds of a correction in the next</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="5.46">three months have now risen to forty</text>
  <text start="604.13" dur="5.61">five percent now remember the central</text>
  <text start="607.01" dur="4.95">bank is manipulating the economy they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="4.47">been pumping stimulus into the economy</text>

  <text start="618.74" dur="3.84">comes to a screeching halt if they</text>
  <text start="620.03" dur="3.87">continue on their track well people are</text>
  <text start="622.58" dur="2.7">going to start to realize and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="623.9" dur="2.94">already started to realize because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.28" dur="3.54">seeing a lot of financial institutions</text>
  <text start="626.84" dur="3.54">come out and say we are in trouble we</text>
