  <text start="158.18" dur="4.77">revised the numbers to make the housing</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="4.08">starts look a lot better and they play</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="3.48">with the numbers quite often but when we</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="3.899">look at this overall on the year to year</text>
  <text start="166.43" dur="4.77">basis we&amp;#39;re starting to see a decline in</text>

  <text start="180.769" dur="4.561">interesting is that it may be two or</text>
  <text start="182.989" dur="3.991">three reports back we talked about the</text>
  <text start="185.33" dur="5.12">global</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="5.759">build the curve how it was inverted well</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="4.599">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="5.371">corporate yield curve it has just</text>
  <text start="195.049" dur="5.731">inverted and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="198.11" dur="5.31">in all different areas right now and</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="5.459">when we look once again at a graph when</text>
  <text start="203.42" dur="6.42">the corporate yield curve inverts</text>
  <text start="206.239" dur="7.171">we enter a recession and here we are</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="7.229">once again we&amp;#39;re at that same exact time</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="6.12">period and basically we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="217.069" dur="6.51">running into a huge amount of trouble</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="7.14">here now every trough in the curve has</text>
  <text start="223.579" dur="4.891">always correspond to some market crisis</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="4.289">where that the Asian crisis the tech</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="4.829">bubble the great financial crisis or the</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="5.67">liquidity squeeze we are experiencing</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="5.19">now so every time we see this we see</text>
  <text start="236.629" dur="4.44">something happened now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="5.931">see all these indicators point to the</text>
  <text start="241.069" dur="6.721">same exact thing and Paul Tudor Jones</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="6.459">warns that the next recession it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="5.759">to be really frightening and this is</text>
  <text start="250.879" dur="5.461">coming from global macro trader Paul</text>
  <text start="253.549" dur="6.06">Tudor Jones is warning that the asset</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="5.399">prices are too high he&amp;#39;s concerned about</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="4.74">what the next recession might look like</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="5.251">the market right now is jacked up and</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="5.221">ready to go and he added that it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.51">pouring lighter fluid on an already lit</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="5.79">fire we don&amp;#39;t have any stabilizers</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="4.36">during the financial crisis central</text>
  <text start="275.36" dur="3.779">bank&amp;#39;s had a lot of room to ease</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="4.47">monetary policy and governments had more</text>
  <text start="279.139" dur="4.701">flexibility to push stimulative fiscal</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="6.03">policy today there&amp;#39;s less room and</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.199">flexibility the next recession is really</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="5.4">frightening because we don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="6.091">stabilizers will have monetary policy</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="6.57">which will exhaust really quickly but we</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t have any fiscal stabilizers he</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="4.47">said the one thing I&amp;#39;ve learned over the</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="5.459">last 40 years these price patterns it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="4.08">the same old story so often just with</text>
  <text start="306.139" dur="4.381">different characters different times</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="4.2">different plots and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="310.52" dur="3.81">entering the same thing that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="5.959">in the past and what we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="5.7">past is the entire system implode</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="2.481">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="2.199">everything</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="5.13">that we&amp;#39;ve been discussing all the</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="6.421">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been watching we</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="5.85">are doing the same exact thing that we</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="5.16">did prior to 2008 yes they might have</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="4.44">shuffled things around to make it look a</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="5.819">lot better but they created the same</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="6.21">exact bubbles they are doing the same</text>
  <text start="339.629" dur="3.78">exact thing as they did back in 2008</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="2.88">where they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="343.409" dur="3.931">and then they had to lower the interest</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="4.889">rates because they started an economic</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.65">collapse scenario which turned into the</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="4.261">great financial crisis of 2008 and they</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="4.2">were allowed to start QE during that</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="5.34">period but everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="6.93">watching the inverted yield curve too</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="4.049">much debt everything is pretty much the</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="3.51">same</text>
  <text start="363.569" dur="7.41">I mean it&amp;#39;s rhyming really really well</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="8.159">with what happened back in 2008 and this</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="6.961">all means that this system is not going</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="7.081">to last I mean think about how many</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="6.12">indicators we have covered so far that</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="5.13">have been showing us that we are headed</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="4.02">towards a recession depression collapse</text>
  <text start="387" dur="2.88">now I think we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="3">for quite a while and I think what the</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="3.39">government has done in central banks</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="4.5">have done is they&amp;#39;ve manipulated the</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="4.35">data so much that nobody can even tell</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="4.35">anymore if we&amp;#39;re in a recession until</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="4.56">everything starts to really collapse and</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="5.25">I think that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve done to this</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="5.18">point they&amp;#39;ve manipulated everything so</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="5.28">much the stock market GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="5.919">unemployment numbers corporations been</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="6.03">buying back their own stock faking their</text>
  <text start="413.279" dur="5.73">earnings and their profits the loans</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="5.039">that have been taking out with the</text>
  <text start="419.009" dur="4.831">shadow banking system has been pushed</text>
  <text start="421.529" dur="4.711">off from the big banks onto the little</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.889">banks and they&amp;#39;ve been shuffling all</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="4.47">this stuff around and as the Fed is</text>
  <text start="428.729" dur="4.8">raising rates and as they&amp;#39;re tightening</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re starting to see cracks in the</text>
  <text start="433.529" dur="6.601">system and as we move forward we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="7.41">gonna see a lot more cracks appear now</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="7.08">Russia and India they&amp;#39;ve made a military</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="6.9">deal and they&amp;#39;ve decided that they were</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="6.689">going to bypass US sanctions by using</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="5.22">the rupee and the ruble in bilateral</text>
  <text start="453.899" dur="5.58">trade involving their military equipment</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="4.739">deal some two billion in weapons deals</text>
  <text start="459.479" dur="3.891">between India and Russia have been hit</text>
  <text start="461.039" dur="4.771">as a result of the recent US sanctions</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="4.539">so the countries said you know something</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="4.02">why don&amp;#39;t we just bypass this why do we</text>
  <text start="467.909" dur="4.281">need to use the dollar we don&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="5.25">just use another form of currency and</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="4.24">that&amp;#39;s what they did this is how</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="2.85">countries get around all these</text>
  <text start="476.43" dur="4.409">ridiculous sanctions the sanctions</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="5.64">really don&amp;#39;t do anything right now now</text>
  <text start="480.839" dur="5.82">yesterday we mentioned that Russia was</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="5.849">dropping dumping I should say US</text>
  <text start="486.659" dur="4.29">Treasuries and we also noticed that</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="3.391">China and many other countries have been</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="5.52">dumping to US Treasuries but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="5.49">interesting is that Russia came out and</text>
  <text start="496.469" dur="4.051">they gave us the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="3.989">dumping US Treasuries they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="6.119">they&amp;#39;re dumping them because they want</text>
  <text start="502.289" dur="6.69">to keep their reserves safe and the</text>
  <text start="506.639" dur="3.84">Central Bank of Russia went under saying</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="2.791">this used to be a private western</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="1.891">central bank which was controlled by the</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="3.24">Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="512.37" dur="4.38">but Putin stepped in and took control of</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="4.319">the private western central bank and</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="4.77">this is why Russia is the enemy right</text>
  <text start="519.329" dur="3.691">now this is normally what happens is why</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="3.049">the corporate media all those</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="4.41">individuals in the deep state</text>
  <text start="524.569" dur="5.14">continually push the idea that Russia is</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.29">the enemy because they moved away from</text>
  <text start="529.709" dur="4.681">the Roth trial private western central</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="6.69">bank system and any country that does</text>
  <text start="534.39" dur="6.059">this they are now the enemy and what</text>
  <text start="538.41" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is many countries</text>
  <text start="540.449" dur="4.101">out there they&amp;#39;re realizing on their</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="4.86">understanding that they need to</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="5.14">repatriate their gold they need to move</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="4.649">away from the dollar they need to have</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="5.009">bilateral trade with other countries</text>
  <text start="551.819" dur="7.291">outside of the dollar and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="554.699" dur="8.401">doing this to protect themselves so this</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="7.07">next collapse of the system it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="6.859">to be very difficult for many people and</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="6.909">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about getting gold</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="6.101">getting supplies making sure you have</text>
  <text start="573.089" dur="5.671">water getting toiletry medical supplies</text>

  <text start="578.76" dur="2.67">system starts to break down and believe</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="2.699">in the corporate media is not going to</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="3.3">be on the news saying hey by the way the</text>

  <text start="596.07" dur="5.07">possible second when everything is</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.16">falling apart that&amp;#39;s when they&amp;#39;ll say oh</text>
  <text start="601.14" dur="3.87">look the stock market came down as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="2.82">been seeing it&amp;#39;s button bobbing up and</text>

  <text start="623.58" dur="3.54">cryptocurrencies you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="625.47" dur="4.26">get food because what happens in these</text>

  <text start="652.589" dur="3.961">get rid of it they&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="5.52">interest rates right now like they did</text>
  <text start="656.55" dur="6.51">prior to 2008 we&amp;#39;re seeing all the same</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="5.22">signs that we&amp;#39;ve seen before this tells</text>
  <text start="663.06" dur="5.279">us that we&amp;#39;re going to be going into a</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="5.55">credit crisis once again and once again</text>
  <text start="668.339" dur="4.351">depending on who has the narrative</text>
  <text start="670.71" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are going to steer</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="5.13">this collapse this is not about avoiding</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="6">the collapse or putting the collapse on</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="7.38">hold this is about steering the entire</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="6.72">population through this next recession</text>
  <text start="685.2" dur="5.61">through this next collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="4.44">and this is going to be a collapse of</text>
  <text start="690.81" dur="3.2">the central banking system and we need</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="3.33">to remember the central banking system</text>
  <text start="694.01" dur="3.13">they would like to have the narrative</text>
  <text start="696" dur="2.85">because they want to start this whole</text>
  <text start="697.14" dur="4.53">system over again they thought they were</text>
  <text start="698.85" dur="3.81">going to have a better story because</text>
  <text start="701.67" dur="2.97">they thought they were gonna use an</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="5.34">event like war or something like that to</text>
  <text start="704.64" dur="5.16">explain away why their system failed but</text>
  <text start="708" dur="4.5">they won&amp;#39;t tell you it failed but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.8" dur="5.58">the whole reason it failed and why they</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="4.41">needed to restart at someplace else that</text>
  <text start="715.38" dur="3.86">they were going to make up a whole story</text>
  <text start="716.91" dur="4.11">and how everyone needed to you know</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="5.59">buckle in</text>
  <text start="721.02" dur="6.75">everyone needed to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="724.83" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s why supplies aren&amp;#39;t coming into</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="5.43">the stores this is why you can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="729.57" dur="5.16">fuel if you go back to 1971 they own the</text>
  <text start="733.2" dur="2.79">narrative back then and they made up all</text>
  <text start="734.73" dur="3.51">these different stories to tell you why</text>
  <text start="735.99" dur="3.96">we were coming off the gold standard on</text>
  <text start="738.24" dur="3.06">to the petrodollar system but they</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="4.02">really didn&amp;#39;t tell you that they just</text>
  <text start="741.3" dur="4.41">told you that they were taking us off</text>
  <text start="743.97" dur="4.26">the gold standard because of speculators</text>
  <text start="745.71" dur="6.09">and we were having fuel shortages people</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="5.97">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs we saw huge inflation</text>
  <text start="751.8" dur="4.56">interest rates were very high but they</text>
  <text start="754.2" dur="5.19">never really explained what was really</text>
  <text start="756.36" dur="5.85">going on and the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="759.39" dur="5.04">happen this time but it depends on who</text>
  <text start="762.21" dur="4.41">has the narrative if the central banks</text>
  <text start="764.43" dur="4.83">have the narrative that means the Trump</text>
  <text start="766.62" dur="4.47">administration lost that means the</text>
  <text start="769.26" dur="4.14">central bank has the control the deep</text>
  <text start="771.09" dur="4.02">state has control and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="773.4" dur="3.42">make up a story to tell you why all of</text>
  <text start="775.11" dur="4.53">this is happening most likely blame this</text>
  <text start="776.82" dur="4.86">on Trump and Russia and whatever else</text>
  <text start="779.64" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re going to make up if Trump has</text>
  <text start="781.68" dur="4.98">the narrative basically they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="784.32" dur="4.68">tell you that we&amp;#39;re coming off a central</text>
  <text start="786.66" dur="4.32">banking system we&amp;#39;re moving on to a</text>
  <text start="789" dur="6.03">people system they might not use those</text>
  <text start="790.98" dur="8.03">words but this all of this is going to</text>
  <text start="795.03" dur="7.34">be done to help the population and</text>
  <text start="799.01" dur="6.49">depending on what they say and how they</text>
  <text start="802.37" dur="6.13">shape the narrative people are going to</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="7.16">understand that this system was built up</text>
  <text start="808.5" dur="7.68">on a phony central bank model and</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="6.07">basically to push this narrative Ford</text>
  <text start="816.18" dur="4.95">the blame will have to be on the central</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="4.68">banking system where there might need to</text>
  <text start="821.13" dur="3.54">be an audit to see what they were</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="3.99">actually doing and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="4.86">gonna find a lot of stuff and once that</text>
  <text start="827.4" dur="3.75">stuff comes out they will be able to</text>
  <text start="829.53" dur="3.9">shape the narrative and I think this is</text>
  <text start="831.15" dur="4.35">how they&amp;#39;re going to work here and this</text>
  <text start="833.43" dur="5.46">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do so this is</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="6.54">not about you know stopping the collapse</text>
  <text start="838.89" dur="5.61">this is not about diverting us to</text>
  <text start="842.04" dur="7.38">something else this is about navigating</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="6.39">us through this transition and we will</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="3.48">need to be navigated through this</text>
  <text start="850.89" dur="3.81">transition because it is going to be</text>
  <text start="852.9" dur="3.75">quite rough and for those P</text>
  <text start="854.7" dur="3.66">who aren&amp;#39;t prepared it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="856.65" dur="3.99">very difficult think about what Russia</text>
  <text start="858.36" dur="3.99">went through when they were coming off</text>
  <text start="860.64" dur="3.45">their old system and bringing into a new</text>
  <text start="862.35" dur="4.16">system a lot of people couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="5.67">food there were no there was no food or</text>
  <text start="866.51" dur="5.44">items on the shelves of stores people</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="4.26">can get funds out of the bank we saw</text>
  <text start="871.95" dur="4.5">this in many other countries we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="874.02" dur="5.64">go through the same exact thing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.45" dur="4.29">going to be a very bumpy ride and for</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="2.76">those people who are not prepared</text>
  <text start="880.74" dur="3.42">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="882.42" dur="4.68">difficult for these individuals think</text>
  <text start="884.16" dur="5.31">about the Great Depression when people</text>
  <text start="887.1" dur="4.8">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs and people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.47" dur="4.44">get food people didn&amp;#39;t have money they</text>
  <text start="891.9" dur="4.77">were having they needed to have other</text>
  <text start="893.91" dur="4.71">people live in their homes to help make</text>
  <text start="896.67" dur="4.98">ends meet we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through</text>
  <text start="898.62" dur="4.59">the same exact thing and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="901.65" dur="3.27">be very difficult for many many people</text>
  <text start="903.21" dur="4.14">who aren&amp;#39;t prepared especially those</text>
  <text start="904.92" dur="4.8">people who haven&amp;#39;t really been paying</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="4.8">attention so you need to be ready you</text>
  <text start="909.72" dur="4.62">need to be prepared to be brought</text>
  <text start="912.15" dur="4.59">through this transition and hopefully</text>
  <text start="914.34" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ll get through it in one piece if we</text>
