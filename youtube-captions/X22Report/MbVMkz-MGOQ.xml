  <text start="18.06" dur="2.059">you</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="4.98">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="52.2" dur="4.83">when he to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="6.119">this is episode 1202 and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="5.22">februari 12 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="4.651">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="4.89">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.189">economic collapse news now last week the</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="5.97">job numbers came out and they moved up</text>
  <text start="69.899" dur="4.561">to four point eight percent and yes they</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3.21">are saying that there were two hundred</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="6.78">twenty-seven thousand jobs that were</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="6.87">created however this increase in jobs it</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="5.4">might be the only positive thing in the</text>
  <text start="83.19" dur="4.47">report and is it really that positive no</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="4.229">because a lot of these jobs are</text>
  <text start="87.66" dur="5.76">part-time and there are two other issues</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="5.491">that really haven&amp;#39;t been highlighted</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.77">with these job numbers two issues that</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="3.99">could and probably will have an impact</text>
  <text start="98.19" dur="5.58">on the interest rate decisions later</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="5.76">this year first the unemployment rate in</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="5.69">the u.s. actually increased from 4.7 to</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="6.72">4.8 despite this incredible job growth</text>
  <text start="109.46" dur="5.53">how is this possible simply well the</text>
  <text start="112.83" dur="4.649">bureau of labor statistics it gathered</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="4.169">its data and about 700,000 people have</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="3.96">been removed from the civilian</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="4.291">population the total size of the</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="5.911">civilian population is rebalanced on a</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="6.449">yearly basis in january now the smaller</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="4.979">size of the civilian population caused</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="4.711">the labor force participation rate to</text>
  <text start="132.329" dur="4.051">increase by 0.2% and this by itself</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="5.82">caused the unemployment rate to increase</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="7.02">as well despite the incredible jobs that</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="4.589">were created and as the unemployment</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="3.54">rate is one of the key factors in the</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="3.331">federal reserve as are looking to</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="3.329">determine you know should they raise the</text>
  <text start="148.35" dur="4.259">rates or not raise the rates this small</text>
  <text start="150.269" dur="6.181">increase could have an impact on their</text>
  <text start="152.609" dur="8.1">decision now we know they just use this</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="6.27">as a gauge they really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="160.709" dur="5.101">raise rates until they bring the economy</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="4.38">down and of course you have to go back</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="2.85">in time remember when the Federal</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="4.08">Reserve said oh yes we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="5.22">raising rates when we hit six percent</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.89">when we hit five and a half percent and</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="4.8">here we are at four point eight percent</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="4.74">where in all pens purposes when you look</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="3.75">back in time this is full employment but</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re still having a problem</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="5.039">should tell you something now even more</text>
  <text start="184.349" dur="4.851">importantly is the is the extremely</text>
  <text start="187.469" dur="5.16">disappointing update on the average</text>
  <text start="189.2" dur="6.94">hourly earnings now the average hourly</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="5.541">earnings increase fell 2.1 percent in</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="5.45">January on a month-to-month comparison</text>
  <text start="198.17" dur="6.429">but the real catch is in the details</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="5.289">because the point 1 percent increase is</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="4.051">focusing on a monthly update the</text>
  <text start="206.879" dur="4.14">revision of the wage increase in</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="5.16">December is actually telling you</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="5.461">something more serious is going on the</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="5.459">December wages have been revised down by</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="5.369">0.2% so if that would not have happened</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="6.75">the average hourly wage would have</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="6.84">decreased in January the official</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="7.231">inflation estimate well that&amp;#39;s hovering</text>
  <text start="228.689" dur="7.651">around 2.3 to 2.5% by the end of 2017</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="4.859">and is really easy to see and understand</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="4.709">the inflation will eat a lot of the</text>
  <text start="238.109" dur="6.96">wealth of the lower income class and the</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="5.78">middle class and when we look at what</text>
  <text start="245.069" dur="6.151">they expect over the next five years</text>
  <text start="246.829" dur="6.31">with inflation well they see inflation</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="4.979">moving up which is going to eat into</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="5.701">disposable income it will eat away at</text>
  <text start="256.199" dur="4.771">two percent of the families purchasing</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="4.34">power and you don&amp;#39;t have to be a genius</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="4.71">to see this could go terribly wrong as</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="5.26">declining purchasing power will reduce</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="4.62">the so-called disposable income causing</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="4.83">the band for non-essential goods to</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="5.19">increase so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is wages</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="4.619">are stalling this means inflation is</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="5.549">eating away the people&amp;#39;s purchasing</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="5.221">power and savings and as we move forward</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="4.741">this is going to get worse and this is</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="6.69">why Jim Rogers is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="6.27">saying get prepared what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="5.609">because we&amp;#39;re going to have the worst</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="6.679">economic problems in your lifetime and a</text>
  <text start="295.409" dur="5.82">lot of people are going to disappear I</text>
  <text start="298.729" dur="7.03">mean think about this for a second what</text>
  <text start="301.229" dur="9.271">he&amp;#39;s saying here because people will not</text>
  <text start="305.759" dur="9.001">be able to afford food people will not</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="5.58">be able to get food inflation is going</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="4.469">to surge</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="6.48">and the next time around it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="7.771">be absolutely awful and he says when you</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="6.3">start having bear market and you hear</text>
  <text start="327" dur="3.569">one piece of bad news then you hear</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="4.14">another piece of bad news he goes well</text>
  <text start="330.569" dur="5.16">these things tend to snowbowl and things</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.969">rapidly deteriorate as we go move</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="5.19">forward because if you go back to 2008</text>
  <text start="337.969" dur="6.1">remember with Bear Stearns one piece of</text>
  <text start="340.919" dur="5.581">bad news Lehman Brothers another piece</text>
  <text start="344.069" dur="4.56">of bad news and remember barristers they</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="4.889">were around for 90 years Lehman Brothers</text>
  <text start="348.629" dur="5.211">around for a hundred and fifty years I</text>
  <text start="351.389" dur="7.08">mean they&amp;#39;ve been through Wars</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="9.669">depression the silver war yet they</text>
  <text start="358.469" dur="7.861">disappeared and this is what happens</text>
  <text start="363.509" dur="5.25">when we go down this path of this</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.369">collapse of the system things are going</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="4.741">to snowball the news is going to get</text>
  <text start="371.699" dur="4.59">worse companies are going to be laying</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="7.55">off and everything&amp;#39;s going to start to</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="9.18">really deteriorate very very quickly now</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="6.85">Trump put out this list of 72 terrorists</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="3.991">and he&amp;#39;s saying well these 72 terrorists</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="4.319">came from the country is covered by the</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="3.84">Trump on a travel ban of that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.219" dur="3.151">what everyone&amp;#39;s calling it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="4.589">Muslim ban it&amp;#39;s not even a travel ban</text>
  <text start="395.37" dur="5.099">it&amp;#39;s a temporary ban from these</text>
  <text start="397.889" dur="4.381">countries and the federal judge judge</text>
  <text start="400.469" dur="3.66">robart said there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="3.69">whatsoever that there were any</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="3.391">terrorists from these countries now we</text>
  <text start="405.96" dur="4.259">all know because we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="5.009">this for a very long time that most of</text>
  <text start="410.219" dur="3.87">these individuals are Patsy&amp;#39;s yes there</text>
  <text start="412.529" dur="2.521">could be people that are very angry with</text>
  <text start="414.089" dur="2.61">the United States because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="4.01">creating war throughout these Middle</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="6.991">Eastern countries but a lot of these</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="9.19">incidents these events were created and</text>
  <text start="423.69" dur="7.71">produced by these agencies CIA FBI and</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="4.44">they were patsies and they said oh look</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="3.15">we just found another one we arrested</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="3.39">him now we see the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="3.239">out there saying all of these 72 people</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="4.28">completely fake if the whole the whole</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="6.211">story was phony he has no real evidence</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="6.369">well it looks like the corporate media</text>
  <text start="444" dur="5.61">once again well they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="446.729" dur="6.21">telling the truth because</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="6.149">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="452.939" dur="5.22">review of the Senate committee which</text>
  <text start="455.759" dur="5.43">they compiled all this information in</text>
  <text start="458.159" dur="4.771">2016 reveals that 72 individuals from</text>
  <text start="461.189" dur="4.41">the seven countries covered in president</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="4.829">Trump&amp;#39;s vetting executive order have</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="5.761">been convicted in terror cases since</text>
  <text start="467.759" dur="6.72">nine eleven the center has extracted</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="6.72">information on 72 individuals named in</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="5.87">the Senate report and the report is out</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="6.199">there and they name the countries</text>
  <text start="480.349" dur="7.63">somalia 20 individuals yemen 19 iraq 19</text>
  <text start="484.279" dur="6.491">syria seven Iran for Libya to Sudan won</text>
  <text start="487.979" dur="4.951">a total of seventy-two and according to</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="5.16">the report at least 17 individuals</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="6.09">entered as refugees from these countries</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="4.59">and we know a lot of them were patsies</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.389">we know that these are a lot of false</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.44">flags we know they will bring them in</text>
  <text start="502.409" dur="5.76">and there was a battle going on because</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="5.299">they wanted refugees coming in but they</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="4.261">couldn&amp;#39;t say they were part of the</text>
  <text start="510.259" dur="4.601">terrorism was going on so we had two</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="4.5">different agencies with two different</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="4.38">agendas going on at the same time just</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="4.44">like when an event would occur and there</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="4.679">would be weapons involved we had the</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="4.89">people with the gun ban and then we had</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="5.131">the people with oh this is from the</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="4.319">Islamic state and it would clash because</text>
  <text start="529.05" dur="3.479">if it was from the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="3.271">they were using weapons when you think</text>
  <text start="532.529" dur="3.841">it would make sense for every American</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.38">to have a weapon to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="3.75">against terrorists and then you have the</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="4.56">gun ban people saying oh no we should</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="5.55">ban people because these people are</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.22">using weapons so their stories got all</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="3.9">collided and mixed up and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="3.6">keep the narrative the stories very</text>
  <text start="549.57" dur="5.04">straight but what we can see right now</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="6.9">is that this report does show that Trump</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="7.14">was telling the truth and this report</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="8.79">came from the Senate now we know that</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="8.519">trumps travel temporary ban well that</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="5.37">was shot down by the Ninth Circuit Court</text>
  <text start="570.269" dur="5.041">of Appeals and they ruled to continue</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="5.75">blocking enforcement up trumps travel</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="6.36">ban well they did not strike it down</text>
  <text start="578.42" dur="4.63">this is a procedural order granting a</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="4.2">stay until</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="4.08">all the ramifications are decided the</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="2.79">unanimous decision of the Court of</text>
  <text start="587.13" dur="3.57">Appeals simply means that the state</text>
  <text start="588.66" dur="4.41">preventing a ban on immigration the</text>
  <text start="590.7" dur="5.13">media is turning this into a decision</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="5.22">that means Trump is wrong and the order</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="5.249">is illegal in total and we know that</text>
  <text start="598.29" dur="5.91">they left something very important out</text>
  <text start="601.079" dur="6.57">and that was actually the law that the</text>
  <text start="604.2" dur="5.129">president has the right to ban aliens so</text>
  <text start="607.649" dur="4.711">something very interesting just happened</text>
  <text start="609.329" dur="5.671">a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.71">Appeals has made a request that a vote</text>
  <text start="615" dur="4.14">be taken as to whether the order issued</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="6.48">by the three judges Thursday night</text>
  <text start="619.14" dur="8.189">should be reconsidered as n bank now in</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="5.67">law and bank means that the case is</text>
  <text start="627.329" dur="4.19">going to be heard before all the judges</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="6.48">of the court rather than a panel of</text>
  <text start="631.519" dur="7.421">judges selected from them so this means</text>
  <text start="635.7" dur="6.15">that this judge who doesn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="638.94" dur="6.81">named it&amp;#39;s going to put this to the</text>
  <text start="641.85" dur="5.94">other eleven federal judges and this is</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="4.26">probably one reason why Trump is not</text>
  <text start="647.79" dur="4.56">rewriting the executive order he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="4.59">going to the Supreme Court and we see</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="4.859">that Chief Judge Sidney Thomas of the</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="5.13">9th cir Ninth Circuit Court has</text>
  <text start="657.209" dur="5.13">instructed Trump and the Department of</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="8.01">Justice team and lawyers to put together</text>
  <text start="662.339" dur="8.581">briefs to file them and he has until the</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="6.27">16th to do this and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="6.69">judge came forward right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.01" dur="6.35">remaining anonymous and he told Trump</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="7.53">and this team what to do because</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="7.75">something doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with this</text>
  <text start="685.14" dur="5.1">judge and the ruling and what was left</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="5.789">out in the ruling because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="690.24" dur="8.219">even cite the law and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="693.899" dur="7.711">going to go to a much larger group of</text>
  <text start="698.459" dur="7.56">judges to make the decision which is</text>
  <text start="701.61" dur="7.62">very interesting on how this is moving</text>
  <text start="706.019" dur="5.731">along here because we know the elite the</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="5.37">opposition you can see it I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="4.62">plain as day that they are picking at</text>
  <text start="714.6" dur="6.179">every little thing</text>
  <text start="716.37" dur="6.6">and trying to squeeze Trump and to show</text>
  <text start="720.779" dur="3.451">that he&amp;#39;s wrong and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="722.97" dur="3.18">leaks that are coming out of his</text>
  <text start="724.23" dur="4.62">administration which are the Obama</text>
  <text start="726.15" dur="4.2">leftovers and they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="728.85" dur="4.53">whatever they possibly can and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="5.07">bringing up every little thing now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="3.39">not saying Trump is perfect I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="735.42" dur="2.97">agree with him on a lot of different</text>
  <text start="736.77" dur="4.44">things I don&amp;#39;t agree that he has all</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="6.51">these Goldman Sachs individuals that</text>
  <text start="741.21" dur="6.12">he&amp;#39;s brought with him I don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="744.9" dur="4.89">the torture part of it but we can see</text>
  <text start="747.33" dur="7.05">that the corporate media is playing to</text>
  <text start="749.79" dur="8.07">one side and always has been we see that</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="7.13">this is going on throughout Europe where</text>
  <text start="757.86" dur="7.38">their corporate media out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.51" dur="7.65">putting together news stories like the</text>
  <text start="765.24" dur="9">BBC and the rest and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="769.16" dur="6.76">create a story about Russia interfering</text>
  <text start="774.24" dur="4.17">with their elections now we know France</text>
  <text start="775.92" dur="4.74">and Germany their elections are coming</text>
  <text start="778.41" dur="6.21">up later this year and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.1">make it seem like Russia is interfering</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="4.65">in all the elections and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="785.76" dur="5.4">happening here is that the people well</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re deciding that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="791.16" dur="5.7">these leaders anymore and the elite the</text>
  <text start="794.07" dur="4.8">central bank they don&amp;#39;t like this they</text>
  <text start="796.86" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen this is why</text>
  <text start="798.87" dur="6.08">they&amp;#39;re trying to shut down social media</text>
  <text start="800.79" dur="9.81">anything that is said against these</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="7.81">leaders they shut it down they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="3.72">want free speech I mean this is totally</text>
  <text start="812.76" dur="3.09">obvious of what they&amp;#39;re trying to do of</text>
  <text start="814.32" dur="3.93">course they&amp;#39;re calling it fake news</text>
  <text start="815.85" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re building this up but we can see</text>
  <text start="818.25" dur="6.27">where this is going now here in the</text>
  <text start="820.92" dur="6.87">United States the US military they have</text>
  <text start="824.52" dur="5.04">announced they expect civil unrest in</text>
  <text start="827.79" dur="4.14">this country to become a major problem</text>
  <text start="829.56" dur="5.04">in cities across America in the very</text>
  <text start="831.93" dur="5.69">near future and they begun training the</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="6.05">police to prepare for urban warfare and</text>
  <text start="837.62" dur="5.44">in southern Indiana the army had built a</text>
  <text start="840.65" dur="4.63">dedicated 1,000 acre urban warfare</text>
  <text start="843.06" dur="3.6">training center that contains houses</text>
  <text start="845.28" dur="4.47">apartment building schools and hospitals</text>
  <text start="846.66" dur="5.48">and they&amp;#39;ve been training with</text>
  <text start="849.75" dur="5.46">in these settings for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="6.19">the question is why why are they doing</text>
  <text start="855.21" dur="5.28">this because they understand that when</text>
  <text start="858.33" dur="4.35">this system collapses they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="860.49" dur="4.77">have to try to maintain control of the</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="6.09">situation because people who can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="865.26" dur="5.97">food people who lose their jobs people</text>
  <text start="868.77" dur="4.05">who lose their life savings people who</text>
  <text start="871.23" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="4.74">going to be very upset about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.32" dur="5.88">going on and you will see riots you will</text>
  <text start="877.56" dur="5.1">see people angry now will this happen in</text>
  <text start="880.2" dur="6.42">the first week most likely not because i</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="5.87">was there in 2013 in Manhattan when we</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="5.37">had the blackout on the East Coast and</text>
  <text start="888.53" dur="7.66">in the city itself I was there for two</text>
  <text start="891.99" dur="6.15">days two nights and most of the people</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="3.93">were in a good mood but I saw on the</text>
  <text start="898.14" dur="5.57">last day people were getting agitated</text>
  <text start="900.12" dur="5.97">people were getting a little pissed off</text>
  <text start="903.71" dur="4.54">because they wanted their electric back</text>
  <text start="906.09" dur="4.83">on and a lot of the generators have run</text>
  <text start="908.25" dur="4.17">out of fuel a lot of the restaurants had</text>
  <text start="910.92" dur="3.72">no more food to offer because they were</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="4.23">handing it out or selling it for like</text>
  <text start="914.64" dur="3.21">beers were for like a dollar and other</text>
  <text start="916.65" dur="3">food they were just giving away for free</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="3.42">because they couldn&amp;#39;t keep it frozen or</text>
  <text start="919.65" dur="3.3">refrigerated anymore but when that</text>
  <text start="921.27" dur="3.15">started to run out in the excitement of</text>
  <text start="922.95" dur="3.36">like oh look i&amp;#39;m getting the street food</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="5.61">people started to get really upset so in</text>
  <text start="926.31" dur="5.49">the beginning people will be in an okay</text>
  <text start="930.03" dur="3.059">mood because they&amp;#39;ll think that</text>
  <text start="931.8" dur="2.43">everything will be fine and of course</text>
  <text start="933.089" dur="2.851">the government will come out and say</text>
  <text start="934.23" dur="3.48">everything will be fine later on but as</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="3.42">we move forward things are going to</text>
  <text start="937.71" dur="3.51">start to break down and this is why the</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="4.35">police have been training now we see</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="5.4">North to North Korea they have fired a</text>
  <text start="943.71" dur="6.09">ballistic missile and they have fired</text>
  <text start="946.62" dur="6.75">this into the Sea of Japan and what</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="953.37" dur="3.81">being reported hands it off the Trump</text>
  <text start="955.2" dur="3.69">because they need him to do something</text>
  <text start="957.18" dur="4.5">now think about the United States just</text>
  <text start="958.89" dur="5.18">fired a missile into the Pacific Ocean</text>
  <text start="961.68" dur="5.46">towards China to the Marshall Islands</text>
  <text start="964.07" dur="5.35">well North Korea is testing their</text>
  <text start="967.14" dur="4.199">missile systems it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="969.42" dur="4.2">going to attack actually it would be</text>
  <text start="971.339" dur="3.841">kind of ridiculous to attack and to fire</text>
  <text start="973.62" dur="3.99">a missile in United States because in a</text>
  <text start="975.18" dur="5.13">split second going north korea would be</text>
  <text start="977.61" dur="6.03">completely wiped out so it makes no</text>
  <text start="980.31" dur="6.24">sense for them to even try this</text>
  <text start="983.64" dur="4.68">now iran says that russia they can use</text>
  <text start="986.55" dur="3.48">their airspace to bomb the terrorists</text>
  <text start="988.32" dur="4.08">but what i think is happening is that</text>
  <text start="990.03" dur="5.67">Iran is saying listen bring your forces</text>
  <text start="992.4" dur="7.05">into Iran this is not a temporary type</text>
  <text start="995.7" dur="6.87">of mission this will be a long drawn-out</text>
  <text start="999.45" dur="6.39">mission where Russian forces will stay</text>
  <text start="1002.57" dur="5.07">on the air base because Iran understands</text>
  <text start="1005.84" dur="5.13">that the elite the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1007.64" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ll be pushing war in this area and</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="3.87">they want to be ready and prepared for</text>
  <text start="1013.37" dur="3.69">this and if Russia has their forces</text>
  <text start="1014.84" dur="3.9">there well this is going to make a</text>
  <text start="1017.06" dur="5.07">little bit tougher and we have to</text>
  <text start="1018.74" dur="6.12">remember the p5 plus one deal was to</text>
  <text start="1022.13" dur="6.15">have Iran use the dollar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="5.13">dumping it come March and they knew</text>
  <text start="1028.28" dur="3.36">right after Syria they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="1029.99" dur="3.63">into Iran and they definitely do not</text>
  <text start="1031.64" dur="3.66">want Iran creating any type of nuclear</text>
  <text start="1033.62" dur="4.2">weapon because it&amp;#39;s much harder to</text>
  <text start="1035.3" dur="5.34">invade a nuclear state that has a</text>
  <text start="1037.82" dur="6.389">nuclear weapon and to have regime change</text>
  <text start="1040.64" dur="5.73">in that area and we see the economist&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.209" dur="5.071">right now well the last time they had a</text>
  <text start="1046.37" dur="4.71">picture of Trump throwing a Molotov</text>
  <text start="1049.28" dur="4.26">cocktail saying the insurgent in the</text>
  <text start="1051.08" dur="5.96">White House now they&amp;#39;re back to the</text>
  <text start="1053.54" dur="7.68">story about being a Putin puppet and</text>
  <text start="1057.04" dur="7.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to take Trump and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="5.31">trying to meld them along with Putin to</text>
  <text start="1064.67" dur="3.54">say that they&amp;#39;re best buddies and this</text>
  <text start="1066.53" dur="6.06">is why we continue these stories out</text>
  <text start="1068.21" dur="7.62">there where Oh Putin has a gift to trump</text>
  <text start="1072.59" dur="5.37">that they might allow Snowden to come</text>
  <text start="1075.83" dur="4.95">back to the United States and it turns</text>
  <text start="1077.96" dur="5.52">out that this story is completely fake</text>
  <text start="1080.78" dur="5.1">phony and false once again because the</text>
  <text start="1083.48" dur="5.34">corporate media is trying to create this</text>
  <text start="1085.88" dur="4.89">image just like he&amp;#39;s a racist he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1088.82" dur="3.81">misogynist Pig and everything else</text>
  <text start="1090.77" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to create this image and</text>
  <text start="1092.63" dur="4.68">you can see how they are doing this the</text>
  <text start="1095.33" dur="3.9">corporate media right now is in line</text>
  <text start="1097.31" dur="4.74">with the elite the central bankers and</text>
  <text start="1099.23" dur="6.36">it is completely office and what we have</text>
  <text start="1102.05" dur="4.98">right now is a battle between the truth</text>
  <text start="1105.59" dur="3.66">that is coming out just like the story</text>
  <text start="1107.03" dur="4.08">about the 72 terrorists that were</text>
  <text start="1109.25" dur="3.12">arrested where the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="1111.11" dur="3.48">all over that saying this was completely</text>
  <text start="1112.37" dur="4.23">fake but they didn&amp;#39;t report that wait a</text>
  <text start="1114.59" dur="2.76">minute there was a report from the</text>
  <text start="1116.6" dur="3.87">Senate</text>
  <text start="1117.35" dur="4.59">that yes this did happen because they</text>
  <text start="1120.47" dur="3.329">don&amp;#39;t want to report on that they just</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="3.599">want the propaganda out there they want</text>
  <text start="1123.799" dur="4.171">the propaganda repeated over and over</text>
  <text start="1125.539" dur="5.88">and over that&amp;#39;s what they want people to</text>
  <text start="1127.97" dur="5.01">hear but people as we can see the</text>
  <text start="1131.419" dur="3.39">majority of the people was smarter than</text>
  <text start="1132.98" dur="4.53">that they realize what&amp;#39;s going on right</text>
  <text start="1134.809" dur="4.141">now just like during the elections when</text>
  <text start="1137.51" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re out there and they were saying</text>
  <text start="1138.95" dur="3.9">that Clinton was ahead look with the</text>
  <text start="1141.2" dur="2.609">polls and it turned out that all their</text>
  <text start="1142.85" dur="3.81">poles and everything they were saying</text>
  <text start="1143.809" dur="4.441">was completely fake but we can see</text>
  <text start="1146.66" dur="4.019">what&amp;#39;s happening right now things are</text>
  <text start="1148.25" dur="5.909">rapidly deteriorating in this country</text>
  <text start="1150.679" dur="5.431">and we can see already that fitch is</text>
  <text start="1154.159" dur="3.811">already saying well if Trump puts his</text>
  <text start="1156.11" dur="3.39">policies forth what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1157.97" dur="3.839">here is he&amp;#39;s going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1159.5" dur="4.409">economy at Mario Draghi&amp;#39;s out there also</text>

  <text start="1163.909" dur="4.711">down the country the IMF is saying the</text>

  <text start="1170.48" dur="4.14">economies are going to come down and we</text>
  <text start="1172.82" dur="3.87">can see already they&amp;#39;re building this up</text>
  <text start="1174.62" dur="6.09">there creating this narrative that when</text>
  <text start="1176.69" dur="6.93">the economy collapses it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
