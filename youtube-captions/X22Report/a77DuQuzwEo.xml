  <text start="128.03" dur="6.81">talking about how Trump has been hitting</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="8.519">the central bank and he started this</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="7.59">back in 2018 where he continually said</text>
  <text start="139.549" dur="5.491">to the people of this country and the</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="5.369">world that the Fed should be lowering</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="5.19">rates the Fed needs to drop the rates</text>
  <text start="147.799" dur="5.211">because we need to be competitive with</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="5.729">other countries and when other countries</text>

  <text start="160.31" dur="4.23">continually hit the Fed and he actually</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="2.82">called out</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="5.309">the central bank letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="7.97">that they are a big problem now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="169.849" dur="7.291">said this before that Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="8.349">they are carefully setting up the</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="8.489">narrative they are planning to take down</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="6.391">the central bank system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="5.761">educating the people now on what the</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="4.98">Federal Reserve is who they are what</text>
  <text start="191.39" dur="4.5">they do and how they have no knowledge</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="4.709">on how the economy actually works</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="6.33">because their business is really not the</text>
  <text start="198.409" dur="6.961">economy their business is controlling</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="5.37">interest rates and their main main</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="4.399">business is creating currency and</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="5.489">loaning it to government that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="209.769" dur="5.231">that&amp;#39;s all they have they don&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="213.079" dur="5.461">anything else they&amp;#39;re into this entire</text>
  <text start="215" dur="7.2">mandate of them keeping inflation low</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="6.059">and having full employment absolutely</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="4.349">ridiculous they just threw that in there</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="4.61">to make it look good and make the people</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="6.03">feel good and those coming into Congress</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="5.081">feel good that we have this central bank</text>
  <text start="232.579" dur="4.321">system that&amp;#39;s working in the best</text>
  <text start="234.29" dur="4.259">interest of the people but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="2.519">impossible for them to even follow</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="4.4">through on this</text>
  <text start="239.419" dur="8.16">first of all take inflation well if</text>
  <text start="242.949" dur="8.32">their currency is being devalued every</text>
  <text start="247.579" dur="6.63">single day and it&amp;#39;s losing its value how</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="4.321">are they going to stop this because as</text>
  <text start="254.209" dur="3.481">they create more and more of this</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.889">currency there&amp;#39;s more currency in</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="4.5">circulation which means it takes more</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="3.06">dollars to pay for those same items and</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="3.75">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing for many</text>
  <text start="263.539" dur="4.891">many years so how are they going to</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="3.509">control this they&amp;#39;re gonna stop creating</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="5.609">currency they&amp;#39;re gonna tell the</text>
  <text start="269.449" dur="5.911">government hey stop borrowing and even</text>
  <text start="274.039" dur="2.431">if they did tell the government to stop</text>
  <text start="275.36" dur="3">borrowing do you think the corrupt</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.02">individuals within government do you</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="2.58">think they&amp;#39;re going to stop absolutely</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="2.88">not</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="5.34">so they can&amp;#39;t control inflation at all</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="6.6">they can hide it they can pretend it</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="6.54">doesn&amp;#39;t exist but we know that it does</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="5.22">exist when am i talking about the 1 to</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="4.529">3% inflation that they keep talking</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="2.86">about this is manipulated I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="3.07">about the in</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="5.79">elation that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing ever</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="7.141">since we came off the gold standard why</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="7.079">do you think automobile prices housing</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.949">prices health insurance college and</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="4.861">everything else why do you think all of</text>
  <text start="312.509" dur="5.91">this has gone up it&amp;#39;s not because it</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="5.789">costs more for these things it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="318.419" dur="4.441">the value of the dollar decreases why do</text>
  <text start="321.569" dur="4.53">you think they needed to move</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="5.369">manufacturing out of the United States</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="4.32">think about it for a second if the</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="3.511">manufacturers stayed here in the United</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="3.96">States and all the products that we had</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="5.85">today were made here in the United</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="5.461">States how much would they cost they</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="5.699">would cost quite a bit it would take a</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="6.569">lot of dollars to produce them and then</text>
  <text start="343.289" dur="6">a lot of dollars to ship them around if</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="5.25">you produce them in another country</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="6.391">where they pay their workers pennies and</text>
  <text start="351.659" dur="8.421">the cost is very very low even to ship</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="7.859">it across an ocean it would look like</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="5.619">the value of the dollar or should say</text>
  <text start="363.539" dur="5.761">the federal Federal Reserve Note it</text>
  <text start="365.699" dur="8.041">hasn&amp;#39;t lost its value that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="7.459">individuals did they kind of tricked the</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="6.2">entire country actually the world and</text>
  <text start="376.759" dur="6.97">then if you add on top of all of this</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="5.83">credit because remember strip away the</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="3.72">credit cards bring the manufacturers</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="3.449">back to United States and have the</text>
  <text start="387.449" dur="3.391">central bank system the way we have it</text>
  <text start="389.219" dur="4.141">today do you know how much all these</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="4.62">products would be people would be like I</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.489">can&amp;#39;t afford this and if you had no</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="5.91">credit you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to live and</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="5.261">this is why they move manufacturers out</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="4.139">of this country or if they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="5.519">manufacturing in this country they</text>
  <text start="405.509" dur="6.38">manufacture a lot of the parts outside</text>
  <text start="408.629" dur="6.181">of the country to cut down on the cost</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="6.731">because the value of the dollar has lost</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="7.25">its value and this is why today when you</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="6.329">go into stores like a mobile phone store</text>
  <text start="422.06" dur="5.38">you&amp;#39;ll see two prices one if you want to</text>
  <text start="424.949" dur="4.14">buy it outright and two if you want to</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="2.94">pay it off actually if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="429.089" dur="3.751">Amazon</text>
  <text start="430.38" dur="6.78">they give you two options pay the full</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="7.59">price or installments everything is</text>
  <text start="437.16" dur="7.98">going to installments why because the</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="8.04">value of the dollar is decreasing every</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="6.24">single day that is inflation and they</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="5.07">tried to cover this up with credit cards</text>
  <text start="451.38" dur="4.23">moving the manufacturers out of here the</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="6.96">central bank does not benefit the people</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="7.89">whatsoever and going back to the Federal</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="7.29">Reserve&amp;#39;s mandate keep full employment</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="6.72">and make sure there&amp;#39;s no inflation they</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t do either of them they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="6.5">the equipment to do any of this the only</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="9.2">thing they can do is create currency and</text>
  <text start="476.72" dur="9.1">loan it to the government and then also</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="6.37">take this same currency and allow other</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="6.99">central banks in other countries to use</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="5.88">it that&amp;#39;s it and I believe what Trump</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="3">and the Patriots have been doing is</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ve been educating the people</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="4.2">letting everyone know that the Federal</text>
  <text start="497.97" dur="5.67">Reserve they are absolutely worthless</text>
  <text start="500.01" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re worse than China now through the</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="4.65">press we all know that China&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="505.98" dur="4.32">darn bad so if the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="6.179">worse than China then they must be</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="5.7">really really bad and if they&amp;#39;re that</text>
  <text start="514.469" dur="3.991">bad and they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516" dur="6.39">doing with the economy everyone</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="5.519">understands that maybe they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="522.39" dur="3.96">everything in the best interest of this</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="6.901">country now Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the agenda to show</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="5.91">that if the Federal Reserve doesn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="6.72">what Trump wants them to do the economy</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="7.26">will suffer Trump wants them to lower</text>
  <text start="540.48" dur="4.8">rates he continually says this he</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.32">actually wants them to go to negative</text>
  <text start="545.28" dur="5.54">will we ever get there maybe maybe not I</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s important right now I</text>
  <text start="550.82" dur="7.87">think the whole entire point of this is</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="8.5">to show that if the Federal Reserve does</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="7.36">what he wants the economy does better</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="4.53">now I&amp;#39;m talking statistically let&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="2.64">get confused here remember this is a</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="3.51">central bank system</text>
  <text start="568.69" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s a manipulated system Trump is</text>
  <text start="571.03" dur="5.28">working the manipulated system he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="7.83">using all their weapons against them so</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="7.35">for the last year he&amp;#39;s been showing the</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="5.24">people that the Federal Reserve is the</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="6">problem and if they don&amp;#39;t follow along</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="5.59">well the economy is not going to do well</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="4.17">and every time they follow along the</text>
  <text start="591.91" dur="5.94">economy does better and better and</text>
  <text start="593.83" dur="8.01">better Trump is calling the shots now</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="7.89">today the Federal Reserve was testifying</text>
  <text start="601.84" dur="6.68">and they told Congress there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="4.8">more rate cuts we&amp;#39;ve heard this before</text>
  <text start="608.52" dur="4.05">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s true we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="5.49">true does it really matter</text>
  <text start="612.57" dur="7.72">think about what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="11.31">have done no matter which way the Fed</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="9.72">turns now they&amp;#39;re in trouble if they go</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="5.27">ahead and they cut rates they just lie</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="5.97">to the American people and to Congress</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="5.62">but it will help Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="5.16">because if they cut rates again what</text>
  <text start="638.23" dur="5.43">happens it&amp;#39;s a drug to the system the</text>
  <text start="641.14" dur="6.12">stock market moves up everything looks</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="6.48">great statistically if the Fed keeps</text>
  <text start="647.26" dur="5.34">their promise and they said okay no more</text>
  <text start="650.14" dur="8.67">rate cuts and the economy starts to</text>
  <text start="652.6" dur="10.08">decline Trump the Patriots they come out</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="6.93">as a winner in all of this because Trump</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="5.52">at that point will tell the world</text>
  <text start="665.74" dur="4.65">through Twitter and through interviews</text>
  <text start="668.2" dur="4.68">that the feds not doing what I want</text>
  <text start="670.39" dur="5.97">because they&amp;#39;re not doing what I want</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="5.37">the entire system is falling apart now</text>
  <text start="676.36" dur="5.4">people will understand this they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="678.25" dur="6.66">it remember everyone is riding on the</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="6.87">confidence high they feel good about the</text>
  <text start="684.91" dur="6.87">economy the recession</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="5.88">is nowhere in sight the mainstream media</text>

  <text start="694.51" dur="4.92">the central bank the deep state and</text>
  <text start="696.31" dur="5.94">manipulating all these statistics Trump</text>
  <text start="699.43" dur="7.19">use the magic wand and allowed the</text>

  <text start="706.62" dur="6.82">he is setting up the Federal Reserve for</text>

  <text start="713.44" dur="6.29">believe that he really wants an audit we</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="7.92">need to refer back to February 22nd 2016</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="6.97">he tweeted out it is so important to</text>

  <text start="736.63" dur="6.42">I believe the Patriots want the Fed to</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="6.39">be audited because by auditing the Fed</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="5.15">having the bill passed and the only way</text>
  <text start="745.63" dur="5.79">you can push this is through a crisis</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="8.17">what would be the crisis if the economy</text>

  <text start="767.38" dur="5.82">people when you hit them in their wallet</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="5.73">and it affects their pensions it affects</text>
  <text start="773.2" dur="5.19">their everyday life where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="775.84" dur="5.73">have a job they can&amp;#39;t have money they</text>
  <text start="778.39" dur="4.62">can&amp;#39;t survive this is when people come</text>
  <text start="781.57" dur="1.92">out of the woodwork and they say enough</text>
  <text start="783.01" dur="2.73">is enough</text>
  <text start="783.49" dur="6.48">Trump knows this the Patriots know this</text>
  <text start="785.74" dur="7.83">we all know this and this will push the</text>
  <text start="789.97" dur="8.49">audit bill do you think Trump is going</text>
  <text start="793.57" dur="8.91">to sign it absolutely Trump right now</text>
  <text start="798.46" dur="7.96">the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve already started the</text>
  <text start="802.48" dur="6.64">set up to audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="5.039">remember we need to go after the source</text>
  <text start="809.12" dur="4.54">without going after the source</text>
  <text start="811.459" dur="5.861">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing is a waste</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="5.099">of time yes we can have a rest yes we</text>
  <text start="817.32" dur="4.019">can get rid of a lot of the deep state</text>
  <text start="818.759" dur="5.76">players but if we don&amp;#39;t get rid of the</text>
  <text start="821.339" dur="5.791">central bank they&amp;#39;ll rise up again</text>
  <text start="824.519" dur="5.671">through corruption it happens every</text>
  <text start="827.13" dur="6.48">single time we need to go to the source</text>
  <text start="830.19" dur="6.78">of the problem and having a central bank</text>
  <text start="833.61" dur="7.44">control countries put countries into</text>
  <text start="836.97" dur="7.38">debt allowing government to spend like</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="6.17">crazy pocket money and have certain</text>
  <text start="844.35" dur="8.57">funds misdirected into different areas</text>
  <text start="847.22" dur="8.679">that grows corruption this is why</text>
  <text start="852.92" dur="5.339">trumping the Patriots have to go after</text>
  <text start="855.899" dur="6.211">the source and I believe at this point</text>
  <text start="858.259" dur="6.731">they&amp;#39;ve already pushed the plan forward</text>
  <text start="862.11" dur="7.32">and they&amp;#39;re going to wait for the right</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="8.159">moment and that moment is coming very</text>
  <text start="869.43" dur="6.63">very quickly I believe it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="873.149" dur="5.461">once Trump is elected president once</text>
  <text start="876.06" dur="4.92">again and he&amp;#39;s in for a second term I</text>
  <text start="878.61" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s gonna wait that long</text>
  <text start="880.98" dur="6.18">I think he&amp;#39;s gonna do it as quickly as</text>
  <text start="884.25" dur="5.339">possible and we&amp;#39;re gonna see everything</text>
  <text start="887.16" dur="3.659">change he has nothing to lose at this</text>
  <text start="889.589" dur="3.81">point he&amp;#39;s not really worried about</text>
  <text start="890.819" dur="5.341">another election and if he does it early</text>
  <text start="893.399" dur="6">enough and he allows the country to grow</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="6.9">as the country comes out of this</text>
  <text start="899.399" dur="6.481">transition people will see a very big</text>
  <text start="903.06" dur="4.139">difference and he needs the time to do</text>
  <text start="905.88" dur="3.42">this and this is why I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.199" dur="5.521">gonna wait that long once he&amp;#39;s elected</text>
