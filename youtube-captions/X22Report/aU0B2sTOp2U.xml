  <text start="121.069" dur="5.73">Baltimore to look at many other cities</text>

  <text start="158.659" dur="4.311">first let&amp;#39;s head out to Baltimore we</text>
  <text start="161.629" dur="5.211">know that Trump</text>

  <text start="194.8" dur="8.91">Trump&amp;#39;s tweet Baltimore is rat infested</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="7.47">perfect timing now Bryan Gates tweeted</text>
  <text start="203.71" dur="5.55">out the following aha</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="5.77">exactly like I figured a ton of federal</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="4.92">dollars went into Baltimore under Trump</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="5.22">in the last two and a half years 18</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="5.9">billion they tracked it they know what</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="5.34">was done with it they know who looted it</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="4.48">then he went on to say okay I misheard</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="4.71">it wasn&amp;#39;t 18 billion over two and a half</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="6.78">years the HUD director said it was 16</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="7.5">billion in 2018 alone the Fed government</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="8.01">pumped 16 billion dollars into Cummings</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="6.42">District in 2018 where in the world did</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="3.03">the money go</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.03">and when you look at this this is the</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="8.16">Dee&amp;#39;s worst nightmare come true</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="6.94">Trump is bringing attention to their</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="5.37">cities how their rundown how their</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="4.29">rat-infested how there&amp;#39;s corruption that</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;re people sleeping on the streets</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="6.21">in San Francisco and he&amp;#39;s doing this on</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="4.081">purpose because now what he&amp;#39;s doing just</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="3.71">like he did with Puerto Rico we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265" dur="6.72">giving billions and billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="8.14">to Baltimore where is all this money</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="6.54">going because it&amp;#39;s not going to help the</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="5.28">cities because look at the cities so the</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="7.26">obvious question is where is it all</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="9.59">going and Trump he is doing this all on</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="7.23">purpose this is part of the storm</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="5.45">because he needs to bring attention and</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="5.199">he needs people to ask questions</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="4.1">about all of this remember the</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="4.68">mainstream media is not going to do it</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="5.739">the other politicians aren&amp;#39;t going to do</text>
  <text start="302.629" dur="4.141">it everyone&amp;#39;s going to stay quiet they</text>
  <text start="305.419" dur="3.631">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about this</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="5.369">this is not something that you bring out</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="5.28">to the public because now you have to</text>
  <text start="312.139" dur="6.451">start to explain and then if there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="6.54">audit it gets even worse and as we know</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="4.02">Trump is put the squad front and center</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="4.5">to make them the face of the deep party</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="5.97">and it seems it is working people are</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="5.49">siding with Trump there&amp;#39;s a poll and it</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="5.97">says Speaker Nancy Pelosi has 28%</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="8.88">favorable opinion and a 46% unfavorable</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="7.709">opinion about the squad and Trump is</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="5.459">again calling attention he&amp;#39;s calling</text>
  <text start="342.259" dur="5.22">attention to all these individuals and</text>
  <text start="345.199" dur="3.411">it&amp;#39;s being done on purpose at all part</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="4.47">of the plan</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="6.279">now the deep state players they are now</text>
  <text start="351.949" dur="5.071">panicking Coates is gone they&amp;#39;re no more</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="4.801">blocks the investigations are wrapping</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="5.429">up the truth is about to reveal to the</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="6.96">public and the DS they really have</text>
  <text start="362.449" dur="7.981">nothing left everything that was in</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="7.979">place to protect them is slowly being</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="6.63">stripped away and before you know it end</text>
  <text start="374.629" dur="6.991">it&amp;#39;s getting to that point they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="6.779">have nothing and this is why you&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="381.62" dur="6.299">certain deep state player certain Dems</text>
  <text start="383.839" dur="7.561">come out and all they do is tweet scream</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="6.93">look at Debbie wasserman-schultz now she</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="5.91">has quite a bit to lose here she tweeted</text>
  <text start="394.849" dur="5.37">out the following a trail Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="5.609">your racist insults will never change</text>
  <text start="400.219" dur="5.94">the fact that at representative Cummings</text>
  <text start="402.919" dur="6.81">has unmatched integrity and universal</text>
  <text start="406.159" dur="6.841">bipartisan respect you are reviled he is</text>
  <text start="409.729" dur="5.16">revered at oversight Dems will continue</text>
  <text start="413" dur="5.509">to do our jobs and expose your</text>

  <text start="418.509" dur="6.621">she&amp;#39;s nervous she&amp;#39;s afraid she realizes</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="4.901">what is happening</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="6.84">and it looks like that entire DNC</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="7.62">lawsuit well it looks like a federal</text>
  <text start="431.97" dur="5.85">judge dismissed it with prejudice this</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="4.08">is the conclusion the court have</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="3.66">considered all the arguments raised by</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="3.66">the parties to the extent not</text>
  <text start="441.48" dur="4.53">specifically addressed the arguments are</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="4.62">either moot or without merit for the</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="4.86">reasons explained above the DNC&amp;#39;s second</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="5.1">amended complaint is dismissed with</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="5.19">prejudice and the campaign&amp;#39;s motion for</text>

  <text start="456.06" dur="3.66">clerk is directed to enter judgment</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="6.51">dismissing the second amendment to</text>
  <text start="459.72" dur="7.17">complain with prejudice now think about</text>
  <text start="464.07" dur="5.94">this everything is based on Russian</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="5.79">collusion everything that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="470.01" dur="5.19">talking about the DNC hacked WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.68">Clinton&amp;#39;s emails you name it it was all</text>
  <text start="475.2" dur="5.39">blamed on the Russians Russians were</text>

  <text start="480.59" dur="8.14">it&amp;#39;s all falling apart and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="8.01">know what to do they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="9.29">panicking and fear is setting in now</text>
  <text start="493.5" dur="10.23">very interestingly Chris Ray&amp;#39;s FBI</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="9.49">continues to cover for the FBI that</text>
  <text start="503.73" dur="7.1">dealt with commis Russian shenanigans</text>
  <text start="507.51" dur="6.089">and they will not release certain</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="5.11">information and this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="4.62">the hill the FBI can&amp;#39;t afford to</text>
  <text start="515.94" dur="3.779">jeopardize the fragile relationship that</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="3.301">exists between the United States and</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="3.45">certain foreign groups the FBI official</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="4.05">declared in another dramatic argument</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="4.641">against the conservative group citizens</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="4.92">united request to release the memos and</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="5.05">if that wasn&amp;#39;t enough the bureau</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="4.46">actually claimed that FBI special agents</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="5.34">have privacy interests from unnecessary</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="5.8">unofficial questioning as to the conduct</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="5.04">of investigations and other FBI business</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="4.68">in other words agents don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="5.61">to answer to the public but you know</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="7.25">since we pay their salaries when we want</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="6.32">answers to certain questions they should</text>
  <text start="552.68" dur="6.24">reply to them</text>
  <text start="555.17" dur="7.49">now we have to ask ourselves a couple of</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="8.3">questions here is Rey a sleeper agent</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="7.869">can Rey be trusted why isn&amp;#39;t the FBI</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="6.07">turning over this information well first</text>
  <text start="570.529" dur="5.61">of all let&amp;#39;s go back to post 1122 this</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="6.329">was this was August 10th 2018 it says</text>
  <text start="576.139" dur="7.021">trust sessions trust Rey trusts Kansas</text>
  <text start="579.619" dur="5.75">trust Horowitz trusts Huber so their cue</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="5.579">is telling us that we should trust Rey</text>
  <text start="585.369" dur="7.84">then and this was just yesterday post</text>
  <text start="588.739" dur="6.45">35:37 and anon said Rey is a sleeper</text>
  <text start="593.209" dur="7.74">because dan coates is a sleeper agent</text>
  <text start="595.189" dur="6.27">and Q says future marker now think about</text>
  <text start="600.949" dur="3.93">this</text>
  <text start="601.459" dur="5.511">why wouldn&amp;#39;t they hand over the memos</text>
  <text start="604.879" dur="5.43">right now now we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="6.429">because if they hand over the memos and</text>
  <text start="610.309" dur="5.97">newness and others get it Schiff and the</text>
  <text start="613.399" dur="7.59">rest would leak them out Plus this is</text>
  <text start="616.279" dur="10.321">part of an investigation this is an</text>
  <text start="620.989" dur="7.32">ongoing investigation by durham think</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="2.849">about that for a second and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="628.309" dur="4.89">be discussing that a little bit later</text>
  <text start="629.449" dur="6.87">because Whittaker actually brought this</text>
  <text start="633.199" dur="4.911">up I don&amp;#39;t know if he knew that he was</text>
  <text start="636.319" dur="6.12">saying this or it slipped</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="5.919">but Comey is being investigated and</text>
  <text start="642.439" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="644.029" dur="5.071">minute now what&amp;#39;s very interesting we</text>
  <text start="647.179" dur="3.99">know that the deep state the Dems they</text>
  <text start="649.1" dur="4.349">want to get Trump&amp;#39;s tax returns and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="651.169" dur="4.47">said this from the beginning this has</text>
  <text start="653.449" dur="5.94">all been planned out from the very</text>
  <text start="655.639" dur="6.091">beginning they knew if they withheld</text>
  <text start="659.389" dur="7.13">Trump&amp;#39;s tax returns they were going to</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="7.559">come after his returns in full force and</text>
  <text start="666.519" dur="6.97">I do believe they knew they were going</text>
  <text start="669.289" dur="7.8">to modify the laws New York has done it</text>
  <text start="673.489" dur="5.25">and now California has done it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="677.089" dur="6.56">called the presidential tax transparency</text>
  <text start="678.739" dur="8.22">accountability act this is SB 27 and</text>
  <text start="683.649" dur="5.531">Newsom signed it saying whoever is</text>
  <text start="686.959" dur="4.861">running for president must</text>
  <text start="689.18" dur="5.46">Douce their tax returns if they want to</text>
  <text start="691.82" dur="4.56">be on the ballot in California now of</text>
  <text start="694.64" dur="4.8">course Trump&amp;#39;s lawyer came out and said</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="5.88">hey we&amp;#39;re gonna take this to court this</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="4.49">is unconstitutional but I do believe</text>
  <text start="702.26" dur="4.2">that this is part of a bigger plan</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="4.69">because if we go back to Q&amp;#39;s post where</text>
  <text start="706.46" dur="4.59">it says what happens if all these</text>
  <text start="708.62" dur="5.01">individuals were audited one to two</text>
  <text start="711.05" dur="4.11">years and if you notice they keep</text>
  <text start="713.63" dur="3">screaming and yelling I want to see</text>
  <text start="715.16" dur="3.63">taxes I&amp;#39;m gonna see this I want to see</text>
  <text start="716.63" dur="5.04">their investments I want to dig deep</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="6.36">I believe the Patriots are setting them</text>
