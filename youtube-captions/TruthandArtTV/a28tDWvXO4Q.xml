  <text start="473.05" dur="6.04">J&amp;#39;Accuse at a million times trust</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="6.15">sessions we know that sessions is the</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="5.28">architect of a lot of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.28">in the storm he&amp;#39;s the one that appointed</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="4.26">Huber and all the stuff that&amp;#39;s all this</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="3.89">in spite all these investigations going</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="6.33">on with the Office of Inspector General</text>
  <text start="490.66" dur="6.069">behind the scenes his job the actor here</text>
  <text start="494.96" dur="6">was to play the role of the weak guy</text>
  <text start="496.729" dur="7.231">this my friends is the reason why on</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="4.98">this channel I had I started emphasizing</text>

  <text start="505.94" dur="6.99">thing Group a B C and D and emphasize to</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="5.82">people the difference between Group A</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="7.669">and Group B because Group B people that</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="7.92">consider themselves Patriots and follow</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="6.401">conservative news they attack Jeff</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.349">Sessions as weak and all that because</text>
  <text start="527" dur="3.66">they don&amp;#39;t follow the cue drums so they</text>
  <text start="529.459" dur="4.171">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="4.26">but look what is happening now see what</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="4.05">you think hopefully you still are</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="5.55">wearing your thinking cap quote he</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="4.74">Rosenstein chose the respected Bob</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="5.66">Mueller all in accordance with</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="6.21">procedures of the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="4.87">think about that sessions is saying that</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="4.98">session said doubling down on a decision</text>
  <text start="551" dur="4.91">to recuse himself from his jump sessions</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="4.95">then thanked Rosenstein for hijacking</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="4.63">the Justice Department the writer is</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="4.53">saying quote what I know</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="4.44">full-well rod is what you fully under is</text>
  <text start="563.09" dur="5.25">that you fully understood the nature of</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="6.8">your responsibilities as duty as deputy</text>
  <text start="568.34" dur="6.33">attorney general so think about it</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="5.65">sessions appointed Rosenstein and then</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="8.94">he&amp;#39;s telling you telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="577.43" dur="9.18">rod fully understood the nature of his</text>

  <text start="586.61" dur="4.05">told that he was gonna have to do</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="4.86">remember that cue said if Rosenstein is</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="4.95">dirty mueller&amp;#39;s dirty and mule is dirty</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="6.66">rose means dirty same thing and remember</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="8.15">that Muller met with Trump the day</text>
  <text start="599.57" dur="7.98">before he was appointed special counsel</text>
  <text start="603.76" dur="7.03">what does all of this mean and then</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="5.4">session says and we can nap and we can</text>
  <text start="610.79" dur="5.22">know full well also that you have</text>

  <text start="626.9" dur="6.27">wearing you&amp;#39;re still thinking cap this</text>
  <text start="629.69" dur="6.6">confirms 100% to me that Rosenstein the</text>
  <text start="633.17" dur="4.65">whole time was an actor as is Mueller it</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re not dirty if</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="5.7">one&amp;#39;s dirty the other one&amp;#39;s dirty but</text>

  <text start="651.68" dur="4.55">affirmed the rule of law and we know</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="5.55">that when it&amp;#39;s all said and done</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="6.07">Rosenstein agrees with the Mueller</text>
  <text start="659.81" dur="7.11">report and look at this headline coup</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="7.74">plotter Rosenstein takes a veiled shot</text>

  <text start="682.34" dur="3.48">should exercise caution whenever</text>
  <text start="684.17" dur="3.93">unpleasant circumstances</text>
  <text start="685.82" dur="6.66">tempt us to disregard timeless</text>
  <text start="688.1" dur="6.09">principles he said it is most important</text>

  <text start="713.389" dur="5.25">criticized Rosenstein if you think about</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="5.459">it and so I&amp;#39;ll let you do the thinking</text>
  <text start="718.639" dur="5.581">there they let I think here&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="721.639" dur="5.37">think went down is Rosenstein and</text>
  <text start="724.22" dur="5.34">Mueller and sessions and Trump and</text>
  <text start="727.009" dur="5.82">whoever else they got together and they</text>
  <text start="729.56" dur="5.19">created the scenario they&amp;#39;d had their</text>
  <text start="732.829" dur="3.601">roles knowing what the end result was</text>
  <text start="734.75" dur="4.68">gonna be they were gonna chase after the</text>
  <text start="736.43" dur="6.3">truth and this goes back to the whole</text>
  <text start="739.43" dur="5.82">thing with Rosen staying you know</text>
  <text start="742.73" dur="4.589">wearing a microphone and you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="745.25" dur="4.439">beginning to suspect that that was</text>
  <text start="747.319" dur="4.291">staged as well so they can get</text>
  <text start="749.689" dur="5.551">everything on records you know that by</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="6.18">him doing that and showing these other</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="4.74">players at the top of the FBI going</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="4.349">along with this and then it was</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="6.06">Rosenstein that suggested to Trump to</text>
  <text start="762.139" dur="5.82">fire Comey but we&amp;#39;ll see you know maybe</text>
  <text start="766.04" dur="3.45">the cute well the cute team will let us</text>
  <text start="767.959" dur="3.69">know what&amp;#39;s really going on behind him</text>
  <text start="769.49" dur="4.349">behind the scenes but I think that this</text>
  <text start="771.649" dur="4.17">is interesting that sessions officially</text>
  <text start="773.839" dur="4.98">comes out and says Thank You Rosa Steen</text>
  <text start="775.819" dur="5.851">well your honor Bowl and all that what</text>
  <text start="778.819" dur="5.971">the Patriots play this card if they</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="5.669">truly knew that Rosenstein was dirty</text>
  <text start="784.79" dur="4.049">from beginning to end and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.339" dur="3.3">had they didn&amp;#39;t cut a deal with this guy</text>
  <text start="788.839" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s what it tells me they cut a deal</text>
  <text start="790.639" dur="5.82">with this guy period and he&amp;#39;s played</text>
  <text start="793.519" dur="7.17">along with the Patriots and today to me</text>
  <text start="796.459" dur="7.171">this confirms the fact that sessions is</text>
  <text start="800.689" dur="5.281">talking this way so see what you think</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="5.04">on that topic let&amp;#39;s move on we have</text>
  <text start="805.97" dur="5.309">McConnell the case is closed and I</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="6.229">understand Trump&amp;#39;s frustration with Don</text>
  <text start="811.279" dur="8.011">jr. subpoena it will have a happy ending</text>
  <text start="814.899" dur="6.94">yeah why is McConnell saying this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.29" dur="5.01">just telling everybody I think the good</text>
  <text start="821.839" dur="5.31">news is the Chairman burrows already</text>
  <text start="824.3" dur="3.6">indicted has already indicated that the</text>
  <text start="827.149" dur="4.051">committee will</text>
  <text start="827.9" dur="5.43">find no collusion because that will be</text>
  <text start="831.2" dur="3.63">consistent with the Miller investigation</text>
  <text start="833.33" dur="2.45">I think this is going to have a happy</text>
  <text start="834.83" dur="3.75">ending</text>
  <text start="835.78" dur="6.49">yeah you think that McConnell would be</text>
  <text start="838.58" dur="6">upset after chairman Burke comes out</text>
  <text start="842.27" dur="3.99">doing this yesterday with this old Don</text>
  <text start="844.58" dur="4.22">junior subpoena but he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s oh</text>
  <text start="846.26" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t worry it will be a happy ending</text>
  <text start="848.8" dur="5.83">again this could be a move by the</text>
  <text start="851.12" dur="5.67">Patriots to bring jr. in you know maybe</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s some so we&amp;#39;re gonna keep track</text>
  <text start="856.79" dur="4.77">of this but it&amp;#39;s interesting how</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="5.97">McConnell is reacting tonight then we</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="7.23">have this Facebook co-founder calls for</text>
  <text start="864.2" dur="6.63">breakup of company yeah can you believe</text>
  <text start="868.79" dur="4.44">that the co-founder of Facebook is</text>

  <text start="1117.17" dur="8.34">we are people not a statement there it</text>
  <text start="1121.7" dur="5.99">is and you can see the images as we</text>
  <text start="1125.51" dur="5.79">scroll down right there of the students</text>
  <text start="1127.69" dur="6.7">walking out and this is about time that</text>
  <text start="1131.3" dur="7.62">this happens but this is again to</text>
  <text start="1134.39" dur="7.41">counter the logic of the left that not</text>
  <text start="1138.92" dur="4.74">only are they pushing for gun control so</text>
  <text start="1141.8" dur="3.72">that the next shooter shows up and</text>
  <text start="1143.66" dur="3.69">everything is gun free zone and everyone</text>
  <text start="1145.52" dur="5.49">has to die because no one&amp;#39;s there to to</text>
  <text start="1147.35" dur="5.88">stop the shooter but then with every one</text>
  <text start="1151.01" dur="4.65">of those shootings they push even more</text>
  <text start="1153.23" dur="5.04">of this agenda they don&amp;#39;t even give a</text>
  <text start="1155.66" dur="6.66">chance for the people to mourn properly</text>
  <text start="1158.27" dur="6.78">this is great that they did that and the</text>
  <text start="1162.32" dur="6.96">bottom line wrapping up is with this</text>
  <text start="1165.05" dur="6.36">that when there are good guys with guns</text>
  <text start="1169.28" dur="4.44">at these scenes because you never know</text>
  <text start="1171.41" dur="5.61">when it&amp;#39;s gonna happen but especially at</text>
  <text start="1173.72" dur="4.61">a school right there because of Governor</text>
  <text start="1177.02" dur="4.89">De Santis</text>
  <text start="1178.33" dur="5.8">the next shooter at a Florida school is</text>
  <text start="1181.91" dur="3.87">not going to be doing very well matter</text>
  <text start="1184.13" dur="4.25">of fact it probably won&amp;#39;t be any more</text>
  <text start="1185.78" dur="5.73">shootings in Florida for a long time</text>
  <text start="1188.38" dur="7.21">because of this one law right there that</text>
  <text start="1191.51" dur="6.27">is how you stop mass shooters let them</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="3.57">know go ahead bring your gun but know</text>
  <text start="1197.78" dur="3">that you&amp;#39;re gonna take a bullet to the</text>
  <text start="1199.16" dur="4.41">head because there&amp;#39;s gonna be a good guy</text>
  <text start="1200.78" dur="4.68">with a gun in that room and when the</text>
  <text start="1203.57" dur="4.53">good the shooter knows that they are</text>
  <text start="1205.46" dur="3.06">less likely to plan a shooting plain and</text>
  <text start="1208.1" dur="3.06">simple</text>
  <text start="1208.52" dur="3.63">that is the way it works in areas where</text>
  <text start="1211.16" dur="3.42">people have guns</text>
  <text start="1212.15" dur="4.47">the shooters don&amp;#39;t want to take a chance</text>
  <text start="1214.58" dur="3.6">they know they&amp;#39;re not gonna survive a</text>
  <text start="1216.62" dur="4.26">mass shooting they&amp;#39;re not the name gonna</text>
  <text start="1218.18" dur="4.59">bother doing it plain and simple one</text>
  <text start="1220.88" dur="4.11">plus one equals two right there thank</text>
  <text start="1222.77" dur="5.3">you governor De Santis congratulations</text>
