  <text start="384.19" dur="6.3">partial government shutdown in the world</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="4.86">is seeing how Chuck Schumer and the rest</text>

  <text start="423.22" dur="4.68">to the world and we&amp;#39;re gonna do that</text>

  <text start="789.529" dur="5.821">this video again that Q said how can the</text>
  <text start="792.35" dur="5.429">Left refute this so it&amp;#39;s just about a</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="5.73">minute minute minute and a half long so</text>
  <text start="797.779" dur="6.151">let us play that now real reform means</text>
  <text start="801.08" dur="4.35">stronger border security and we can</text>
  <text start="803.93" dur="3.54">build on the progress my</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="4.26">administration&amp;#39;s already made putting</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="4.98">more boots on the southern border than</text>
  <text start="809.69" dur="5.16">at any time in our history and reducing</text>
  <text start="812.45" dur="5.67">illegal crossings to their lowest levels</text>
  <text start="814.85" dur="5.94">in 40 years real reform means</text>
  <text start="818.12" dur="5.31">establishing a responsible pathway to</text>
  <text start="820.79" dur="5.4">earned citizenship a path that includes</text>
  <text start="823.43" dur="4.98">passing a background check paying taxes</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="4.41">and a meaningful penalty learning</text>
  <text start="828.41" dur="3.87">English and going to the back of the</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="5.4">line behind the folks trying to come</text>
  <text start="832.28" dur="5.309">here legally all Americans not only in</text>
  <text start="836" dur="3.15">the state&amp;#39;s most heavily affected but in</text>
  <text start="837.589" dur="4.021">every place in this country are rightly</text>
  <text start="839.15" dur="6.48">disturbed by the large numbers of</text>
  <text start="841.61" dur="6.51">illegal aliens entering our country that</text>
  <text start="845.63" dur="4.86">job stay home might otherwise be held by</text>
  <text start="848.12" dur="4.26">citizens or legal immigrants the public</text>
  <text start="850.49" dur="4.77">service they use impose burdens on our</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="4.62">taxpayers that&amp;#39;s why our administration</text>
  <text start="855.26" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s moved aggressively to secure our</text>
  <text start="857" dur="4.62">borders more by hiring a record number</text>
  <text start="859.31" dur="4.17">of new border guards by deporting twice</text>
  <text start="861.62" dur="5.07">as many criminal aliens as ever before</text>
  <text start="863.48" dur="5.19">by cracking down on illegal hiring by</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="4.59">borrowing welfare benefits to illegal</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="5.22">aliens in the budget I will present to</text>
  <text start="871.28" dur="4.26">you we will try to do more to speed the</text>
  <text start="873.89" dur="3.81">deportation of illegal aliens who are</text>
  <text start="875.54" dur="5.79">arrested for crimes it is wrong and</text>
  <text start="877.7" dur="5.28">ultimately self-defeating for a nation</text>
  <text start="881.33" dur="3.84">of immigrants to permit the kind of</text>
  <text start="882.98" dur="5.31">abuse of our immigration laws we have</text>
  <text start="885.17" dur="6.2">seen in recent years and we must do more</text>
  <text start="888.29" dur="5.46">to stop it just saying no to everything</text>
  <text start="891.37" dur="5.29">may be good short term politic</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="5.01">but it&amp;#39;s not leadership we were sent</text>
  <text start="896.66" dur="5.13">here to serve our citizens not our</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="5.31">ambition there it is again</text>
  <text start="901.79" dur="4.89">I want everyone to hear that again let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.07" dur="4.44">keep spreading that video and as you</text>
  <text start="906.68" dur="4.94">said how can the love repeat they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="908.51" dur="5.52">but they can try to block the views of</text>
  <text start="911.62" dur="5.32">people coming to truth in our TV YouTube</text>
  <text start="914.03" dur="6.42">YouTube channel that they can do but</text>
  <text start="916.94" dur="8.37">they cannot refute the message in that</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="7.47">video and that is the reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="925.31" dur="3.06">playing it again because I have no doubt</text>
  <text start="927.92" dur="2.7">about it</text>
  <text start="928.37" dur="6.18">they have suppressed the views on this</text>
  <text start="930.62" dur="6.69">channel for posting that video there it</text>
  <text start="934.55" dur="4.89">is and tonight there&amp;#39;s only one new drop</text>
  <text start="937.31" dur="4.62">and Q is saying today&amp;#39;s showing you</text>
  <text start="939.44" dur="4.86">another video another bombshell so first</text>
  <text start="941.93" dur="4.74">of all let&amp;#39;s just play that right now as</text>
  <text start="944.3" dur="5.01">well in fact that&amp;#39;s the real answer</text>
  <text start="946.67" dur="5.01">pretending that we can deport 11 million</text>
  <text start="949.31" dur="3.96">people or build a wall without spending</text>
  <text start="951.68" dur="8.7">tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer</text>
  <text start="953.27" dur="9.21">money is abetting what is really just</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="5.73">factually incorrect it&amp;#39;s not gonna work</text>
  <text start="962.48" dur="4.41">the bill before us will certainly do</text>
  <text start="966.11" dur="3.03">some good</text>
  <text start="966.89" dur="4.89">it will authorize some badly needed</text>
  <text start="969.14" dur="4.949">funding for better fences and better</text>
  <text start="971.78" dur="5.04">security along our borders and that</text>
  <text start="974.089" dur="5.391">should help send some of the tide of</text>
  <text start="976.82" dur="5.31">illegal immigration in this country</text>
  <text start="979.48" dur="5.32">Senator McConnell wanted me to negotiate</text>
  <text start="982.13" dur="4.02">the wall with President Trump I said to</text>
  <text start="984.8" dur="4.47">him two things first it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="986.15" dur="5.25">negotiation no wall and second I said</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="4.95">only you can persuade him that he</text>
  <text start="991.4" dur="5.64">shouldn&amp;#39;t do the wall because it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="994.22" dur="6.18">cause a government shutdown illegal</text>
  <text start="997.04" dur="6.21">immigration is wrong and a primary goal</text>
  <text start="1000.4" dur="5.99">of comprehensive immigration reform must</text>
  <text start="1003.25" dur="7.53">be to dramatically curtail future</text>
  <text start="1006.39" dur="6.55">illegal immigration second operational</text>
  <text start="1010.78" dur="4.05">control of our borders through</text>
