  <text start="487.03" dur="7.17">then we at bar says official explanation</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="5.31">for Trump surveillance isn&amp;#39;t adding up</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="5.25">yeah you think and he the bullet points</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="6.14">Attorney General William Bar set in a</text>
  <text start="499.45" dur="5.279">new interview that he has a basis for</text>
  <text start="503.22" dur="3.28">investigating the government</text>
  <text start="504.729" dur="4.411">surveillance against the Trump campaign</text>

  <text start="509.14" dur="5.43">please continue your investigation sir</text>
  <text start="511.93" dur="4.53">and then it says here in an interview</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="4.17">with CBS News Barr said that the</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="6.269">official explanation for surveillance of</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="7.14">the campaign is not jiving yeah thank</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="6.091">and Barr suggested that official claims</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="5.76">about the timeline of the investigations</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="7.89">are inconsistent to say the least right</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="7.38">with information he has seen during his</text>
  <text start="536.71" dur="6.56">short stint in office notice he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="8.13">talking about information he has seen as</text>
  <text start="543.27" dur="6.61">opposed to these hidden</text>
  <text start="547.15" dur="6.27">that Nadler is talk talking about they</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="7.26">don&amp;#39;t know the facts what facts sir West</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="6.15">we we know a lot of the information that</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="4.05">William Bar has seen because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="4.23">hearing and seeing the actual</text>
  <text start="561.19" dur="6.36">bulletproof bulletproof evidence for two</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="7.38">solid years two different stories being</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="7.26">told and two different two different</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="8.28">results will come about and again we see</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="7.14">where bars saying that the statements</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="6.03">about the original origins of the trunk</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="6.24">Russia investigation are just not jiving</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="6.6">with information he has learned during</text>
  <text start="588.19" dur="6.72">his short stint in office so Barr is</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="6.33">sounding very subtle he doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="5.73">come across too crazy and this is for</text>
  <text start="598.42" dur="6.18">optical reasons we know what he is</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="6.57">saying and he&amp;#39;s moving slow because he</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="5.34">knows how this is gonna unfold let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="5.1">keep going and then we have this this is</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="3.24">for all the trolls that had been</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="4.77">attacking humor</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="4.65">what is John Huber up to yeah good</text>
  <text start="617.08" dur="5.25">question</text>
  <text start="617.83" dur="7.25">William Barr finally tells us and we</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="5.79">know it says Huber the US Attorney in</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="6.79">Utah was appointed by bars predecessor</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="5.7">Jeff Sessions and we know this it says</text>
  <text start="631.87" dur="4.02">one focus of the probe was whether the</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="4.2">FBI misled the federal Surveillance</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="4.26">Court an application for spy warrants</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="4.41">against card page and then it says here</text>
  <text start="640.15" dur="5.96">but Huber was can has conducted his</text>
  <text start="642.43" dur="6.48">investigation largely out of public view</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="5.65">which opens up the door for trolls to</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="3.12">attack but we&amp;#39;re gonna get some answers</text>
  <text start="651.76" dur="2">tonight</text>
  <text start="652.03" dur="4.95">it says leading to widespread</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="6.13">speculation yeah like those speculation</text>
  <text start="656.98" dur="4.41">YouTube channels right there and all</text>
  <text start="659.89" dur="5.13">these people that like to speculate</text>
  <text start="661.39" dur="7.35">these commenters about what he was</text>
  <text start="665.02" dur="6.21">actually doing but these people that are</text>
  <text start="668.74" dur="4.71">speculating we the QR me we know what</text>
  <text start="671.23" dur="6.99">the common denominator is right they are</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="7.09">not part of group a see they don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="4.24">or believe in the q drops</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="3.84">so they won all that&amp;#39;s left when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.46" dur="3.81">not listening to the what Q the Q team</text>
  <text start="684.38" dur="5.16">is saying this is what is left</text>
  <text start="686.27" dur="4.95">speculation right there and then it goes</text>
  <text start="689.54" dur="3.93">on even members of Congress have</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="4.53">question what Huber was investigating or</text>
  <text start="693.47" dur="5.1">if he was leading an investigation at</text>
  <text start="695.75" dur="4.65">all and it goes on right House</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="3.96">Republicans sent Huber a letter we</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="3.99">talked about that last year and we have</text>
  <text start="702.53" dur="4.29">now Collins coming out saying your</text>
  <text start="704.39" dur="4.92">investigation has been ongoing for over</text>
  <text start="706.82" dur="3.81">nine months this was in the letter but</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="3.18">let&amp;#39;s get down to what is happening</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="3.54">because bar answered many of those</text>

  <text start="777.44" dur="5.37">it goes on said Barr who did not</text>
  <text start="780.26" dur="4.89">describe the Clinton probe and then he</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="3.63">said and says Huber was also initially</text>

  <text start="786.44" dur="5.85">warrant applications taken out against</text>
  <text start="789.29" dur="4.74">Paige a former Trump campaign adviser</text>

  <text start="795.95" dur="4.32">Court by relying on the unverified</text>

  <text start="821.09" dur="5.13">investigations are all wrapping up the</text>
  <text start="823.97" dur="3.6">truth is now coming out hopefully</text>
  <text start="826.22" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;ll silence people that have been</text>

  <text start="860.9" dur="6.03">part of the cavalry to the rescue and it</text>
  <text start="864.38" dur="6.63">goes on saying how the basically</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="7.86">journalism is dying and it goes on down</text>
  <text start="871.01" dur="7.05">here saying television news employment</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="5.31">has been basically flat but a Pew study</text>
  <text start="878.06" dur="4.98">indicates a declining percentage of</text>

  <text start="889.82" dur="6.59">fewer advertisers and what are we really</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="7.56">talking about it says multiple causes</text>
  <text start="896.41" dur="7.33">combined to explain the decline in</text>

  <text start="903.74" dur="7.89">the internet social media and digital</text>
  <text start="907.61" dur="8.1">sources is a factor especially when you</text>
  <text start="911.63" dur="7.11">have the Great Awakening and when cue</text>
  <text start="915.71" dur="5.61">has told us that we are now the news</text>
  <text start="918.74" dur="3.15">that is what you will not see in this</text>
  <text start="921.32" dur="3.51">article</text>
  <text start="921.89" dur="7.8">you better believe competition from the</text>
  <text start="924.83" dur="6.81">internet because people want truth and</text>
  <text start="929.69" dur="4.68">they don&amp;#39;t mention anything about that</text>
  <text start="931.64" dur="5.37">in this article but that is what this is</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="6.54">all about the systematic destruction of</text>
  <text start="937.01" dur="7.92">the old guard and qsa we are now the</text>
  <text start="940.91" dur="6.63">news that is the explanation for why</text>
  <text start="944.93" dur="4.01">people don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with</text>

  <text start="970.21" dur="6.66">where the Mexican president is basically</text>
