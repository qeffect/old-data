  <text start="149.66" dur="6.36">coming out of the gates and giving his</text>
  <text start="152.99" dur="4.71">little press conference to the world and</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re gonna break the press conference</text>
  <text start="157.7" dur="5.25">up into pieces we&amp;#39;re gonna break it up</text>
  <text start="160.43" dur="6.029">into four segments for the sake of ease</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="6.57">for an understanding and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="6.75">exactly what he said and why he might</text>
  <text start="169.52" dur="9.27">have said what he said so with all that</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="8.28">said let us begin by visiting revisiting</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="6.36">this article that I discussed a few</text>
  <text start="181.489" dur="5.521">nights ago on Sunday night when Lindsey</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="5.46">Graham was talking about Pelosi&amp;#39;s job</text>
  <text start="187.01" dur="6.72">very much at risk and let us revisit</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="6.599">what Lindsey Graham was saying not too</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="6.09">long ago Graham saying Nancy Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="6.151">riding a bucking wild Bronco called the</text>
  <text start="199.82" dur="6.48">Democratic caucus 70% of the Democratic</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="4.71">base once president Trump impeach she</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="8.189">knows that impeachment would be</text>
  <text start="208.07" dur="9">political suicide right there because</text>
  <text start="214.489" dur="5.341">there&amp;#39;s no reason to impeach the</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="5.43">president so she&amp;#39;s trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="219.83" dur="5.76">party in tact she goes down the</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="6.08">impeachment Road Republicans take back</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="7.47">the house we keep the Senate President</text>
  <text start="228.58" dur="9.159">Trump gets reelected we talked about</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="7.26">this on Sunday night how it goes on here</text>
  <text start="237.739" dur="5.431">right but her job is very much at risk</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="5.34">so what I think is going to happen here</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="5.58">I think that she&amp;#39;s going to be driven</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="5.88">towards if she goes down that road it</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="6.54">will be suicide for the Democratic Party</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="8.34">and if this is true ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="10.14">then today&amp;#39;s robert muller press</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="10.25">conference will make a lot of sense they</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="8.669">go for impeachment that is suicide</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="7.309">political suicide they don&amp;#39;t go for</text>
  <text start="274.099" dur="7.33">impeachment then</text>
  <text start="277.439" dur="8.04">that it&amp;#39;s not political suicide keep in</text>

  <text start="500.91" dur="6.15">it is important that you understand that</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="7.2">the written work speaks for itself so he</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="6.33">makes it real clear and he talks about</text>

  <text start="518.55" dur="7.5">going let me say a word about the report</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="5.71">the report has two parts addressing the</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="4.83">two main issues we were asked to</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="4.829">investigate the first volume of the</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="4.89">report details numerous efforts</text>
  <text start="532.529" dur="5.911">emanating from Russia to influence the</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="4.23">election this volume includes a</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.89">discussion of the Trump campaigns</text>
  <text start="540" dur="4.24">response to this activity as well as our</text>
  <text start="543.33" dur="3.039">conclusion</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="6.12">that there was insufficient evidence to</text>
  <text start="546.369" dur="6.63">charge a broader conspiracy and in the</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="5.699">second volume the report describes the</text>
  <text start="552.999" dur="5.491">results and analysis of our obstruction</text>
  <text start="556.059" dur="5.791">of justice investigation involving the</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="5.849">president the order appointing me</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="5.669">special counsel authorized us to</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="5.94">investigate actions that could obstruct</text>
  <text start="567.519" dur="4.951">the investigation and we conducted that</text>
  <text start="570.279" dur="5.011">investigation and we kept the office of</text>
  <text start="572.47" dur="6.059">the acting Attorney General apprised of</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="5.399">the progress of our work and as set</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="5.191">forth in the report after that</text>
  <text start="580.689" dur="4.95">investigation if we had had confidence</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="5.399">that the president clearly did not</text>
  <text start="585.639" dur="5.43">commit a crime we would have said so we</text>
  <text start="589.119" dur="3.81">did not however make a determination as</text>
  <text start="591.069" dur="5.041">to whether the President did commit a</text>
  <text start="592.929" dur="7.46">crime the introduction to the volume 2</text>
  <text start="596.11" dur="11.399">of our report explains that decision</text>
  <text start="600.389" dur="9.521">there it is if we had confidence that</text>
  <text start="607.509" dur="5.19">the president clearly did not commit a</text>
  <text start="609.91" dur="5.31">crime we would have said so oh and by</text>
  <text start="612.699" dur="5.55">the way we did not make a determination</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="6.149">as to whether the President did commit a</text>
  <text start="618.249" dur="6.45">crime it doesn&amp;#39;t get any more circle</text>
  <text start="621.369" dur="6.621">talk than that so at this point in the</text>
  <text start="624.699" dur="8.73">press conference we have the Dems</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="8.11">salivating their excitement Muller has</text>
  <text start="633.429" dur="4.41">given them something to be excited about</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="4.829">because remember all along all they want</text>
  <text start="637.839" dur="6.54">to do is get rid of Trump but they</text>
  <text start="640.929" dur="7.35">really don&amp;#39;t have anything see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.379" dur="6.661">playing the SIOP on them and if you</text>
  <text start="648.279" dur="5.821">don&amp;#39;t understand that then listening to</text>
  <text start="651.04" dur="5.899">what he said after that it explains that</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="5.459">under long-standing department policy a</text>
  <text start="656.939" dur="4.541">president president cannot be charged</text>
  <text start="659.559" dur="5.911">with a federal crime while he is in</text>
  <text start="661.48" dur="6.06">office that is unconstitutional even if</text>
  <text start="665.47" dur="6.229">the charge is kept under seal and hidden</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="6.959">from public view that too is prohibited</text>
  <text start="671.699" dur="4.291">the special counsels office is part of</text>
  <text start="674.499" dur="3.061">the Department of Justice and by</text>
  <text start="675.99" dur="4.53">regulation</text>
  <text start="677.56" dur="5.34">was bound by that department policy</text>
  <text start="680.52" dur="5.02">charging the president with a crime was</text>
  <text start="682.9" dur="6.33">therefore not an option we could</text>
  <text start="685.54" dur="5.91">consider the department&amp;#39;s written</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="5.4">opinion explaining the policy makes</text>
  <text start="691.45" dur="5.21">several important points that further</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="5.1">informed our handling of the obstruction</text>
  <text start="696.66" dur="4.99">investigation those points are</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="4.34">summarized in our report and I will</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="5.52">describe two of them for you</text>
  <text start="704.07" dur="5.8">first the opinion explicitly explicitly</text>
  <text start="707.17" dur="5.07">permits the investigation of a sitting</text>
  <text start="709.87" dur="3.99">president because it is important to</text>
  <text start="712.24" dur="5.789">preserve evidence while memories are</text>
  <text start="713.86" dur="6.06">fresh and documents available among</text>
  <text start="718.029" dur="4.471">other things that evidence could be used</text>
  <text start="719.92" dur="6.27">if there were co-conspirators who could</text>
  <text start="722.5" dur="5.91">be charged now and second the opinion</text>
  <text start="726.19" dur="4.92">says that the Constitution requires a</text>
  <text start="728.41" dur="6.179">process other than the criminal justice</text>
  <text start="731.11" dur="7.74">system to formally accuse a sitting</text>
  <text start="734.589" dur="7.651">president of wrongdoing there it is so</text>
  <text start="738.85" dur="6.57">if we had the confidence that the</text>
  <text start="742.24" dur="5.7">president clearly did not commit a crime</text>
  <text start="745.42" dur="5.04">and we would have told you and by the</text>
  <text start="747.94" dur="5.01">way we did not make a determination as</text>
  <text start="750.46" dur="4.35">to whether the President did commit a</text>
  <text start="752.95" dur="4.47">crime are you confused yet oh and by the</text>
  <text start="754.81" dur="5.88">way even if he did we wouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="757.42" dur="5.07">able to do anything and charging the</text>
  <text start="760.69" dur="4.89">president with a crime was therefore not</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="4.349">even an option but we did it but we went</text>
  <text start="765.58" dur="2.73">through this process anyway you know</text>
  <text start="766.839" dur="3.601">just in case we can get somebody else</text>
  <text start="768.31" dur="5.13">and that&amp;#39;ll be on record oh and by the</text>
  <text start="770.44" dur="5.19">way you know if you want to get him not</text>
  <text start="773.44" dur="4.26">that we have any reason to say that you</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="3.63">should but if you do want to get a man</text>
  <text start="777.7" dur="4.41">maybe you want to impeach him using</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="6.06">Congress but I didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="5.64">and then to wrap it up let&amp;#39;s play one</text>
  <text start="785.32" dur="5.16">more segment so beyond what I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="4.8">here today and what is contained in our</text>
  <text start="790.48" dur="3.81">written work I do not believe it is</text>
  <text start="792.55" dur="4.26">appropriate for me to speak further</text>

  <text start="835.81" dur="3.75">some crime we wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to</text>
  <text start="838" dur="3.6">do anything about it because the</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="5.01">Constitution doesn&amp;#39;t allow it but we did</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="5.16">this anyway oh and by the way you might</text>
