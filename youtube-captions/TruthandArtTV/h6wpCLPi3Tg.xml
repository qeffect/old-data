  <text start="265.83" dur="4.95">my friend that is why I said what I said</text>
  <text start="268.139" dur="9.711">in my opening statement that you have to</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="7.07">see the glass half-full and here is why</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="5.74">not only are you know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="5.82">pointing out in the conservative media</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="4.62">that and in the alternate and in the</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="5.04">mainstream media people are pointing out</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="8.13">that this is how the country was</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="7.44">designed Pelosi talking this way also</text>
  <text start="296.64" dur="5.64">tonight the country was originally</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="5.4">designed by the founding fathers to have</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="5.82">some representation at the government</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="7.23">level from each party that&amp;#39;s or some you</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="5.31">know but hey you know I want I want the</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="5.7">Republicans to run both side and we all</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="6.78">do but also I want to bring your</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="4.38">attention to this page particularly for</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="3.42">people that are not from the United</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="4.2">States maybe you don&amp;#39;t follow some of</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="4.98">this stuff and I&amp;#39;m not the greatest</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.49">political advisor as myself but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="6.42">take a look at the Senate and why this</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="8.04">is a big big deal tonight that the</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="6.81">Republicans locked the Senate it says</text>
  <text start="339.54" dur="4.8">this Senate here as the upper house the</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="5.19">Senate has several powers of advice</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="6.12">consent which are unique to it these</text>
  <text start="347.01" dur="5.22">include the approval of treaties and the</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="4.5">confirmation of cabinet secretaries</text>
  <text start="352.23" dur="6.18">Supreme Court justices federal judges</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="8.16">keep that in mind and other federal</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="8.4">executive officials flag officers think</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="6.03">military regulate regulatory officials</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="6.3">ambassadors and other federal uniformed</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="6.6">officers this is all controlled by the</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="4.59">Senate in addition to these in cases</text>
  <text start="375.75" dur="5.07">wherein no candidate receives a majority</text>
  <text start="377.7" dur="5.22">of electors or vice-president for</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="4.44">vice-president the Duty falls to the</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="5.16">Senate to elect one of the top two</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="5.73">recipients of electors for that office</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="7.02">it further has the responsibility of</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="6.04">conducting trials of those impeached by</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="6.49">the house</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="8.19">keep that in mind the Senate is widely</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="6.21">considered both a more deliberative and</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="4.46">more prestigious body than the House of</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.64">Representative due to its longer terms</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="6.16">smaller size and statewide</text>
  <text start="412.44" dur="5.8">constituencies which historically led to</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="6.33">a more collegial and less partisan</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="7.56">atmosphere so what I&amp;#39;m getting at is the</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="9.38">Senate has the stronghold when it comes</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="10.98">to the justice system think storm and</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="9.82">Supreme Court justices and flag officers</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="10.33">and the process of impeachment should</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="10.45">the lunatics on the Left should Skeletor</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="6.83">Pelosi and the lunatic left decide yeah</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="7.86">we&amp;#39;re gonna try an imprint impeach Trump</text>
  <text start="453.94" dur="7.03">please do and already the a lot of</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="3.63">people on Breitbart they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="6.87">saying that this is is just gonna</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="7.47">solidify Trump&amp;#39;s 2020 run Wednesday when</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="5.37">they see what the Dems are gonna be</text>
  <text start="470.78" dur="4.83">doing at the level of camino of con</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="5.01">their congressional level at the House</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="4.29">of Representative so there it is I just</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="6.5">want to throw that out there in terms of</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="7.65">the storm it is a big deal that the</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="5.14">Republicans seal that and you can see as</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="5.31">far as the overall effort Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="6.69">efforts were focused on the Senate the</text>
  <text start="492.86" dur="5.46">whole time you know he verbally told you</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t forget you know we gotta take the</text>
  <text start="498.32" dur="5.34">house also and all that red wave and all</text>
  <text start="500.57" dur="6">that but the Senate was the biggest deal</text>
  <text start="503.66" dur="6.24">and if you had to lose one of them I</text>
  <text start="506.57" dur="6.45">will take the deal I&amp;#39;ll take it</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="5.37">give me the Senate I&amp;#39;ll let you the</text>
  <text start="513.02" dur="4.95">little you know the Democrat lunatics</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;ll let them have the house</text>
  <text start="517.97" dur="5.22">because any impeachment that they try to</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="6.96">do has to go through the Senate think</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="7.59">Patriots translation the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="527.15" dur="5.49">complete control and you know Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.78" dur="5.1">agenda may you know they they may try</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="5.7">and slow it down but it&amp;#39;s not gonna be</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="5.37">enough I guarantee you people it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="5.52">gonna be enough and this lady knows it</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="4.47">and this is why I think she&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="4.08">saying well you know I might not be</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="3.6">around that long yeah because the</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="4.08">Patriots already probably had a talk</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="4.62">with her weeks ago they probably figured</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="4.08">that this was gonna happen who knows I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="4.17">not saying they did but there it is</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="4.05">tonight it&amp;#39;s not official yet but it</text>
