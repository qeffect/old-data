  <text start="493.07" dur="4.5">pulled and I had different views about</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="11.4">how we should proceed I&amp;#39;m never</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="9.84">surprised would say the same thing we</text>
  <text start="506.12" dur="3.06">work very closely with the president</text>

  <text start="524.63" dur="4.26">matter to American foreign policy</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="3.51">the one thing I would just say follow up</text>
