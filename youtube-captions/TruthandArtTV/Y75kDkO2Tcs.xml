  <text start="144.78" dur="4.02">Jordan the IG report makes one thing</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="3.989">clear and that is the hearing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.8" dur="3.99">gonna talk about today where the</text>
  <text start="150.599" dur="4.191">Patriots the Trump supporters all of us</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="3.5">we are vindicated today</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="3.72">and the deep state and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="5.1">media they&amp;#39;re nervous but why is that</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="7.02">happening and that brings us to very a</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="6.469">very important point and ironically The</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="7.829">Associated Press here in this article</text>
  <text start="167.859" dur="8.891">sort of summarizes as good as anyone</text>
  <text start="173.359" dur="5.88">tonight sort of you know we don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="4.68">it the only reason I&amp;#39;m saying that is</text>
  <text start="179.239" dur="4.08">because these writers here for this</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="4.35">associate Associated Press article with</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="6.09">Eric Tucker Michael Balsamo they are</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="7.379">nervous and they took a big hit today</text>
  <text start="189.409" dur="4.89">and that is because the first point man</text>
  <text start="193.159" dur="4.321">we&amp;#39;re going to get into this more on</text>
  <text start="194.299" dur="6.66">Friday live stream but the first point I</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="6.03">want to make tonight is that yeah this</text>
  <text start="200.959" dur="4.021">guy right here we have reason to believe</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="2.58">you know cue said a million times right</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="3.839">trust the plan</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="5.84">we are watching a movie right and if you</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="9.801">listen carefully to what happened today</text>
  <text start="211.93" dur="11.19">we&amp;#39;re gonna see that Horowitz cleverly</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="8.109">delivered two completely different</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="6.119">answers depending on who&amp;#39;s asking the</text>
  <text start="226.729" dur="2.51">question</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="7.44">and Q said we are watching a movie so me</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="6.99">here at roots energy b/c I am already</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="5.88">seeing what&amp;#39;s happening so before we go</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="4.14">any further let&amp;#39;s just see what the</text>
  <text start="243.49" dur="4.68">Associated Press the same watchdog</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="5.01">caught in political crossfire on his</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="4.95">Russia reports yeah what could that be</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="3.9">all about and it says here the Justice</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="3.56">Department&amp;#39;s internal watchdog was</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="4.589">caught in a political tug-of-war</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="5.11">Wednesday as Republican and Democrat</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="4.081">senators use his report on the origins</text>
  <text start="261.79" dur="3.99">of the Russia investigation involving</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="5.28">Donald Trump 2016 campaign to support</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="6.69">their views that it was a legitimate</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="7.86">probe or a badly bungled farce</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="6.72">so you see AP has now has to deal with</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="6.63">this new reality that Horowitz is</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="6.71">delivering basically to two stories two</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="7.05">narratives that are 180 degrees apart</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="7.75">and the Q Army says we are watching a</text>
  <text start="290.32" dur="5.31">movie and it goes on in this early part</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="4.11">of the paragraph of this whole article</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re telling you yeah is it talking</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="4.17">about how you know the Democrats point</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="3.57">of view and as it goes on it says but</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s like it says he is still in his</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="5.94">opening was overwhelming critical of the</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="4.8">investigation and he returns time and</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="4.29">again throughout the hearing to serious</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="4.2">problems that he said underscore the</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="4.83">need for policy changes and it goes on</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="5.13">and it gets worse just like yesterday as</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="6.479">this article goes on it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="321.64" dur="5.85">worse and worse and the AP is forced to</text>
  <text start="325.419" dur="5.071">cover this yeah we don&amp;#39;t know which ones</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="7.29">real now Horowitz is sounding like two</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="7.91">different people and to hear this for</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="6.139">yourself we begin here it says here</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="5.019">inspector general Horowitz refused</text>
  <text start="340.919" dur="5.951">attorney general barb bill Barr says</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="6.391">there was no spying on Trump campaign no</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="6.78">quote confidential source placed inside</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="7.53">Trump campaign now listen in to this</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="8.01">exchange to begin with between Feinstein</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="6.51">and Horowitz but listen carefully to how</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="5.07">Horowitz is answering her question</text>
  <text start="363.85" dur="5.04">when he should be saying yes no he</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="4.92">deflects the answer and says yeah well</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s my report says this he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="4.89">really answer her questions very</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="4.71">directly while at the same time making</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="4.56">her feel that he is supporting the</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="5.55">Democrat point of view listen it and you</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="6.99">didn&amp;#39;t find a deep state conspiracy</text>
  <text start="383.92" dur="7.41">against candidate or President Trump as</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="4.86">to the opening we found no no bias no</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="5.01">testimony on documentary events on that</text>
  <text start="392.95" dur="6.9">and no rationale for a deep state that</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="5.25">we looked at mr. pre-snap as I noted</text>
  <text start="399.85" dur="3.87">what mitt was the decision-maker and we</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="5.58">did not find any evidence in his emails</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="7.74">or texts of having engaged in any bias</text>
  <text start="407.17" dur="6.69">or having any bias FBI director ray</text>

  <text start="419.5" dur="5.3">there was quote and authorized purpose</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="6.36">and actual factual predication for the</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="5.35">investigation by contrast attorney</text>
  <text start="428.05" dur="4.59">general Barr expressed his doubt about</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="5.88">the legitimacy of the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.64" dur="5.79">investigation in press statements did</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="5.1">attorney general Barr provide any</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="6.3">evidence that caused you to alter this</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="7.08">key finding that the FBI investigation</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="6.84">had an adequate predicate I know we</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="5.58">stand by our finding thank you during</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="5.55">your investigation attorney general Barr</text>
  <text start="453.79" dur="5.97">stated his belief that quote spying on</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="5.31">the Trump campaign did occur and quote</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="5.79">and as you said your investigation found</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="5.25">no evidence that the FBI placed any</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="4.74">confidential source within the Trump</text>
  <text start="467.68" dur="5.1">campaign or tasked any confidential</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="5.1">source to report on the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s correct vibrant and further no</text>
  <text start="475.39" dur="5.64">evidence that political bias or improper</text>
  <text start="478.15" dur="6.15">motivations influenced the decision to</text>
  <text start="481.03" dur="4.98">use confidential sources as part of the</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="4.74">investigation that&amp;#39;s correct</text>

  <text start="528.649" dur="4.591">answer is we found no bias that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="4.14">what she asked you and you can see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="5.339">dodging around her questions basically</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="5.88">playing games with her making her feel</text>
  <text start="538.579" dur="4.68">yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna make you feel like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="3.829">going along with the Democrat talking</text>
  <text start="543.259" dur="5.281">point and he says none of the</text>
  <text start="545.319" dur="4.541">discussions changed our findings that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="3.57">not what she asked you so again</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="4.74">hopefully you guys kind of read into</text>
  <text start="552.11" dur="5.039">that he&amp;#39;s being vague but enough for the</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="6.359">headlines but while that was happening</text>
  <text start="557.149" dur="5.761">then we have this the same person it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.959" dur="5.101">like dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde is now he puts</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="6.02">on a completely different character like</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="6.69">a to personalities and like the other</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="7.599">Michael Horowitz now steps in today same</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="6.12">day yeah quote it&amp;#39;s pretty bad Michael</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="4.98">Horowitz sums up the FBI&amp;#39;s surveillance</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="5.159">abuses against Trump eight yeah</text>
  <text start="581.509" dur="6.601">completely different tune and like it</text>
  <text start="584.029" dur="5.761">says here he says it&amp;#39;s pretty bad and it</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="3.209">says Horowitz offered the assessment</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="3.57">during an exchange with Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="591.319" dur="4.531">the chairman of Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="4.409">Committee Graham laid out Horowitz his</text>
  <text start="595.85" dur="3.989">findings that a major source of for</text>
  <text start="597.769" dur="4.111">Christopher Steele had disavowed most of</text>
  <text start="599.839" dur="4.62">the former British spies infamous</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="5.1">dossier the FBI cited steals information</text>
  <text start="604.459" dur="4.38">to assert Carter Paige was a Russian</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="4.44">agent and he says here how would you</text>
  <text start="608.839" dur="4.86">describe the behavior here of knowing</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="4.38">that the sub source disavows the dossier</text>
  <text start="613.699" dur="4.56">that was the primary reason for a</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="4.469">warrant finding that a lawyer doctor an</text>
  <text start="618.259" dur="5.041">email to keep the investigation going in</text>
  <text start="620.269" dur="5.911">a way unfair to mr. Paige he says this</text>
  <text start="623.3" dur="5.49">was not routine do you agree with that</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="4.68">he says definitely not it certainly</text>
  <text start="628.79" dur="4.35">better not be routine and</text>
  <text start="630.86" dur="6.18">I don&amp;#39;t I think it says should be no of</text>
  <text start="633.14" dur="8.46">any reason to think it is routine it is</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="8.97">kind of off the charts that it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="7.44">bad says Horowitz so we see a different</text>
  <text start="646.01" dur="5.79">Horowitz and it goes on IG shuts down</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="3.36">James Comey no one is vindicated by my</text>
  <text start="651.8" dur="4.2">report</text>
  <text start="652.4" dur="4.17">so Horowitz is morphing into someone</text>
  <text start="656" dur="2.73">else</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="3.03">he says here I think the activities we</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="4.71">found here</text>
  <text start="659.6" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t vindicate anybody who touch this</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="3.9">finds it this is what The Associated</text>
  <text start="664.76" dur="5.04">Press is saying they are concerned like</text>
  <text start="667.34" dur="5.1">wait a minute he&amp;#39;s saying two opposite</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="6.27">things what&amp;#39;s happening here welcome to</text>
  <text start="672.44" dur="5.88">the storm fake news media and it says</text>
  <text start="676.07" dur="3.99">here Horowitz testified before the</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="4.41">Senate Judiciary Committee answering a</text>
  <text start="680.06" dur="6.51">question on whether Comey was vindicated</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="5.64">by the report and it goes on today this</text>

  <text start="697.13" dur="6.69">some of what Ted Cruz is saying today</text>
  <text start="701.06" dur="4.32">listen it you can open an investigation</text>
  <text start="703.82" dur="2.7">I say this as a former law enforcement</text>
  <text start="705.38" dur="2.52">official myself you can open an</text>
  <text start="706.52" dur="3.42">investigation pretty easily you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="707.9" dur="3.72">testified today that it can be done</text>
  <text start="709.94" dur="4.71">quite easily but when you actually start</text>
  <text start="711.62" dur="4.44">taking action start taking steps start</text>
  <text start="714.65" dur="4.29">gathering evidence start surveilling</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="4.89">Americans that&amp;#39;s when actually real</text>
  <text start="718.94" dur="4.47">questions arise in your testimony today</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="4.83">has been and in this report is that when</text>
  <text start="723.41" dur="4.35">that happened you&amp;#39;re there&amp;#39;s potential</text>
  <text start="725.78" dur="2.58">concerns here about political bias is</text>
  <text start="727.76" dur="3.45">that correct</text>
  <text start="728.36" dur="4.44">we have actions taken here that were not</text>

  <text start="732.8" dur="5.39">the policies and what we couldn&amp;#39;t reach</text>
  <text start="734.51" dur="3.68">a conclusion on is what motivated that</text>
  <text start="744.31" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="3.36">I think that&amp;#39;s very significant I mean</text>
  <text start="749.28" dur="3.12">here&amp;#39;s let me see on so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="4.5">question I&amp;#39;m struggling with which is</text>
  <text start="752.4" dur="5.04">worse is it worse to have a foreign</text>
  <text start="755.34" dur="4.41">government trying to meddle in our</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="4.25">elections or is it worse to have our own</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="4.47">government meddling in the election</text>
  <text start="761.69" dur="4.44">because that&amp;#39;s I think exactly what this</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="4.53">report shows it shows that our</text>
  <text start="766.13" dur="4.39">government the most powerful</text>
  <text start="768.75" dur="4.28">law-enforcement agency in the nation the</text>
  <text start="770.52" dur="6.69">FBI effectively meddled in an ongoing</text>
  <text start="773.03" dur="6.64">presidential campaign the DNC pays for</text>
  <text start="777.21" dur="4.89">the steal dossier solicits the steal</text>
  <text start="779.67" dur="5.54">dossier and then gets the Federal Bureau</text>

  <text start="785.21" dur="6.61">surveil and American citizen surveil a</text>

  <text start="791.82" dur="3.75">of this manufactured garbage that they</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="4.65">pay for I mean that&amp;#39;s extraordinary</text>
  <text start="795.57" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s that has got to be a first time</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="4.5">in history in fact let me just ask you</text>
  <text start="799.77" dur="6">so Horwitz are you aware ever of another</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="5.31">presidential campaign being targeted by</text>
  <text start="805.77" dur="4.11">the FDA FBI during the campaign like the</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="3.33">Trump one was to your knowledge does</text>
  <text start="809.88" dur="3.15">this Abraham I not but I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="811.38" dur="6.33">suggest I&amp;#39;m an expert on but to your</text>
  <text start="813.03" dur="6.42">knowledge that no yes so and I&amp;#39;m correct</text>
  <text start="817.71" dur="4.38">in thinking that the steel dossier the</text>
  <text start="819.45" dur="4.2">fusion GPSS he was solicited by and paid</text>
  <text start="822.09" dur="4.08">for the DNC I mean that that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="4.8">they said well the Clinton campaign or</text>
  <text start="826.17" dur="4.74">the DNC it was ultimately learned by the</text>
  <text start="828.45" dur="5.07">FBI that was the case where that came to</text>
  <text start="830.91" dur="5.64">be their belief and then so so we get</text>
  <text start="833.52" dur="5.94">the steal dossier it&amp;#39;s fed to the FBI</text>
  <text start="836.55" dur="4.89">the FBI goes and asked for these FISA</text>
  <text start="839.46" dur="4.17">warrants which have all of the problems</text>
  <text start="841.44" dur="3.99">that you have articulated and that my</text>
  <text start="843.63" dur="3.66">colleagues have drawn out including</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="3.93">sometimes outright fabrication of</text>
  <text start="847.29" dur="5.01">evidence in these FISA applications and</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="5.31">then not only does the FBI get a</text>
  <text start="852.3" dur="4.35">surveillance program ongoing effectively</text>
  <text start="854.67" dur="6.39">of a presidential campaign during cycle</text>
  <text start="856.65" dur="6.69">but they also get the DNC also gets news</text>
  <text start="861.06" dur="4.83">stories written during the campaign</text>
  <text start="863.34" dur="5.94">about the surveillance program in</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="4.68">September of 2016 there&amp;#39;s a story about</text>
  <text start="869.28" dur="3.24">possible counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="870.57" dur="5.25">investigation of the Trump campaign in</text>
  <text start="872.52" dur="5.49">October of 2016 there&amp;#39;s a story about</text>
  <text start="875.82" dur="4.8">the FBI investigating the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="878.01" dur="3.6">and we know on that last one that that</text>
  <text start="880.62" dur="3.12">Steele himself was in</text>
  <text start="881.61" dur="3.99">is that correct and also correct and the</text>
  <text start="883.74" dur="3.57">FBI actually ultimately knew that he was</text>
  <text start="885.6" dur="3.51">involved in the September 1 as well that</text>
  <text start="887.31" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;re referencing I believe a lawyer at</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="6.3">the FBI creates fraudulent evidence</text>
  <text start="891.78" dur="5.94">alters an email that is in turn used as</text>
  <text start="895.41" dur="5.37">the basis for a sworn statement to the</text>
  <text start="897.72" dur="5.61">court that the court relies on am i</text>
  <text start="900.78" dur="4.41">stating that accurately that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="903.33" dur="5.58">that is what occurred now you have</text>
  <text start="905.19" dur="6.45">worked in law enforcement a long time is</text>
  <text start="908.91" dur="5.4">the pattern of a Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="911.64" dur="4.38">employee altering evidence and</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="3.54">submitting fraudulent evidence that</text>
  <text start="916.02" dur="4.71">ultimately gets submitted to a court it</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="6.09">is that commonplace is that typical I</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="7.98">have not seen an alteration of an email</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="6.75">and impacting a court document like this</text>
  <text start="928.71" dur="4.29">there you have it folks a different</text>
  <text start="930.69" dur="5.52">Michael Horowitz answering you know</text>
  <text start="933" dur="4.77">agreeing with these senators yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="936.21" dur="3.15">they included the steel dusty and these</text>
  <text start="937.77" dur="3.12">other reports let me help you yeah it</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="2.21">was that Matt you can see it with your</text>
  <text start="940.89" dur="2.73">own two eyes</text>
  <text start="941.57" dur="3.67">different Michael Horowitz what is</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="5.4">happening should be asking yourself and</text>
  <text start="945.24" dur="6.03">then you have Richard Blumenthal like it</text>
  <text start="949.02" dur="4.53">says here Danang dick Blumenthal tries</text>
  <text start="951.27" dur="4.95">to justify car to page visor warrants</text>
  <text start="953.55" dur="5.61">based on bogus dossier what I like about</text>
  <text start="956.22" dur="5.52">this video highlight is that Blumenthal</text>
  <text start="959.16" dur="5.85">thinks yeah maybe I&amp;#39;ll get some nice</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="7.62">little juicy answers like Feinstein did</text>
  <text start="965.01" dur="6.81">listen in as Blumenthal tries to lure</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="4.5">Horowitz into giving him the sweet</text>
  <text start="971.82" dur="4.14">little answer that he won and look what</text>
  <text start="973.86" dur="4.89">Horowitz says to him those fights the</text>
  <text start="975.96" dur="6.15">warrants they were renewed a number of</text>
  <text start="978.75" dur="6.33">times correct three times based on your</text>
  <text start="982.11" dur="6.72">experience and maybe your report there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.08" dur="5.58">a reason why warrants are renewed their</text>
  <text start="988.83" dur="3.93">renewed because they are producing</text>
  <text start="990.66" dur="3.81">useful information correct or they</text>
  <text start="992.76" dur="4.14">should be producing useful information</text>
  <text start="994.47" dur="4.35">they should tell appraiser and your</text>
  <text start="996.9" dur="4.47">review of those warrants would indicate</text>
  <text start="998.82" dur="5.66">that they were producing useful</text>
  <text start="1001.37" dur="3.11">information correct</text>
  <text start="1009.56" dur="4.41">not sure that&amp;#39;s entirely correct and I</text>
  <text start="1012.23" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t know how much I can say about that</text>
  <text start="1013.97" dur="4.38">in this setting well they were producing</text>
  <text start="1015.98" dur="3.96">information they were producing</text>
  <text start="1018.35" dur="3.09">information I&amp;#39;m not sure how I would</text>
  <text start="1019.94" dur="7.55">characterize whether they were helpful</text>
  <text start="1021.44" dur="9.09">or not right there nice try Blumenthal</text>
  <text start="1027.49" dur="5.86">there&amp;#39;s a reason why warrants are</text>
  <text start="1030.53" dur="3.9">renewed yeah Norma and I like the way</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="3.33">Horowitz says yeah</text>
  <text start="1034.43" dur="4.259">in the way they should be when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1036.68" dur="4.08">collecting you know and then he says not</text>
  <text start="1038.689" dur="5.311">sure that&amp;#39;s exactly correct he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1040.76" dur="4.8">to put words in Horowitz&amp;#39;s mouth but</text>
  <text start="1044" dur="4.47">Horowitz does not go for it could see</text>
  <text start="1045.56" dur="5.43">this is the other Horowitz the Horowitz</text>
  <text start="1048.47" dur="4.92">2.0 not the 1.0 that we saw at the</text>
  <text start="1050.99" dur="5.37">beginning with Feinstein right there you</text>
