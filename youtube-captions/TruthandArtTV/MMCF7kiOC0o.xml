  <text start="133.68" dur="5.07">week right we have these two stories</text>
  <text start="136.319" dur="6.361">that are being told the left the</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="7.069">Democrats they are pushing this illusion</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="4.669">that we are supposed to talk about</text>
  <text start="145.819" dur="3.661">this you know Trump has committed some</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="5.581">sort of crime nobody knows what crime it</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="6.36">was but you know he&amp;#39;s he needs to be</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="5.58">impeached and this is serious and the</text>

  <text start="160.4" dur="4.89">interview anybody they&amp;#39;ll tell you well</text>
  <text start="162.769" dur="5.521">of struction we think obstruction of</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="4.529">what there you go check me so they have</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="4.41">no idea what they&amp;#39;re talking about while</text>
  <text start="169.819" dur="5.881">the Patriots are marching forward with</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="5.159">this unbelievable mountain of evidence</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="4.92">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see tonight that they</text>
  <text start="177.859" dur="5.88">are playing the left tonight we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="7.5">see a whole new level for you to</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="5.7">consider how the Patriots are making</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="2.39">power moves like we talked about</text>
  <text start="189.439" dur="4.711">yesterday</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="6.28">setting up the left as you see that</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="5.22">there are no new cue drops tonight they</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="6.839">are setting up the left for failure and</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="9.179">I have to believe this is all part of</text>
  <text start="203.629" dur="7.771">the plan let&amp;#39;s break this down as we</text>
  <text start="208.549" dur="5.58">move forward tonight first of all I want</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="6.959">to point everyone to you know we know</text>
  <text start="214.129" dur="6.39">that the left has been making a big big</text>
  <text start="218.359" dur="5.16">stink out of this simple comment that</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="5.851">the president made about that he would</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="4.62">listen to opposition research you know</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="3.869">some somebody came to him with</text>
  <text start="228.139" dur="4.52">information from one of his opposition</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="6.15">that he would at least listen to it and</text>
  <text start="232.659" dur="7.72">we&amp;#39;re gonna see tonight that this entire</text>
  <text start="236.389" dur="5.43">narrative maybe the biggest trap let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.379" dur="4.92">see what President Trump is saying about</text>
  <text start="241.819" dur="5.84">some of this stuff we see here Trump is</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="4.8">saying unrelated to Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="247.659" dur="4.95">although the radical left doesn&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="250.099" dur="5.371">the name Russia anymore since the issue</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="6.071">issuance of the malla report house them</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="6.18">House Committee now plays they seldom</text>
  <text start="258.68" dur="4.919">use contempt card on our great Attorney</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="6.239">General and Secretary of Commerce this</text>
  <text start="263.599" dur="6.69">time on the census Dems play much</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="4.261">tougher game than the Republicans did</text>
  <text start="270.289" dur="4.591">when they had the House Majority and</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="7.979">then Trump says Republicans will</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="8.939">remember yeah they are gonna remember</text>
  <text start="280.129" dur="7.29">and then just looking around here Trump</text>
  <text start="283.819" dur="6.6">is quoting Alan Dershowitz Congress</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="5.941">cannot impeach President Trump did</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="4.95">nothing wrong because they because if</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="3.899">they did they would be putting</text>
  <text start="295.369" dur="3.81">themselves above the law the</text>
  <text start="297.259" dur="4.77">Constitution provides criteria for</text>
  <text start="299.179" dur="4.86">impeachment treason bribery high crimes</text>
  <text start="302.029" dur="4.92">and misdemeanors there it is</text>
  <text start="304.039" dur="4.91">and he says unless there is compelling</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="4.23">evidence impeachment is not</text>
  <text start="308.949" dur="4.87">constitutionally constitutionally</text>
  <text start="311.179" dur="5.401">permissible but the left knows that</text>
  <text start="313.819" dur="4.47">their followers they not only don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="3.119">about the Constitution they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.289" dur="2.66">understand it they don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="3.48">what&amp;#39;s in it</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="4.36">plain and simple everybody knows that</text>
  <text start="323.179" dur="5.061">they have no idea what it what&amp;#39;s in it</text>
  <text start="325.309" dur="5.91">they completely disconnected from it</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="5.589">let&amp;#39;s keep looking around what else</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="5.07">Trump is saying yeah look right here</text>
  <text start="333.829" dur="4.41">Trump says I meet and talk with to</text>
  <text start="336.289" dur="4.25">foreign governors governments every day</text>
  <text start="338.239" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m I just met with the Queen of England</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="5.321">the Prince of Wales the Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="343.099" dur="5.16">in the United Kingdom and the PM of</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="4.349">Ireland the president of France and the</text>
  <text start="348.259" dur="5.07">president of Poland we talked about</text>
  <text start="350.209" dur="6.47">everything should I immediately call the</text>
  <text start="353.329" dur="4.62">FBI about these calls and meetings how</text>
  <text start="356.679" dur="4">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="357.949" dur="5.67">yeah the full context of what Trump</text>
  <text start="360.679" dur="5.871">meant when he said what he said and then</text>
  <text start="363.619" dur="7.2">he says I would never be trusted again</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="6.759">with that being said my full answer is</text>
  <text start="370.819" dur="4.65">rarely played by the fake news media</text>
  <text start="373.309" dur="6.78">they purposely leave out the part that</text>
  <text start="375.469" dur="6.87">matters so keep that in mind as we skip</text>
  <text start="380.089" dur="6.39">around we&amp;#39;re gonna come back to this</text>

  <text start="1232.55" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re following those procedures but I</text>
  <text start="1234.23" dur="4.62">think we need to strengthen not just the</text>
  <text start="1237.05" dur="4.08">the typical way of doing things but put</text>
  <text start="1238.85" dur="4.32">it in law so that they are required to</text>
  <text start="1241.13" dur="5.49">brief us mr. lonegan I would only say</text>

  <text start="1271.25" dur="4.47">and follow the facts and and just look</text>
  <text start="1274.07" dur="3.51">at his direct testimony to this</text>
