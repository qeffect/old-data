  <text start="558.809" dur="5.76">found that a lot of answers have been</text>
  <text start="561.589" dur="6.52">inadequate and I&amp;#39;ve also found that some</text>
  <text start="564.569" dur="9.69">of the explanations I&amp;#39;ve gotten don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.109" dur="9.81">hang together ya think Barr is being</text>
  <text start="574.259" dur="8.04">very subtle and he&amp;#39;s going along with</text>
  <text start="577.919" dur="7.73">this plan and I just wanted to put that</text>
  <text start="582.299" dur="8.15">out there he&amp;#39;s being very subtle saying</text>

  <text start="619.169" dur="5.97">considering flights to Detroit Miami</text>
  <text start="621.869" dur="5.46">Buffalo New and Buffalo New York the</text>
  <text start="625.139" dur="3.961">flights are the latest signs of how the</text>
  <text start="627.329" dur="4.32">Border Patrol is struggling to keep up</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="4.229">with large numbers of Central American</text>
  <text start="631.649" dur="5.79">families that are reaching the US border</text>
