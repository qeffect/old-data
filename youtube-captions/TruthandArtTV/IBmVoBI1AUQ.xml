  <text start="150.38" dur="7.38">the news nowadays you have the left</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="8.02">continuing to attack president Donald J</text>

  <text start="164.93" dur="6.75">see as we talked about yesterday that</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="7.38">the Patriots have set the left up the</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="6.86">Dems have been set up to now they are on</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="9.06">public record they&amp;#39;re on record</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="7.27">acknowledging that colluding with a</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="3.26">foreign government which is what they</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="3.96">did</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="5.71">we&amp;#39;re gonna see tonight that some of</text>
  <text start="189.77" dur="5.91">them are saying full-on treason and the</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="5.61">Patriots must be smiling behind the</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="7.14">scenes like thank you for telling us</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="7.47">that that is what that is that is the</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="5.34">extent to which the Patriots are playing</text>
  <text start="206" dur="5.88">around with the left we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="208.16" dur="6.36">continuation of that tonight and grant</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="5.13">some popcorn my friends and let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="214.52" dur="4.08">again let&amp;#39;s see what we have going on</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="3.18">president Trump is talking about a lot</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="4.56">of things probably the most important</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="5.1">tweet that really we&amp;#39;re not gonna talk</text>
  <text start="223.16" dur="4.35">about too many of them but the big the</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="7.5">one that really jumped out at me is this</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="8.4">one right here mark Meadows saying this</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="6.87">week President Trump was able to do</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="6.75">something no one else could get the left</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="6.77">to care about foreign intelligence in</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="7.59">our elections yeah</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="7.33">Trump with the chess move this week he</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="6.33">says you&amp;#39;d think Democrats paying for</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="5.159">Oppo research from Russians then</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="4.14">funneling it to deal Jay to open</text>
  <text start="258.919" dur="6.331">investigation would have done the trick</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="7.29">guess not yeah and this is where we are</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="8.85">the left can&amp;#39;t eat can keep firing off</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="7.92">their blanks and keep attacking with</text>
  <text start="274.1" dur="5.189">their words it won&amp;#39;t make a difference</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="5.909">and I want to</text>
  <text start="279.289" dur="5.46">play a little clip you know president</text>
  <text start="281.839" dur="4.55">Trump is he put this little video let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.749" dur="4.98">listen to a little bit of what jason</text>
  <text start="286.389" dur="5.53">Chaffetz had to say recently so willing</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="3.601">to Morton how did that sit with you when</text>
  <text start="291.919" dur="4.83">you heard the president say that in this</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="5.25">new interview well you need to listen to</text>
  <text start="296.749" dur="4.35">what he said first he said he would do</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="4.259">both he would inform the FBI and he</text>
  <text start="301.099" dur="5.34">would listen and if that was wrong he</text>
  <text start="302.839" dur="6.961">would escalate it to the FBI this this</text>
  <text start="306.439" dur="5.611">foe this fake outrage from the left and</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="4.47">the media is is just it&amp;#39;s part of a</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="4.409">pattern here you remember it was Hillary</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="4.979">Clinton&amp;#39;s husband the former President</text>

  <text start="330.979" dur="3.75">candidate for the presidency of the</text>
  <text start="332.779" dur="5.22">United States there was no outrage on</text>
  <text start="334.729" dur="5.22">that they were expecting taking $500,000</text>
  <text start="337.999" dur="4.741">out of Russia for instance and other</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="5.55">countries it&amp;#39;s come on they are faking</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="4.739">the idea that they&amp;#39;re exasperated by the</text>
  <text start="345.499" dur="5.7">president&amp;#39;s answer of course he can</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="4.891">listen and there it is jason Chaffetz</text>
  <text start="351.199" dur="2.01">putting it out there for public</text>

  <text start="490.82" dur="4.74">Patriots have set up their trap they are</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="4.32">seeing this because they these</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="5.52">whistleblowers they know what is</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="5.84">happening and I guarantee you they are</text>

  <text start="537.86" dur="6.9">Attorney General Bill Barr US Attorney</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="5.4">John Durham are actually working to</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="6.5">bring justice</text>
  <text start="546.71" dur="9.27">that was the optical effect of having</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="9.1">bar and now Durham rolling out into the</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="7.59">light these stealth bombers the Patriots</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="5.4">when they set up this plan they knew</text>
  <text start="563.57" dur="4.019">that would be the net effect of what is</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="3.87">happening and now it&amp;#39;s all perfectly</text>
  <text start="567.589" dur="4.591">working exactly like they planned it all</text>

  <text start="580.67" dur="5.729">General bar and John Durham are willing</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="5.761">to get to the bottom of it yeah as the</text>
  <text start="586.399" dur="5.041">freedom caucus chairman said people that</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="5.04">were perhaps afraid under previous</text>
  <text start="591.44" dur="5.43">leadership to actually say that well we</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="7.259">knew this was wrong they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="596.87" dur="6.42">forward now yeah it&amp;#39;s all happening</text>
