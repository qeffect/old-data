  <text start="243.19" dur="7.019">millions spits on the very country that</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="5.94">have made that possible and anyway this</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="6.301">demon posted a pre Civil War quote from</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="5.489">Frederick Douglass accompanied by a</text>

  <text start="282.02" dur="7.669">place but because they want to cash in</text>
  <text start="286.639" dur="5.911">on the very freedom that we as Patriots</text>
  <text start="289.689" dur="4.121">celebrated today this is the reason</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="4.079">right here everything in this</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="5.43">celebration is the reason why that demon</text>
  <text start="296.629" dur="5.28">is able to say what he&amp;#39;s saying and that</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="4.139">is the reason why these demons are able</text>
  <text start="301.909" dur="3.72">to burn the flank and know they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="303.379" dur="4.681">get away with it even though there were</text>

  <text start="311.719" dur="5.521">being on our side of history and that</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="7.35">and being a patriot also with that comes</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="6.329">the patience that comes from God and</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="4.53">this willingness to accept other</text>
  <text start="323.569" dur="5.701">opinions that are different from ours</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="5.729">without requiring that to resort to</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="3.54">violence and without accusing our</text>
  <text start="331.159" dur="3.87">enemies of being automatically you know</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.68">like Nazis automatically just because</text>
