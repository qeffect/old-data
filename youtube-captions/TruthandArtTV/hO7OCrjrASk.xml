  <text start="486.52" dur="4.379">itself as the core of fact-finding</text>
  <text start="488.469" dur="4.5">effort though that function has</text>
  <text start="490.899" dur="4.8">traditionally been handled by the House</text>
  <text start="492.969" dur="4.741">Judiciary Committee which will begin its</text>
  <text start="495.699" dur="3.3">own hearings on Wednesday one part</text>

  <text start="520.419" dur="3.42">like what it says here as former Obama</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="4.11">administration official Cass Sunstein</text>
  <text start="523.839" dur="4.351">wrote in 2017 abuse of power is an</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="3.719">insufficient basis for impeachment</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="4.709">because it would apply to every</text>
  <text start="530.079" dur="4.661">president all of whom arguably overstep</text>
  <text start="532.899" dur="3.761">the bounds of their authority and on</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="3.75">not and it goes on the report claims</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="4.17">that the first step in the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="5.55">scheme involved removing US ambassador</text>

  <text start="648.529" dur="4.411">started bringing all kinds of complaints</text>

  <text start="652.94" dur="4.23">is going on can you tell us a real short</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="3.9">version of how they tried to take down</text>
  <text start="657.17" dur="2.58">Devon Nunez because he was on to</text>
  <text start="659.12" dur="2.43">something</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="3.3">sure they went after him in a whole</text>
  <text start="661.55" dur="3.81">bunch of different ways they filed a</text>
  <text start="663.05" dur="4.79">whole bunch of ethics complaints they</text>
  <text start="665.36" dur="6.31">threatened him they threatened his</text>

  <text start="697.36" dur="4.08">he still is walking through fire and the</text>
  <text start="699.64" dur="3.84">reason they targeted him is because he</text>
