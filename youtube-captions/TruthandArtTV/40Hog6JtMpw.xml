  <text start="257.66" dur="5.91">on instead as you could see in the</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="6.72">bottom part he begins to spew nonsense</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="6.93">attacking Joe M says I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="7.08">slick video with excellent pictures and</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.37">media clips all taken out of context</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="3.8">somehow and news by the narrator to</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="4.35">create a conspiracy theory document</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="4.96">docudrama that weaves together a</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="5.37">disjointed version of facts that are</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="6.01">woven together in an effort to create a</text>

  <text start="299.07" dur="3.84">psychology textbook and that was one of</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="3.51">my degree so I know what he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="6.15">say but he&amp;#39;s completely wrong and he</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="6.95">goes on to destroy anyone who tries to</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="6.6">follow truth and he supports the</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="6.28">mainstream deep state version of 9/11 as</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="5.4">you could see in his arguments and then</text>

  <text start="1067.95" dur="3.71">compliments about his election victory</text>
  <text start="1069.81" dur="4.47">and support from evangelical voters</text>

  <text start="1095.16" dur="5.91">permanently in Congress right there</text>
  <text start="1098.07" dur="5.97">but Trump says I signed an executive</text>
  <text start="1101.07" dur="5.61">order so that now people like you that</text>
  <text start="1104.04" dur="5.49">want to hear from ministers and and</text>
  <text start="1106.68" dur="6.6">preachers and rabbis and whoever it may</text>
  <text start="1109.53" dur="6.39">be they can speak right there share this</text>

  <text start="1122.79" dur="5.55">and these politic they want to twist</text>
  <text start="1125.85" dur="4.95">things around Trump admit it that the</text>
  <text start="1128.34" dur="4.77">actual amendment was not completely</text>
  <text start="1130.8" dur="6.24">gotten rid of but he signed an executive</text>
  <text start="1133.11" dur="6.51">order to basically nullify it so that it</text>
  <text start="1137.04" dur="4.89">they cannot enforce it and so these</text>
  <text start="1139.62" dur="3.72">people say it goes on here you quote you</text>
  <text start="1141.93" dur="3.93">know you couldn&amp;#39;t speak politically</text>
  <text start="1143.34" dur="4.74">before now you can&amp;#39;t Trump is saying and</text>
  <text start="1145.86" dur="4.8">I want to hear from you and others that</text>

  <text start="1150.66" dur="3.75">Trump&amp;#39;s comments to Robertson left us</text>
  <text start="1152.52" dur="4.17">wondering if in fact Trump had gotten</text>
  <text start="1154.41" dur="4.29">rid of the Johnson amendment and they go</text>
  <text start="1156.69" dur="4.53">on to say politics and religion experts</text>
