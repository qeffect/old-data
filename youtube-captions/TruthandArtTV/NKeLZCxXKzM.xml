  <text start="973.769" dur="7.56">Iranian state propaganda of course and</text>
  <text start="977.029" dur="7.12">but it could be a real CIA operation</text>
  <text start="981.329" dur="4.26">broken up that one of their operations</text>
  <text start="984.149" dur="4.5">working with the deep state and saying</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="7.141">you know just for for optical reasons</text>

  <text start="1020.99" dur="5.52">deals yeah back then somehow they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1024.319" dur="3.87">have this spying the special kind so</text>
  <text start="1026.51" dur="4.289">yeah you really have to take the story</text>
  <text start="1028.189" dur="5.15">with a grain of salt and in some ways</text>
  <text start="1030.799" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s ironic that they would put this out</text>
  <text start="1033.339" dur="5.23">just see what you think about that and</text>

  <text start="1119.83" dur="5.28">thing here no one should be surprised</text>
  <text start="1121.78" dur="6.029">that the alternative media will jump on</text>
  <text start="1125.11" dur="5.309">this as saying oh this is faith this is</text>
  <text start="1127.809" dur="5.331">not true the attacking the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="1130.419" dur="5.221">the Pentagon like and and then you have</text>
  <text start="1133.14" dur="4.539">Trump like every single day coming out</text>
  <text start="1135.64" dur="5.669">and Mike Pompeo saying the same thing</text>
