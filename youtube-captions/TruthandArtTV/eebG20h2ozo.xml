  <text start="135.95" dur="5.99">and maybe 30 seconds the overall picture</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="4.71">what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing the left</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="3.82">because we know cue said we got what we</text>
  <text start="144.8" dur="3.6">need it and what</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="5.759">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is the Patriots</text>
  <text start="148.4" dur="6.63">have control of the executive branch and</text>
  <text start="151.519" dur="7.591">the judicial branch of government and</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="6.36">the deep State the Dems have control of</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="4.56">the legislative branch and because of</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="4.95">that they are fluffing up we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="4.83">see tonight again these stories to keep</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="4.83">the word impeachment in the</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="5.459">consciousness of the people even though</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s nothing to impeach about Nancy</text>
  <text start="173.959" dur="5.61">knows this and Nadler knows this but at</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="4.83">the same time the Patriots it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="179.569" dur="5.221">closer and closer as we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="5.849">tonight to justice and before we get</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.789">started we have no new cue drums but I</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="6.03">do want to remind people that a year ago</text>
  <text start="189.579" dur="7.03">the cue team took a big break between</text>
  <text start="193.519" dur="5.731">May 22nd and June 3rd we all remember</text>
  <text start="196.609" dur="6.99">that and then another big break between</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="6.329">June 3rd and June 10th and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.599" dur="4.561">seeing this year is very similar the</text>
  <text start="205.579" dur="5.49">difference is that last year there was</text>
  <text start="208.16" dur="4.939">that one drop on June 3rd and that one</text>
  <text start="211.069" dur="5.221">drop was the image of a gun look at that</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="5.441">black out necessary cue telling so again</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re seeing this year a</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="8.009">very similar pattern see what you think</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="6.45">about that and then we see on the Trump</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="4.171">present Trump Twitter account and how</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="5.28">much is going on president Trump is in</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="6.69">Iowa so we&amp;#39;ll keep an eye on that let us</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="6.33">get directly into some key stories here</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="3.81">it is what I was saying a second ago we</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="5.129">have the Dems</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="6.78">keeping this illusion the the</text>
  <text start="245.389" dur="4.801">legislative branch they are keeping this</text>
  <text start="248" dur="4.68">illusion that maybe there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="5.12">about something about something about</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="6.6">something that we could possibly find</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="5.47">theoretically somewhere deep if we did</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="3.509">deep enough maybe there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="4.139">microscopic reason for impeaching the</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="4.021">president and even if there isn&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="3.78">keep digging and then we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="4.41">the digging that we&amp;#39;re doing and if we</text>
  <text start="268.699" dur="4.711">can&amp;#39;t find impeachment we&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="3.9">talking about how we cannot find</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="3.41">impeachment and how it&amp;#39;s still not over</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="4.38">yet and maybe we could still impeach</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="4.6">yeah that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="3.78">and because of that we have this</text>
  <text start="281.42" dur="4.47">headline House Democrats vote to take</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="6.63">bar mcgann to court to enforce subpoena</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="6.27">doesn&amp;#39;t matter gentlemen because William</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="5.85">bar has followed the law he cannot</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="5.91">reveal sources and they all have all the</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="4.2">results we already know no collusion no</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.11">obstruction they know that Nadler knows</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="3.93">that they all know this but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="4.23">matter they need to keep the narrative</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="5.25">going what better way to keep the</text>
  <text start="306.41" dur="6.03">narrative going than to exercise what</text>
  <text start="309.14" dur="4.92">little power you have face it people</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="2.67">this is why I was mentioning this about</text>
  <text start="314.06" dur="3.9">this whole thing about the three</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="6.87">branches and the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="6.959">that the Dems have you know they have</text>
  <text start="321.98" dur="5.76">some power but small P little tiny bit</text>
  <text start="324.919" dur="6.031">of power the legislative branch has the</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="6.48">ability to sit down and throw together a</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="5.07">vote and have all the Dems vote because</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="5.64">they have the majority and there it is</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="6.12">229 to 191 House Democrats approve a</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="5.01">measure that would allow committee</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="5.46">chairmen in an unprecedented fast-track</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.77">fashion to go to federal court to seek</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="5.069">enforcement of their nothing burger</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="5.55">subpoenas again is not the end result</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="4.56">that they are concerned about although</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="3.63">the Young Democrats the socialists</text>
  <text start="357.229" dur="3.511">communists Democrats they might be</text>
  <text start="358.82" dur="3.09">talking that way but they know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="3.929">not gonna get the result there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="5.94">to look for it is they the process that</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="4.891">they are in love with and is what the</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="4.35">process that they need to keep putting</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="3.63">out there ask this woman right here she</text>

  <text start="377" dur="3.96">to starting impeachment but the only</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="5.85">thing that matters is that we are</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="6.48">talking about impeachment even if the</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="5.43">headline is about not being close to</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="5.67">impeachment that is how this works</text>
