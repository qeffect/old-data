  <text start="6.93" dur="5.339">present some code to you some secret</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="5.099">coded messages on the queue and on board</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="4.981">and there has been some discussion about</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="4.111">this I&amp;#39;m not going to go into all of the</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.279">different options maybe in the future</text>
  <text start="19.17" dur="5.82">maybe but right now I think that this is</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="6.24">the best explanation so far I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="8.58">all kinds of stuff about the clas and</text>
  <text start="28.769" dur="7.38">brackets code class code I have looked</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="5.85">everywhere on the internet I cannot find</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="5.481">anything so I did run across this post</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="4.91">it was posted</text>
  <text start="41.63" dur="3.99">maybe two days ago I think two or three</text>
  <text start="44.33" dur="3.18">days ago I&amp;#39;ve been reading about it kind</text>
  <text start="45.62" dur="4.1">of off and on there&amp;#39;s a lot to take in</text>
  <text start="47.51" dur="5.34">and I have not figured this out a</text>
  <text start="49.72" dur="4.6">hundred percent yet so this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="52.85" dur="4.23">call to action to the people that watch</text>
  <text start="54.32" dur="4.47">these videos people that support me any</text>
  <text start="57.08" dur="4.53">of you out there that are interested in</text>
  <text start="58.79" dur="4.83">taking this conversation forward please</text>
  <text start="61.61" dur="3.839">please put your information in the</text>
  <text start="63.62" dur="4.59">comments make it clear I&amp;#39;ll pin the</text>
  <text start="65.449" dur="4.951">comments I&amp;#39;ll like them favor them and</text>
  <text start="68.21" dur="4.56">then I&amp;#39;ll post a follow-up video because</text>
  <text start="70.4" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m not gonna get I&amp;#39;m not gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="72.77" dur="2.82">how to fully decode these things and I</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="2.64">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="75.59" dur="3.779">one-stop shop there&amp;#39;s not a single</text>
  <text start="77.24" dur="4.47">method I think to doing this and this</text>
  <text start="79.369" dur="5.041">that&amp;#39;s what this guy&amp;#39;s pointing out so</text>
  <text start="81.71" dur="5.37">these are two posts that he points to</text>
  <text start="84.41" dur="4.74">that has this class coded in it these</text>
  <text start="87.08" dur="6.08">brackets okay some people are calling it</text>
  <text start="89.15" dur="6.27">the kill box right inside of boxed</text>
  <text start="93.16" dur="4.36">brackets so they&amp;#39;re calling it the kill</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="4.86">box but it&amp;#39;s not always that way</text>
  <text start="97.52" dur="5.7">so you know for instance right here okay</text>
  <text start="100.28" dur="7.8">NSA no such agency is not in the kill</text>
  <text start="103.22" dur="7.53">box all right it&amp;#39;s not it points to</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="5.88">something else so what this guy says his</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="5.22">name is gnarly gnarly that&amp;#39;s this guy</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="6.21">right so thanks dude for putting this</text>
  <text start="115.97" dur="6.41">together so his tweet reads Q NSA</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="6.18">pledged allegiance to the Republic</text>
  <text start="122.38" dur="8.71">decoded brackets from post 576 to 577</text>
  <text start="126.35" dur="7.02">for the message class clas all caps is a</text>
  <text start="131.09" dur="5.52">prefix and modifiers from graphical</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.49">logic basically it&amp;#39;s a sophisticated way</text>
  <text start="136.61" dur="5.43">to say cut and paste it&amp;#39;s an acronym</text>
  <text start="138.86" dur="6.54">likely to mean quote cut lift and</text>
  <text start="142.04" dur="7.08">substitute so it means take this out and</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="6.72">then put something else of there and</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="6.449">this is the infographic that he uses to</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="5.13">explain it now I&amp;#39;m not going to explain</text>
  <text start="155.569" dur="2.701">all this to you somebody down there in</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="3">the comments please put this together</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="3.63">alright again I&amp;#39;ll make a follow-up to</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="3.99">this but I just want to introduce people</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="5.669">to this subject matter so we can further</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="6.45">the conversation okay I get a lot out of</text>
  <text start="167.569" dur="6.211">what you guys write so comes out of</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="4.66">graphical logic infographics says that</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="5.89">no such agency to</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="6.69">place class cut lifted substitute so in</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="7.38">this post right here if I could just say</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="6.72">it this is a reply to another post I</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="5.94">wish I could get this off here for you</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="6.81">but you can see it so he is replying to</text>
  <text start="192.99" dur="3.18">a previous post by saying the flood is</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="3.72">coming</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="6.54">there&amp;#39;s emails videos audio pics FBI</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="6.12">accidentally deletes texts NSA</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="4.17">accidentally releases it all shall we</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="5.49">play a game and this is tied into the</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="7.62">last video I did with what was at the</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="5.37">five five yes maybe it&amp;#39;s Clinton in</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="3.06">brackets maybe it&amp;#39;s the tarmac meeting</text>
  <text start="216.27" dur="7.8">maybe it&amp;#39;s all kinds of other stuff</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="9.6">could be a package of things but these</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="6.48">posts are all linked together so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="6.35">a post okay it&amp;#39;s replied to and then</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s replied to again over here on 577</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="9.16">so post 577 says expand your thinking</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="7.68">plan three in brackets moves and</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="6.09">countermoves strategy warfare this week</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="10.62">will be revealing snow white one two and</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="9.03">five offline seventh floor is no more</text>
  <text start="256.23" dur="3.569">just because you can&amp;#39;t see it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="5.34">mean big things aren&amp;#39;t happening night</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="5.341">writers fly 2008 will be glorious okay</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="6.24">so this seventh floor this may</text>
  <text start="265.14" dur="5.88">correspond to the SES stuff okay people</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="3.45">are saying that&amp;#39;s the keystone now I</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.73">think the keystone points in multiple</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="7.64">locations but the SES stuff my problem</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="3.71">with that is that it seems too</text>
  <text start="281.29" dur="5.91">easy okay if you go to the SES webpage</text>
  <text start="284.98" dur="5.46">it says it&amp;#39;s the keystone of whatever</text>
  <text start="287.2" dur="4.83">but the Keystone is a metaphor okay and</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="5.82">metaphors are used all kinds of places</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="6.51">so I I think as deep as Q is gotten I</text>
  <text start="296.26" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t know if he would make that as easy</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="3.78">as it was defined and why didn&amp;#39;t we find</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="3.33">it three or four months ago maybe we did</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="3.42">maybe it just didn&amp;#39;t get surfaced on the</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="3.33">YouTube community it&amp;#39;s really where I</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="3.38">spend most of my time as YouTube and</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="5.64">Twitter sometimes I visit the chance</text>
  <text start="309.12" dur="6.01">okay but somebody was saying earlier</text>
  <text start="312.79" dur="4.5">that Snow White had seven okay there was</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="5.7">the Seven Dwarves or whatever and one</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="5.43">two and five or offline that&amp;#39;s one way</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="5.43">to read it so there may be the other</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="5.07">three snow white servers the Seven maybe</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="4.5">the other four the Seven Dwarves are</text>
  <text start="327.79" dur="6.06">still online maybe okay but another way</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="5.61">to read this is to just say expand your</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="4.17">thinking it&amp;#39;s planned moves and</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="4.56">countermoves strategy warfare this week</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="5.73">will be relieving revealing Snow White</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="4.95">offline and the rest of this stuff these</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="4.38">bracketed words are these bracketed</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="5.01">numbers are just packed in as a way to</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="4.8">get past the censors or a way to provide</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="3.48">you the intense code that you basically</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="4.77">need to figure this thing out with okay</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.33">so I&amp;#39;ll move on that&amp;#39;s just a different</text>
  <text start="357.7" dur="4.71">way to read these posts so on the right</text>
  <text start="360.7" dur="7.02">he puts it together in this infographic</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="6.24">it says class - n - d i underscore 9 no</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="4.23">such agency</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="7.29">so the NS a and no such agency is on the</text>
  <text start="371.95" dur="10.34">end of that same quantifier so you put</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="6.35">an essay where the word class is and</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="8.77">let&amp;#39;s see in through D means insert</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="6.9">directly okay so we substituted NSA for</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="6.54">the first part of the string and through</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="7.62">d means substitute directly i underscore</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="6.12">tells you to locate the insertion string</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="5.1">at the front of the message so when you</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="3.92">aggregate all the text when you put this</text>
  <text start="405.76" dur="7.08">all together all the text boxes you have</text>
  <text start="407.73" dur="7.12">NSA three in brackets then 1 comma 2</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="4.11">comma and 5 in brackets</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="5.25">and when you highlight the words three</text>
  <text start="416.95" dur="5.19">one two and five of a secret text and</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="7.5">include them in the order that they</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="8.55">appear on the page the full result is no</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="6">such agency pledged allegiance to the</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="5.58">Republic and he says I bet you can find</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="3.87">the source of this text and I spent a</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="3.48">little bit of time lining this up to the</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="3.45">Pledge of Allegiance and I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="4.32">what I got because I did this a couple</text>
  <text start="440.92" dur="5.13">days ago so that&amp;#39;s one open thing right</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="4.56">there here&amp;#39;s the open question can you</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="5.01">find it can you find the source of the</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="6">secret text it may just be as simple as</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="5.67">the Pledge of Allegiance and on the</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="3.51">right kind of points that out okay</text>
  <text start="456.73" dur="3.18">pledge of allegiance to the United</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="4.68">States and Republic for which it stands</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="7.98">one under God and justice applause hand</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="6.75">hid so I think there is a better way to</text>
  <text start="467.89" dur="4.88">do this infographic I think this</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="6.06">infographic is a a tremendous effort</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="6.01">okay a tremendous effort and a great</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="5.19">right step step in the correct direction</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="4.11">but I think that we can make a better</text>
  <text start="480.82" dur="3.9">one and I think somebody should and then</text>
  <text start="482.89" dur="3.96">you should give me the link so that I</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="6.09">can more easily explain this to the</text>
  <text start="486.85" dur="6.9">viewers in the audience okay so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="4.2">the first one and that&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="2.85">he&amp;#39;s talking about was this was this</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="6.72">with these coded messages and one thing</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="7.5">he points to is this graphical logic now</text>
  <text start="501.73" dur="4.44">I spent some time digging okay but</text>
  <text start="504.1" dur="5.4">before I tell you about that he did post</text>
  <text start="506.17" dur="4.83">two replies to his first post and the</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="3.3">first one he says is graphical logic</text>
  <text start="511" dur="3.87">that Q is using may look complicated but</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s really not just think cut and paste</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="4.229">but where do you paste there are a few</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="5.13">codes to figure out but they mean simple</text>
  <text start="519.099" dur="6.091">things like paste at the front or insert</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="5.67">at the end of the rest you&amp;#39;ll bag some</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="3.9">decodes for us and this is this is the</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="3.39">infographic that&amp;#39;s there just so you can</text>
  <text start="529.09" dur="3.09">see it okay it says when you see the</text>
  <text start="531.01" dur="2.72">string in brackets it means you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="4.05">substituting an alternative text</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="6.37">provided in a separate set of brackets</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="7.22">and some of these posts are linked to</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="6.72">each other or they&amp;#39;re dropped in</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="4.96">sequence or the replied to themselves or</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re dropped together</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="3.54">so it&amp;#39;s kind of a lot of different stuff</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="2.97">here and here&amp;#39;s another one I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="2.46">going to spend too much time on this one</text>
  <text start="553.03" dur="3.42">because this is gonna confuse a bunch of</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="4.68">people but it talks about the defense</text>
  <text start="556.45" dur="13.11">condition of Hawaii was george w bush</text>
  <text start="559.09" dur="12.15">and war games like clockwork okay so we</text>

  <text start="833.27" dur="8.43">until his death in 1914 and it has it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.73" dur="4.65">a way to graph out logic and some people</text>
  <text start="841.7" dur="4.08">say that there was a dead end because it</text>
  <text start="843.38" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t really stand up in certain</text>
