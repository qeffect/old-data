  <text start="246.42" dur="8.31">puts us on the 11th but we&amp;#39;re like well</text>
  <text start="249.3" dur="8.999">why did he pick the 11th all right well</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="6.09">this I spy account says it it what is he</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="6.691">saying he says the reason is because</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s a reference to mi a&amp;#39;s paper planes</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="4.05">which is like all those videos he put up</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.04">with that stringer I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="8.46">color codes maybe it&amp;#39;s a public key</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="9.62">encryption or private key there&amp;#39;s a link</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="7.139">right here so I guess on 6 9 he met with</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="4.66">mi a so people are saying look it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="4.231">year from this time when he met with</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="4.5">this artist who made this song about</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="5.519">Paper Planes talking about having more</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.51">records than the KGB and it&amp;#39;s that date</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="6.061">but it&amp;#39;s not okay supposedly it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="5.819">anniversary from that date which is 2017</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="5.4">six nine but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s it I</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="4.801">think it has to be much more important</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="6.24">than that if it if it is in fact an</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.97">anniversary here&amp;#39;s the link to that</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="4.65">article just so you can see it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="6.81">anniversary date for that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s June 9th 2017 so if they were</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="4.26">gonna pick a day they would pick June</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="4.41">9th 2018 that&amp;#39;s the anniversary of the</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="5.909">meet up with m.i.a and the paper planes</text>
  <text start="327" dur="7.02">and yada yada here&amp;#39;s what I think okay</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="5.371">this is just my initial thought I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="7.55">thinking his name was Seth rich that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.6" dur="9.48">what I&amp;#39;m thinking look at the dates</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="11.08">Seth rich was murdered on July 10th 2016</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="8.52">by two members of ms-13 who were then</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="5.82">capped to cover up any kind of loose</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="5.85">strings so I don&amp;#39;t really have a point</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="3.9">of reference here I&amp;#39;m just this is just</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m throwing something out there so you</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="4.38">can do your own research we can move the</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="8.7">conversation along this way but this is</text>
  <text start="366.75" dur="7.89">about one month after June 11th right so</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="5.009">that&amp;#39;s about one month after that so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="5.64">thinking that that&amp;#39;s the day that Seth</text>
  <text start="377.789" dur="6.511">rich leaked out the DNC papers</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="7.29">DNC emails I&amp;#39;m thinking June 11th 2016</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="6.24">is the day that Seth rich leaked all</text>
  <text start="387.57" dur="5.61">that stuff to WikiLeaks and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="6.51">thinking that it took them about a month</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="8.4">to figure out who leaked it narrow it</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="6.42">down confirm it and then pop him if you</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="4.32">remember it wasn&amp;#39;t a robbery that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="5.33">they framed it on it was clearly a</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="5.19">political hit this guy was uh he was</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="3.97">responsible for like their analytics or</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="4.95">something he was director of analytics</text>
  <text start="412.77" dur="5.49">for the DNC and he was a bernie guy okay</text>
  <text start="416.04" dur="4.68">he did not really want Clinton to win</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="3.12">and when he saw that it was it was a</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="3.33">done deal</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="4.289">even before the primary Seth rich leaked</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="3.45">out some papers a month later he was</text>
  <text start="425.669" dur="8.341">dead and I think that&amp;#39;s what lines up</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="7.77">with that with that date so if I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="434.01" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="4.02">all right maybe it&amp;#39;s true maybe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m going with right now I</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="4.29">think it&amp;#39;s got to be way more important</text>
  <text start="441" dur="3.66">than the the m.i.a thing that was</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="7.88">referenced which doesn&amp;#39;t even match up</text>
  <text start="444.66" dur="6.8">with an anniversary carrying on I</text>
  <text start="453.229" dur="5.801">thought this was funny I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="456.539" dur="5.221">else to say the fact that someone would</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="9.36">take two hours and twelve minutes out of</text>
  <text start="461.76" dur="8.94">their life like whatever man</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="4.89">like I don&amp;#39;t what&amp;#39;s your point like you</text>
