  <text start="6.39" dur="5.73">wanting to cover some more information</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="5.46">related to a previous video I did so in</text>
  <text start="12.12" dur="6.03">a previous video there was some ties to</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="9.409">boom and the capstone make it rain the</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="9.92">Rainmaker WikiLeaks vault 7 and the CIA</text>
  <text start="23.779" dur="7.42">hacking tools in a class-action lawsuit</text>
  <text start="28.07" dur="5.919">but some of that stuff might pertain to</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="4.171">this it might pertain to both you know I</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="4.101">could be wrong about the whole thing</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s just kind of up for discussion so I</text>
  <text start="38.09" dur="3.52">just feel like we should cover this or I</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="2.94">should cover this as well I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="4.35">if anybody has really gone into detail</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="5.22">about this but it talks about the</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="7.02">stringer code and it kind of ties into</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="7.89">the the Keystone and the Keystone could</text>
  <text start="52.98" dur="4.95">just be a way to decipher coded messages</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="3.84">on these stringer programs or these</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="7.61">stringer codes that were covered in some</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="8.94">of the earlier q and on posts so around</text>
  <text start="65.54" dur="7.63">Thanksgiving of 2017 there was a number</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="8.19">of coded messages put on 4chan by the QA</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="6.33">team and here&amp;#39;s one with red one red two</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="4.5">we kind of knew what it really tied to</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="3.93">but I really never really got to the</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="7.189">bottom of what the coded messages were</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="8.549">now I&amp;#39;m on cue and on dot pub so HTTP</text>
  <text start="88.939" dur="4.601">cueing on dot pub it&amp;#39;s a good place to</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="3.481">come search and sometimes they give you</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="3.99">the answers for some of these this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="5.07">one I&amp;#39;ve looked at before but this is</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="4.53">kind of how you can go go through it so</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="3.03">it says generally the term red would</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="5.519">indicate either a high level of</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="8.129">preparedness also a team color red Blue</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="5.671">Team Red Team Blue team so you know even</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="3.231">this website has some different</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="4.53">interpretations for some of these things</text>
  <text start="114.92" dur="5.379">red one red two could also mean what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="5.1">about to get into which is the Red Cross</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="5.67">and that&amp;#39;s what some of this stuff ties</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="5.489">down to and I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="4.441">contribute everything in this article or</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="3.781">this this video but I&amp;#39;ll try to get</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.18">through as much as I can we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="6.89">focus on this long one</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="10.89">so this one right here post number 229</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="7.089">it&amp;#39;s a big long stringer message now</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="3.06">when I used to look at this I used to</text>
  <text start="146.129" dur="5.64">think well these are probably just like</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="7.11">these look like coated go orders for</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="5.071">different types of I don&amp;#39;t know secret</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="3.36">operations I know from some of the</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="2.82">earlier posts that we&amp;#39;re not the only</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="4.559">ones looking at this it&amp;#39;s not just for</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="5.07">us it&amp;#39;s for some other people who need</text>
  <text start="162.569" dur="3.301">to see these messages in order to make a</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="4.11">decision on their part</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="6.869">so the Kuna team military intelligence</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="5.28">maybe even the bad people it&amp;#39;s all being</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="3.961">monitored by a lot of different people</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="4.02">and it&amp;#39;s got different purposes so</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s what I thought a lot of this was</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="5.069">for and maybe it is maybe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.629">though so we&amp;#39;re gonna take a look at</text>
  <text start="183.209" dur="6.151">this other article this this big long</text>
  <text start="186.049" dur="5.141">document I&amp;#39;ve alluded to before so this</text>
  <text start="189.36" dur="5.879">is the document okay it&amp;#39;s all about the</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="9.69">Qun on posts it&amp;#39;s a the version I have</text>
  <text start="195.239" dur="8.821">was up to date as of 2:15 18 so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="5.85">referred to this several times and if we</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="4.44">dig down to page 471 we can find</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.56">basically just a meme it&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="6.329">infographic meme of what this post is</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="8.309">all about and if we zoom in we can look</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="9.69">at we can see what this what this this</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="7.801">post was encoded with and it points to</text>
  <text start="224.519" dur="5.161">the red cross and I&amp;#39;ll go through this</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.339">real quick with you it&amp;#39;s not important I</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="5.82">think to understand the whole thing but</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="8.411">these these encoded this big big long</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="6.78">stringer points to human trafficking and</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="7.29">all kinds of crazy stuff but it starts</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="7.859">with Z B C so instead of ABC it&amp;#39;s zbc on</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="6.629">the end Z&amp;#39;s the 26 letters of the</text>
  <text start="250.139" dur="5.43">alphabet and then 2 &amp;amp; 3 is B and C and</text>
  <text start="254.069" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re saying that the pattern was</text>
  <text start="255.569" dur="5.73">established at the first point saying</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="7.351">it&amp;#39;s a two digit code so two digits for</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.621">all subsequent codes so it says eb c y</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.41">xt</text>
  <text start="265.92" dur="5.31">and CH and CH is the first decryption</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="4.44">key and that gives us 38 if you add</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="4.02">those letters together I guess I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="3.36">verified that actually I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="3.48">that does so maybe it&amp;#39;s these two</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="7.32">letters the value of these two letters</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="7.35">plus the 26 but that would give us 38 so</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="5.67">you look at the the ones with the</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="7.8">letters on the ends of them okay and you</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="6.9">add them all up and it becomes this</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.8">stringer code taking all the values and</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.31">then separating them into two values</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.86">each and there&amp;#39;s a second decryption key</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="2.67">which I&amp;#39;m not really going to go into it</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="2.91">gets a little complicated and the third</text>
  <text start="304.89" dur="3.78">decryption key so we&amp;#39;re just gonna go</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="3.72">with the easy stuff and basically when</text>
  <text start="308.67" dur="5.49">you get through it you end up with red</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="6.09">and then you can also decode children</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="6.15">out of this using the extra decoded keys</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="7.11">and you end up with red red which is a</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="4.41">Red Cross and then children was spelled</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="5.43">wrong that&amp;#39;s for the second red comes</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="6">from chilled red in so it&amp;#39;s a fairly</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="3.3">complicated stuff and it&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="330.72" dur="8.73">deep and there was a lot of information</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="14.04">here it&amp;#39;s not just this so the there was</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="9.12">a later post on 12 for now on 12 for we</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="5.34">get you know who is Peter struck he</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="5.67">shows up in the q post and then we get</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="4.74">fly Roth&amp;#39;s fly and the ruff child&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="3.45">tied into the Red Cross it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="4.17">like their fundraising arm for doing a</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.8">bunch of really bad stuff and it starts</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="6.21">talking about red red again AIDS videos</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="6.42">more stuff about Peter struck weiner</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="7.83">emails more Red Cross more Red Cross</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="7.26">stringer video and on this one that says</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="3.42">this is the one that I was just pointing</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.88">to in that previous post but it says</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="4.77">learn to decider now hang on to that for</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="2.46">a second</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s more in here talks about more</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="7.02">red cross more red cross why did Husain</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="6.45">travel to Asia expand your thinking Red</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="5.01">Cross Red Cross stringer is red red Asia</text>
  <text start="394.23" dur="4.179">dates are these dates which show up</text>
  <text start="396.54" dur="4.149">again and</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="5.9">and then it ties into North and South</text>
  <text start="400.689" dur="7.29">Korea and it&amp;#39;s talking about Pyeongchang</text>
  <text start="404.309" dur="6.22">Pyongyang sorry over the military in the</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="4.47">Red Cross talks the situation come</text>
  <text start="410.529" dur="3.78">quickly can quickly change and North</text>
  <text start="412.449" dur="7.68">Korea could feel the need for dialogue</text>
  <text start="414.309" dur="7.41">and again this is Red Cross red red so</text>
  <text start="420.129" dur="4.53">there was a lot of tie in with this and</text>
  <text start="421.719" dur="6.9">now we&amp;#39;ve just found out recently in the</text>
  <text start="424.659" dur="7.08">last week that I mean Trump just dropped</text>
  <text start="428.619" dur="5.07">a bombshell on Twitter and basically</text>
  <text start="431.739" dur="4.38">said he&amp;#39;s gonna meet now with North</text>
  <text start="433.689" dur="4.111">Korea something that no one thought</text>
  <text start="436.119" dur="3.3">would ever happen and then there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="4.769">other people in the post talking about</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="5.49">how that already happened during Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.569" dur="7.791">Asia trip bout back around the same</text>
  <text start="444.909" dur="8.04">timeline so to get back to the same post</text>
  <text start="450.36" dur="5.139">you know I pointed out to learn to</text>
  <text start="452.949" dur="5.19">decider and they say you know the</text>
  <text start="455.499" dur="5.28">misspellings are important so it says</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="7.17">that the difference between decider and</text>
  <text start="460.779" dur="6.45">decipher are the Y in the pH Y meaning</text>
  <text start="465.309" dur="4.2">the go ahead symbolism that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="467.229" dur="5.16">before I can show you a picture of that</text>
  <text start="469.509" dur="4.38">later which means basically satanic and</text>
  <text start="472.389" dur="3.51">then pH meaning of blood type so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.889" dur="4.98">talking about satanic blood here just</text>
  <text start="475.899" dur="4.62">based on the why pH I know this is kind</text>
  <text start="478.869" dur="4.86">of deep and it seems like a lot of</text>
  <text start="480.519" dur="5.61">stretch for some people but this is this</text>
  <text start="483.729" dur="4.95">is what it means like this is I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="486.129" dur="4.56">confident that it either has a double</text>
  <text start="488.679" dur="4.95">meaning or I&amp;#39;m a little off on some of</text>
  <text start="490.689" dur="6.27">the the other stuff I just talked about</text>
  <text start="493.629" dur="6.84">in the vault seven connections to the</text>
  <text start="496.959" dur="11.13">Rainmaker program and Google and North</text>
  <text start="500.469" dur="9.27">Korea so it could all tie in but this</text>
  <text start="508.089" dur="4.95">all ties back to North Korea and North</text>
  <text start="509.739" dur="5.34">Korea basically being disarmed and this</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="3.961">is just kind of the overview so red red</text>
  <text start="515.079" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a red cross it shows up twice I</text>
  <text start="517" dur="5.129">just showed you during that December 4th</text>
  <text start="519.639" dur="4.38">push it was really big so here it all</text>
  <text start="522.129" dur="4.471">here it all is here&amp;#39;s another here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.019" dur="3.841">another version over account of it now</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="3.349">there&amp;#39;s more here there&amp;#39;s two other</text>
  <text start="527.86" dur="3.16">infographics that show a lot about this</text>
  <text start="529.949" dur="4.311">the</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="5.51">is a more in-depth decode with other</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="8.91">stuff pointing to different types of</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="8.95">justice protocols military justice so I</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="4.53">can&amp;#39;t go into all of this but this is I</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="3.57">just want to show this to you you can</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="13.95">pause if you&amp;#39;d like to take a look at it</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="16.2">a lot of stuff I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="5.76">stuff in here and then here&amp;#39;s the last</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="6.24">one or this might have been the first</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="7.44">one but it&amp;#39;s got similar levels of the</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="4.68">same stuff different things point out</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="3.03">two different modifiers on these</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="7.05">stringer codes so this is a very very</text>
  <text start="577.88" dur="6.87">in-depth and this ties into the</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="5.79">Christmas stuff the Christmas pictures</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="5.64">we got on the q and on posts and then</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="2.73">for the most part I mean once that</text>
  <text start="590.39" dur="2.85">infographic was put together I think</text>
  <text start="591.74" dur="3.72">that was on the 14th that was put</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="5.63">together and you know we really haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="595.46" dur="6.99">had any more Keystone stuff pop up so</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="5.11">you see some dates here but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="4.35">because this web page isn&amp;#39;t filtering it</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="4.62">out but that&amp;#39;s really where it stops so</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="3.75">that could have been it you know I could</text>
  <text start="608.6" dur="2.94">totally be off on the other stuff on the</text>
  <text start="610.55" dur="3.51">other stuff I talked about on the</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="4.74">previous videos about tying that</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="3.75">together maybe I was a little hasty and</text>
  <text start="616.28" dur="4.47">putting it together I kind of sat on the</text>
  <text start="617.81" dur="5.64">the video for about 10 days or 14 days</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="4.32">while I was banned so I&amp;#39;m glad we got to</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="5.22">talk about it either way I think I think</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="5.22">this may have a little bit more in since</text>
  <text start="628.67" dur="3.9">it hasn&amp;#39;t really popped up since I</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="4.05">thought I saw it but you know searching</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="3.69">again I haven&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ve kind of moved on</text>
  <text start="634.34" dur="3.87">from there and it points to the North</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="4.19">Korea stuff you know points of them</text>
  <text start="638.21" dur="4.11">being and now they&amp;#39;ve been disarmed and</text>
  <text start="640.45" dur="4.3">I&amp;#39;m just going to stop the video here</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="4.5">before I ramble so I hope you got</text>
  <text start="644.75" dur="5.18">something out of this this is a bill</text>
