  <text start="7.47" dur="4.89">censorship purposes I have had to start</text>
  <text start="9.21" dur="4.83">a new channel so this is kind of just a</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="3.929">way for me to seed some content on my</text>
  <text start="14.04" dur="4.59">channel so that I get you know 10 or 15</text>
  <text start="16.289" dur="3.811">videos up there and I can kind of get</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="3.75">off the race on that second one I</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="5.669">usually focus on queueing on stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="22.38" dur="5.01">really what got me into YouTube actually</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="4.711">the Mueller investigation is what my</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="4.88">first video was on and and then after</text>
  <text start="30.48" dur="4.23">that I started I found queueing on and</text>
  <text start="32.27" dur="4.449">said did that video in December and then</text>
  <text start="34.71" dur="4.38">I found queueing on in mid-january I</text>
  <text start="36.719" dur="4.441">think and then I mean once you find</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="4.5">queueing on stuff it&amp;#39;s fantastic you</text>
  <text start="41.16" dur="4.71">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a road map of really</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="5.09">fun stuff to go dig into and talk about</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="5.04">so pretty much where my focus has been</text>
  <text start="48.68" dur="5.08">well there&amp;#39;s a lot of other stuff that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="5.129">going on online so the conversation</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="4.139">circles out exponentially from there</text>
  <text start="56.039" dur="4.29">just a good place to start so I want to</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="3.361">cover some things especially when it</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="3.501">covered what&amp;#39;s happening to other</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="4.62">youtubers other very popular youtubers</text>

  <text start="71.4" dur="5.27">sense of humor he ridicules people and I</text>
  <text start="74.25" dur="5.369">think that&amp;#39;s the best weapon there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="76.67" dur="5.65">there&amp;#39;s no response to ridicule okay if</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="4.5">you get made fun of and you deserve it</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="6.57">there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do about it so</text>

  <text start="116.399" dur="3.741">the deal is you know so I could watch</text>

  <text start="123.45" dur="8.259">exposes them in this video okay Cheng</text>
  <text start="127.259" dur="7.751">Kyogre is saying trust</text>
  <text start="131.709" dur="4.681">trust the mainstream media and I was</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="3.539">thinking myself you got a YouTube</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="3.54">channel buddy you&amp;#39;re not funded by the</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="2.431">mainstream you could say whatever you</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="3.419">want to say it&amp;#39;s the reason why people</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="5.67">are going to YouTube otherwise you would</text>
  <text start="143.349" dur="5.28">just turn on the TV right there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="5.88">reason why you&amp;#39;re listening to me</text>
  <text start="148.629" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s a reason and you know half the</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="2.549">time it&amp;#39;s total waste of time</text>
  <text start="153.609" dur="5.701">but yes total waste time when you watch</text>
  <text start="155.079" dur="9.27">TV anyway so ah you know up in the air</text>
  <text start="159.31" dur="11.03">well Chang Kyogre has just admitted that</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="11.571">an ex CEO billionaire ex CEO of Billy</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="8.92">billionaire of Disney Jeff Katzenberg</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="4.239">started a new company and just funded</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="7.589">The Young Turks</text>
  <text start="180.159" dur="9">with twenty million dollars part of a 20</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="3.81">million dollar round so they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="189.159" dur="5.78">rounds of investments so I think what</text>
  <text start="190.659" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re gonna do is this is gonna be I</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.12">saw Apple say something in a news</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="3.989">article about how they don&amp;#39;t want to buy</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="4.049">Netflix and they said we would never buy</text>
  <text start="202.419" dur="3.96">Netflix we would just build our own</text>
  <text start="203.889" dur="4.02">Netflix and now you got all these Amazon</text>
  <text start="206.379" dur="4.11">shows I&amp;#39;ve been watching the tick on</text>
  <text start="207.909" dur="7.95">Amazon which is a fantastically funny</text>
  <text start="210.489" dur="7.261">show but the way Silicon Valley works</text>
  <text start="215.859" dur="3.361">and getting these tech startups off the</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="4.53">ground is they do rounds of funding you</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="5.82">do like a seed round or an angel round</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="4.079">then they do a series a which is usually</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="3.689">twenty million dollars and they do a</text>
  <text start="226.359" dur="5.671">series B and then you get up to series D</text>
  <text start="228.729" dur="6.15">and they&amp;#39;re pulling in a billion dollars</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="5.129">of investment money giant giant rounds</text>
  <text start="234.879" dur="4.651">of money so this is when they say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="237.159" dur="4.05">twenty million dollar round they mean</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="3.209">that&amp;#39;s what they mean they don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="241.209" dur="3.631">that investment in this channel The</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="5.75">Young Turks is done they mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="7.139">starting now</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="5.321">again Apple and all these other</text>
  <text start="251.979" dur="4.5">companies are realizing that content is</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="4.799">going to be king now content who can</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="4.5">make the best content those people will</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="4.92">get the most views there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="5.061">people that I mean look at this mark</text>
  <text start="263.529" dur="5.131">Dice 1.2 million views</text>
  <text start="266.04" dur="4.87">about Stephen Colbert it&amp;#39;s a five-minute</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="4.29">video and I&amp;#39;m wondering how many people</text>
  <text start="270.91" dur="3.72">actually tuned in to Stephen Colbert is</text>
  <text start="272.95" dur="6.15">it 1.2 million</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="6.96">I bet it&amp;#39;s probably close so mark Dice</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="4.98">doing a five minute video about Stephen</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="4.8">Colbert is getting at least or close to</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="4.17">the same size of audience that Stephen</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="4.77">Colbert is reaching unlike Comedy</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="4.98">Central on TV these main channels so</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s really really important</text>
  <text start="293.23" dur="7.49">that they start shutting down YouTube</text>
  <text start="296.08" dur="6.81">because no one enjoys leftist content</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="4.6">nobody likes it they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.89" dur="5.37">like it people don&amp;#39;t share it people</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t talk about it it&amp;#39;s not funny it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s not funny and that&amp;#39;s the reason why</text>
  <text start="310.54" dur="2.94">all these ratings are crashing on TV</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="9.51">it&amp;#39;s because people don&amp;#39;t want to watch</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="11.04">it it&amp;#39;s not funny so interesting times</text>
  <text start="321.79" dur="7.2">that we live in the Young Turks just got</text>
  <text start="324.52" dur="8.57">twenty million dollars in one round of</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="9.06">investment from a billionaire ex-ceo</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="6.55">billionaire ex CEO of Disney and then</text>
