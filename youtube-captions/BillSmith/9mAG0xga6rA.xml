  <text start="2.03" dur="5.05">there&amp;#39;s been some breaking Q news so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5.43" dur="4.11">gonna cover it tonight before I go to</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="5.099">sleep and then I&amp;#39;ll cover some more</text>
  <text start="9.54" dur="5.91">stuff that happens tomorrow related to</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="3.781">it so first of all today is the 26th of</text>
  <text start="15.45" dur="4.409">June</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s like 10:45 p.m. and there has been</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="4.441">an incident with a plane so a plane was</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="4.92">landed they&amp;#39;re not sure exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.3" dur="4.2">happened yet there isn&amp;#39;t a lot of news</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s been released or official</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="4.079">statements or anything so I&amp;#39;ll just read</text>
  <text start="30.84" dur="6.3">over the post and then we&amp;#39;ll go look at</text>
  <text start="32.579" dur="7.261">it so post 1588 says coincidence review</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="6.78">the images and location nothing provided</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="7.8">is random it was San Francisco to JFK it</text>
  <text start="43.92" dur="8.49">was an air flight a three to one</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="6.18">it was a direct flight no sign Q okay so</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="2.46">that was what I was just mentioning and</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;ll go to Twitter here and look at</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="5.939">some links here in a second but this is</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="7.641">the coverage so Q replies then he says</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="9.121">signal sent attempts still made averted</text>
  <text start="66.11" dur="5.74">so I think that&amp;#39;s like a jamming device</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="4.229">I think I read that somewhere</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="4.29">so signals sent attempt was still made</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="4.831">and it was averted so I guess maybe they</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="5.58">were able to land the plane even though</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="5.879">there was a signal jammed the story is</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="9.719">that the plane lost communications with</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="8.311">a tower so it&amp;#39;s a continuous says do you</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="3.39">believe it&amp;#39;s coincidence extreme</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="3.75">rhetoric is being pushed while at the</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="6.54">same time rod Rosenstein is on the brink</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="7.35">of collapse define so rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="4.951">must either comply with all the document</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="4.26">demands or face impeachment</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.71">either way it&amp;#39;s a 2-way failure if he</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="4.98">complies he fails there&amp;#39;s self</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="5.4">implication and a known conflict which</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.62">is why he was why he sailed through the</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="4.729">nomination process why he was selected</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="3.019">in the first place okay</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="4.29">if he fails to comply though he gets</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="6.54">impeached and he gets removed so why has</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="5.15">there not been DOJ text disclosed to the</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="4.131">public</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="4.8">so rod Rosenstein to Loretta Lynch will</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="5.37">read a lunch to Hillary Clinton and then</text>
  <text start="136.55" dur="5.58">to people somebody to somebody okay so</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="5.37">it talks about I think James Comey to</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="7.17">Loretta Lynch and 247 times and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.1" dur="7.44">relevant I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s 24/7 or if</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="6.08">it&amp;#39;s 247 times it could be that they</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="6.33">communicated 247 times directly</text>
  <text start="155.38" dur="4.42">so it says Loretta Lynch is key okay so</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="3.09">to move on</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;ll just get over this quick because</text>
  <text start="161.96" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s a lot here it says where are the</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="6.54">JC a.m. text messages Gmail messages</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="6.69">burner phone messages the call poles</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="5.13">coming soon to a theater near you so</text>
  <text start="175.31" dur="4.47">generally they drop that in there to get</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="4.59">us excited PS LP techs are only</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="3.36">scratching the surface threat of</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="4.59">assassination they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="8.13">this by activating progressive activists</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="7.8">redline my worry about the threats of</text>
  <text start="191.27" dur="3.72">assassination is it&amp;#39;s gonna be some kind</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="5.3">of like tongue-in-cheek thing that they</text>
  <text start="194.99" dur="7.23">can just easily explain away so I&amp;#39;m uh</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="7.36">you know I&amp;#39;m not too excited about that</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="5.28">I wasn&amp;#39;t also excited about remember he</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="2.85">was supposed to be in Peach last Friday</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="4.11">what happened to that remember that</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="4.77">popped up out of nowhere it got posted</text>
  <text start="211.61" dur="6.21">to on the queue and on board from Lisa</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="5.849">May to the IE political i-17 guy</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="3.57">remember how they kind of made it seem</text>
  <text start="219.769" dur="5.881">like rod Rosenstein was gonna get</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="5.76">impeached on Friday did that happen you</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="4.11">know you got to ask yourself what was</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="3.96">the point of all that because then we</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.78">started talking about her pedophile ring</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="4.05">and it was kind of old news I think so I</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="3.24">did a video about it I covered the news</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="2.9">because it was on the queue pose but at</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="4.14">the same time would that do for us</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="5.41">nothing I got people excited about</text>
  <text start="240.92" dur="4.62">Friday and it didn&amp;#39;t happen so remember</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="6.03">the channel of people that provided that</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="5.82">information just remember that so it</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="2.85">says once the documents are supplied of</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="3.629">you by the Senate and congressional</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="5.129">leaders and the public they lose to set</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="5.641">up a scam fice abuse executive powers</text>
  <text start="257.479" dur="4.951">legal spying frame insertion of assets</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="3.12">so they&amp;#39;re gonna try to prevent it at</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="2.76">all cost the traitors</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="4.29">the traitors are</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="4.59">they and they know that we know but</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="5.13">until the public knows it is contained</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="5.1">that people have the power I have been</text>
  <text start="273.17" dur="4.08">saying this for months unless my dad</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.37">knows unless the TV tells my dad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="4.59">not real to the American public because</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="5.52">my dad at this point is a shade of</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="6">purple you know he was deep blue about a</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="3.72">year and a half ago two years ago but</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="2.97">after I think Trump&amp;#39;s been warming up</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="3.3">with some good stuff I think he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="4.17">surprised so he&amp;#39;s starting to turn a</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="4.5">shade of purple but there ain&amp;#39;t no way</text>
  <text start="294.98" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s ever gonna go red you know and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="297.29" dur="3.3">not even sure this has got to be a party</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="3.42">thing anymore Democrats versus</text>
  <text start="300.59" dur="4.43">Republicans I don&amp;#39;t want to boil the</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="6.06">conversation out of that I think that</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="5.17">having options is a good thing but you</text>
  <text start="308.18" dur="2.55">know we need to get this thing handled</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="5.28">man</text>
  <text start="310.73" dur="8.1">there&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re getting destroyed you know</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="5.34">let&amp;#39;s handle it my worry is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.01">not gonna show up until September so</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re gonna bust some stuff loose July</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="3.91">hopefully which I&amp;#39;ll talk about in a</text>
  <text start="325.1" dur="5.37">second but I think September is going to</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="6.69">be the big breakthrough late September</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="4.89">early October you&amp;#39;re gonna see a big pop</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="4.17">probably because it&amp;#39;s going to be a gear</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="5.16">up for the midterm elections and I think</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s difficult to keep the news cycle</text>
  <text start="340.52" dur="6.6">active for more than like six weeks from</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="4.17">just what I know you know and I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="4.14">pro or anything I just think six weeks</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="4.95">is kind of like the that&amp;#39;s the end push</text>
  <text start="351.26" dur="5.13">so expect to see a lot more stuff like</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="5.52">inset into September early October if</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="4.98">anything my worry though man is that we</text>
  <text start="359.54" dur="3.06">haven&amp;#39;t seen anybody do a perp walk</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="5.64">I know people wouldn&amp;#39;t call him for that</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="7.89">for a long time but we&amp;#39;ve really gotten</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="4.49">nothing nothing of substantial value out</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="3.24">in the open</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="4.54">you know we had Adam Schiff at the</text>
  <text start="373.73" dur="4.5">standard hotel covering up helicopter</text>
  <text start="376.04" dur="4.56">accidents that was like you know what</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="4.98">three four months ago whatever happened</text>
  <text start="380.6" dur="4.5">with that whatever happened with Syria</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="3.39">you know what&amp;#39;s going on in North Korea</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s all kinds of stuff we</text>
  <text start="386.6" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m tired of chasing you know I want</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="4.29">something real to happen so we can talk</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.65">about it my point being is that even</text>
  <text start="394.7" dur="3.779">once they have their congressional</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="2.25">hearings and the stuff comes out in the</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="3.391">open</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="4.559">so what they still haven&amp;#39;t tried anybody</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="4.289">and maybe they do have a bunch of sealed</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="4.951">indictments but that&amp;#39;s gonna take a huge</text>
  <text start="406.159" dur="5.13">amount of time to push it push the room</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="4.979">more so unless there maybe the plan is</text>
  <text start="411.289" dur="6.541">this maybe the plan is use the first two</text>
  <text start="413.569" dur="6.121">years okay to secure the midterms pop it</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="8.579">right at the midterms and then use the</text>
  <text start="419.69" dur="9.21">second two years to start trying people</text>
  <text start="426.409" dur="5.521">in the public you know air out the dirty</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="5.79">laundry and then use that to secure a</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="4.079">second term for Trump and the second</text>
  <text start="434.69" dur="3.39">term is probably gonna be what all the</text>
  <text start="436.009" dur="3.331">magic happens because he&amp;#39;s not facing</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="2.88">re-election and he really doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="4.139">to worry about keeping control of stuff</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="6.72">it could just be you know mow that mow</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="6.03">it all over so I see the differences</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="3.449">here I see how it could be one thing</text>
  <text start="449.509" dur="2.91">versus the other I understand the</text>
  <text start="451.129" dur="3.75">timeline but I want to see some more</text>
  <text start="452.419" dur="6.75">stuff you know I&amp;#39;m saying okay so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.879" dur="5.1">get through the rest of this so the</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="4.321">people have the power</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="8.19">MSM will portray progressive activists</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="7.56">as a large part of the population this</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="4.8">is false no possibility of compromise do</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="4.19">not underestimate our resolve we stand</text>
  <text start="472.969" dur="7.23">at the ready okay so you know some</text>
  <text start="475.24" dur="6.76">antipholus ain&amp;#39;t gonna do much so fails</text>
  <text start="480.199" dur="3.96">this was a misspelling we saw this like</text>
  <text start="482" dur="3.69">twice cues posted from a mobile phone</text>
  <text start="484.159" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s why everything points to mobile</text>
  <text start="485.69" dur="5.46">Twitter so I don&amp;#39;t know me and I really</text>
  <text start="489.199" dur="4.741">think that I would like to see them take</text>
  <text start="491.15" dur="4.68">this more seriously just that&amp;#39;s just me</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="4.08">I think that this should warrant you</text>
  <text start="495.83" dur="4.35">doing this from a desktop or a laptop</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="3.899">computer you should be checking this for</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="4.65">you should be checking your post five or</text>
  <text start="501.919" dur="4.05">six times before you post anything to</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="2.67">this board there&amp;#39;s millions of people</text>

  <text start="507.5" dur="6.779">so stop being stupid Q and on that&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="512.329" dur="5.971">spelling mistakes and less than a few</text>
  <text start="514.279" dur="5.851">posts so I think you need to bring some</text>
