  <text start="10.17" dur="4.16">day looking through this stuff there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="5.579">some extremely interesting things about</text>
  <text start="14.33" dur="3.64">the founder of the school draining the</text>
  <text start="17.369" dur="3.181">swamp</text>

  <text start="26.91" dur="3.689">it bothered me a little bit it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="2.91">you know like it just kind of stuck with</text>
  <text start="30.599" dur="4.171">me I don&amp;#39;t know why he would spell it</text>
  <text start="32.16" dur="6.329">out this way but he responds Q responds</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="8.57">to his own post right and it says</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="6.241">discoveries must be Ori G organically</text>
  <text start="43.34" dur="4.69">hivemind</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="5.46">Q so my first inkling and I bet</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="5.939">everybody else thought this was it needs</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="6.45">to be originally organic but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="5.041">what he says so if we take that first</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="3.36">statement okay it could just be that</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re not gonna find what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="60" dur="6.479">looking for online it&amp;#39;s gonna be in some</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="6.15">backup file somewhere and the only way</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="5.581">to get to this stuff is maybe to find</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="6.12">people who have access to you know the</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="5.25">actual file systems on-site at some of</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="5.219">these hospitals that did the psychiatric</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="8.21">treatments for these school shooters and</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="6.991">I imagine that&amp;#39;s one huge meaning and I</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="4.09">encourage everyone to go down that route</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="4.049">all right but I&amp;#39;m gonna propose</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="4.71">something separate that I think it might</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="4.291">point to now he spells this stuff out</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="3.54">really weird and he talks about how a</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="2.22">lot of the stuff he says has double</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="2.88">meanings</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="3.87">he also says how he can&amp;#39;t just come out</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="3.57">and say stuff because he has to get</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="4.41">around the sniffers he doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="4.199">get shut down he&amp;#39;d like to have his post</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="3.12">be up there so they can be discussed he</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="3.331">doesn&amp;#39;t want to take that take the</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.17">chance down so they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="4.169">the communications open so a lot of this</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="4.46">stuff is coated some of it is you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="7.5">seen some coated stuff already I imagine</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="7.779">but why did he spell it out this way so</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="7.261">I&amp;#39;m I mentioned earlier that these ori g</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="7.651">files basically point to like backups so</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="6.99">an extension usually containing backup</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="6.39">and right now he says archive everything</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.8">offline that you can find because once</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="4.65">you find it and they see you find it</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s possible these people don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.77">know like the bad guys the black hats</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="4.5">the deep state it&amp;#39;s possible that they</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t even know the extent of where all</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="5.25">this informations at I mean the Internet</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="4.74">is a is a wild place to be so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="3.93">discounting that it could possibly mean</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="6.15">that and I think people should really</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="6.51">track down what this oor IG means in</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="5.16">comparison to the school shootings I bet</text>

  <text start="534.63" dur="7.53">as stoked market outrage it gets real</text>
  <text start="540.33" dur="3.78">bad I mean shares in the company are</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="4.86">currently trading at four dollars and</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="5.84">sixty-two cents back in April the share</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="5.91">price peaked at a close of over two</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.08">thousand dollars so this looks like a</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="3.75">giant pump and dump scheme in order to</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="3.42">free up a bunch of cash that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="556.68" dur="4.05">looks like to me and the fact that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="4.74">run through a Cayman Islands shell</text>
  <text start="560.73" dur="5.49">company is even more suspicious and the</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="5.91">fact that this happens right after Trump</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="5.07">takes office okay literally okay Trump</text>
  <text start="569.1" dur="5.22">takes office and then and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.29" dur="6.3">going you know they it&amp;#39;s a pump and dump</text>
  <text start="574.32" dur="4.62">scheme and I think maybe she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="577.59" dur="4.47">that this is an April this is before</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="5.28">Trump took office okay so I could have</text>
  <text start="582.06" dur="3.69">my numbers wrong I&amp;#39;d appreciate it if</text>
  <text start="584.22" dur="3.93">somebody else would correct some of this</text>
  <text start="585.75" dur="4.08">stuff in the comments if I&amp;#39;m often but</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re gonna look closely at the rest of</text>
  <text start="589.83" dur="4.89">this article this basically just shows</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="4.11">you how dirty this guy is okay I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="594.72" dur="4.35">look at the last paragraph here it says</text>
  <text start="596.52" dur="4.83">multiple reverse share splits like this</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="3.96">are very rare the first three of these</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="5.43">transactions took the numbers of Drs</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="4.14">shares from 700 million to just 1.1</text>
  <text start="606.78" dur="2.16">million</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="4.02">this means that shareholders were unable</text>
  <text start="608.94" dur="5.19">to benefit from small share price</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="6.87">movements and then following each</text>
  <text start="614.13" dur="6.51">reverse split transaction economy sold</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="7.14">shares back into the market the result</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="6.66">share dilution and the result was that</text>
  <text start="625.2" dur="5.1">there was share dilution and a reduction</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="5.49">of values for its shareholders so it</text>
  <text start="630.3" dur="6.72">goes to $2,000 now it&amp;#39;s at 4 bucks it</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="6.99">was a pump and dump scheme then then</text>
  <text start="637.02" dur="5.28">okay this guy started defaulting on</text>
  <text start="639.78" dur="5.91">these giant loan payments of 280 million</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="5.16">dollars and the crazy part is is that</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="5.34">this guy took these loan payments out of</text>
  <text start="647.46" dur="7.2">83 million dollars right 334 million</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="8.97">total and bought other companies that he</text>
  <text start="654.66" dur="8.1">controlled it I mean I don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
