  <text start="318.66" dur="7.65">WikiLeaks are they compromised</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="6.04">big-time they were bought out and comped</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="4.56">they detest queue Intel they pretend to</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="3.99">fight for Julian Assange&amp;#39;s freedom while</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="4.77">milking money out of dupes so like I</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.94">said if you&amp;#39;re sending WikiLeaks money</text>

  <text start="339" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t have the background on it I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="341.73" dur="3.57">super familiar with this but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="4.05">hearing rumors since 2016 that they were</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="4.83">they were pretty much taken over and</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="3.18">Julian was pushed out so don&amp;#39;t send the</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="2.67">money</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s better people to donate to if</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s what you want to do they said</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="3.48">when was the last time they leaked</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="4.32">actual Intel it&amp;#39;s kind of weird that</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="5.81">this comments here because today they</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="8.13">quote-unquote leaked the Tommy Robinson</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="6.19">sentencing documents which whatever you</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="5.7">know that&amp;#39;s not really we know where</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="7.56">he&amp;#39;s at he&amp;#39;s in prison so not a lot of</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="6.39">value there all right so he talks about</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="4.53">the lawyer was the lawyers tweet and</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="4.95">reference to back-channel 17 was that</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="5.16">false is she in on it and this account</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="5.79">says false information yes but false</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="5.04">intent it&amp;#39;s impossible to say this she</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="3.06">doesn&amp;#39;t even understand the scope of</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s happening the team has kept at a</text>
  <text start="395.13" dur="3.99">distance there&amp;#39;s no visitors no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="1.95">had contact with Julian in like two</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="2.07">months</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="2.94">right so no</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="3.66">but he can prove he was in the embassy</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="5.43">or not yesterday it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="5.82">that by all intents and purposes it</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="4.95">looks like Julian is already across the</text>
  <text start="410.67" dur="3.54">ocean somewhere in the United States it</text>
  <text start="412.89" dur="5.7">looks like he&amp;#39;s in some kind of like</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="5.82">military security bunker possibly I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="5.67">just guessing from the picture that was</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="7.47">up earlier that was taken down this next</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="5.6">question was about the booms so any info</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="5.57">on the mysterious booms around the world</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="6.64">so it says which ones have been a few</text>
  <text start="433.07" dur="5.77">so the joderic was like are they not all</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="4.2">connected are they man-made and the</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="3.9">answer was most or man-made there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="440.7" dur="4.68">few different reasons some is</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="4.89">geophysical warfare being practiced some</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="5.4">is upper atmosphere play being done the</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="4.71">by the HAARP scientists and some belongs</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="5.48">to things so literally out of this world</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="3.92">you would think me crazy for saying it I</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="6.64">don&amp;#39;t know what that last part means</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="8.14">they won&amp;#39;t come out and say it okay</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="5.97">but somebody mentioned UFOs I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="3.33">it could be that kinetic stuff that</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="4.32">kinetic warfare those tungsten rods they</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="4.35">have the the rods of God up in the</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="3.92">satellite systems where they it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="4.32">nuclear payload without the fallout</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="4">kinetic warfare that would make sense I</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="3.15">think that&amp;#39;s what I don&amp;#39;t know this for</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="3.6">sure but maybe that&amp;#39;s what took out the</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="6.78">North Korean mountain bunker</text>
  <text start="485.31" dur="7.62">just a guess I don&amp;#39;t know next question</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.67">was will we know the sins of the past as</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.89">far as JFK goes John F Kennedy and the</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="4.98">Franklin cover-up things like that the</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="5.42">answer was yes and very soon this is</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="7.53">interesting to me because I watched I</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="8.08">watched the JFK assassination movie with</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="5.34">Kevin Costner back in the 90s I was</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="4.74">super excited I knew I&amp;#39;d be old when it</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="4.32">came out and if you remember Trump</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="4.349">released some of it but he held some of</text>
  <text start="517.71" dur="5.519">it back and I think in those documents</text>
  <text start="520.409" dur="5.221">it talked about Oswald being connected</text>
  <text start="523.229" dur="5.191">with the CIA</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="6.27">interesting stuff just remember daddy</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="5.58">Bush the chef&amp;#39;s they were involved with</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="2.68">the CIA back then I think he was the</text>
  <text start="534" dur="5.53">director</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="7.49">the time of the JFK assassination next</text>
  <text start="539.53" dur="5.34">question from the same guy Joe Dirt</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="5.26">we&amp;#39;ll all info on corruption and evil</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="5.34">deeds be accessible by the public who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="570.46" dur="3.42">but he says bennewitz wasn&amp;#39;t crazy there</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="5.85">are things out there that would curl</text>

  <text start="597.31" dur="4.89">end of the quote witch-hunt it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="599.11" dur="4.47">be a big speech thing from Assange about</text>
  <text start="602.2" dur="3.3">Russia and the Hillary Rodham Clinton</text>
  <text start="603.58" dur="7.05">stuff it&amp;#39;s going to be good bring your</text>

  <text start="610.63" dur="5.7">this a little bit it looks like john</text>
  <text start="613.15" dur="4.35">bolton i think that&amp;#39;s his name he&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="616.33" dur="3.63">seems pretty deep state I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="4.26">what Trump was doing picking him but</text>
  <text start="619.96" dur="3.72">this guy tried to derail the talks he</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="4.83">tried to basically threaten the North</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="5.97">Korea leadership with the quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="5.28">Libya treatment and people took that as</text>
  <text start="629.65" dur="4.08">like we&amp;#39;re gonna you gave up your nukes</text>
  <text start="631.87" dur="3.78">and we lift the sanctions but then pence</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="3.78">came out and clarified it he&amp;#39;s like no</text>

  <text start="642.61" dur="3.9">treat that guy with respect and for all</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="3.39">intents it looks like Gadhafi was</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="5.51">actually a pretty good leader for Libya</text>
  <text start="648.25" dur="7.32">so that scared North Korea out and then</text>
  <text start="652.02" dur="5.71">and then the talks were back on so I</text>
