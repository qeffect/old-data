  <text start="2.49" dur="4.32">could have access to but has not so</text>
  <text start="5.279" dur="4.891">you&amp;#39;ve seen it I&amp;#39;ve seen it I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="6.81" dur="6.15">not only the memo and the basis of the</text>
  <text start="10.17" dur="5.09">memo but the underlying documents and</text>
  <text start="12.96" dur="4.59">what they&amp;#39;re putting forth is a total</text>
  <text start="15.26" dur="4.599">misrepresentation it is false and</text>
  <text start="17.55" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re putting it out there as if it is</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="4.021">factual and then saying we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="21.9" dur="3.209">show this to the American people but</text>
  <text start="23.88" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re not going to show the rebut</text>
  <text start="25.109" dur="4.68">rebuttal to it by the Democrats now the</text>
  <text start="27.06" dur="4.799">Democrats have said rightfully we</text>
  <text start="29.789" dur="5.04">shouldn&amp;#39;t be putting anything out unless</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="5.011">it has been reviewed and redacted by the</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="3.811">intelligence the appropriate they say</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="4.5">they don&amp;#39;t want the DOJ to look at it</text>
  <text start="38.64" dur="4.32">because they are part of their concerns</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="3.54">about how things were done during the</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="4.02">campaign Jay is only one part of the</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="4.649">intelligence community the intelligence</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="7.59">community is best it&amp;#39;s the CIA the DNA a</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="7.441">DNI the National Defense everybody has</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="4.05">their element of it and sources and</text>
  <text start="57" dur="4.26">methods must be protected but not only</text>
  <text start="58.62" dur="5.04">that I can&amp;#39;t even reference some words</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="4.5">that are in it because that would be a</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="4.74">violation of the confidentiality of the</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="5.609">classified nature so this again putting</text>
  <text start="68.4" dur="5.1">this aside in terms of tit-for-tat what</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="3.451">you seem - well with all due respect to</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="3.119">you it was trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="3.93">Democrats versus it isn&amp;#39;t about that</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="3.421">it&amp;#39;s about our national security and our</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="3.63">president United States is the</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="3.509">commander-in-chief and he should stop</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="3.48">this immediately</text>
  <text start="83.549" dur="5.041">I should stop think he&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.439">release the memo he says he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="3.779">he hadn&amp;#39;t even probably seen it but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="4.14">gonna release it and in fact he should</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="4.971">be saying if no release should ever</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="5.761">happen without the agencies of the</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="5.5">intelligence community reviewing and</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="4.62">redacting from public review who&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="5.34">to share intelligence with us if they</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="5.31">think it&amp;#39;s up to newness not even</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="3.329">reading the stuff and release you put a</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="3.029">lot of this on newness but that means</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="3.961">you put it on Ryan that&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="4.111">speaker picked do you blame Paul Ryan</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="3.66">for Michael I think that he has a major</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.47">responsibility and what I call a</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.279">cover-up of what they are doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="4.559">really very sad but again it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="3.811">cover-up also it&amp;#39;s a distraction</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.861">what really we are trying to do right</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="5.01">now is keep government open they have a</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="4.469">problem with that because there</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="3.27">effective and you think they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="135.629" dur="2.131">this because they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="3.09">government to be open but I think</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re do whatever they do is a</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="3.78">distraction so what you never know what</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="2.941">that&amp;#39;s what they say so help me</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="4.05">understand this I know you can&amp;#39;t reveal</text>

  <text start="183.569" dur="4.2">holy grail of the truth about what was</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="3.33">happening during the campaign and it</text>
  <text start="187.769" dur="4.47">points the finger at the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.37">the FBI well let me just say this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.239" dur="3.901">not going to become them the Republicans</text>

  <text start="196.14" dur="4.74">in this regard we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="4.259">intelligence community we&amp;#39;re not talking</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.199">about some issue that were having a</text>

  <text start="213.72" dur="5.91">this isn&amp;#39;t to not to be politicized this</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="5.699">is about fact it&amp;#39;s about evidence about</text>
  <text start="219.63" dur="6.03">data it&amp;#39;s not about making up a false</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="5.611">memo based on a false premise that the</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="5.37">Chairman hasn&amp;#39;t even read and then to</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="5.669">put it out like he hasn&amp;#39;t read it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="4.829">a problem we&amp;#39;ll take we&amp;#39;ll take how can</text>
  <text start="233.849" dur="3.871">you decide if you haven&amp;#39;t read it that</text>
  <text start="235.859" dur="3.06">it should be revealed to the Americans</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="3.18">your point but what I&amp;#39;m saying is this</text>
  <text start="238.919" dur="4.261">are you saying without revealing</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.35">anything that&amp;#39;s confident obviously I</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t do it I get it but you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="3.93">that if the American people see this</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.32">memo and they read it and they think</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="3.779">about it that they could not reasonably</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="3.45">conclude that there was any problem with</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="3.481">what happened during the election of</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="3.839">course not the well then why are they so</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="4.44">anxious to release it because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="5.671">even true it&amp;#39;s not even true they have</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="4.92">made up a memo that isn&amp;#39;t even true and</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="2.71">they&amp;#39;re lying to the American so what</text>

  <text start="266.65" dur="4.41">well we we have put forth a memo which</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="3.989">we reluctantly did but said don&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="3.48">this on unless it is reviewed and</text>
  <text start="272.979" dur="3.481">redacted that now won&amp;#39;t be out when</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="3.9">theirs is out doesn&amp;#39;t that tell you</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="3.929">something the Republicans say we want</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="3.36">the American people to see our memo but</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="3.421">we&amp;#39;re voting against showing the</text>
  <text start="281.8" dur="4.47">American people the Democratic memo but</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="4.169">again let&amp;#39;s enlarge this issue this let</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.2">me not get engaged in this Republican</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="5.521">Democratic thing this is about security</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.1">or not it&amp;#39;s about people in our country</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="2.43">who work so hard to protect the American</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="2.22">people</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="5.37">in the intelligence community and to be</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="5.7">frivolous with their identity or roads</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="3.57">that can lose to lead to them about</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="4.799">you&amp;#39;re saying that you think it puts</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.07">lives at stake intelligence that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="3.031">necessary for other countries to share</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="3.09">with us why would they put it at the</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="3.42">mercy of Dennis Nunez who doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="3.81">remember and say the American people</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="4.47">should see it and the American people</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="4.62">with that they have their own jobs to do</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re saying now I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="3.54">to redact a memo because I know what is</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="3.18">true I know what is false no I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="325" dur="2.99">you guys redact what you need to redact</text>
  <text start="326.68" dur="4.169">but then let the American people decide</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="5.38">but they that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not the way</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="4.801">intelligence works you that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="3.99">way it works it&amp;#39;s not a court this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="3.66">a subject of that what&amp;#39;s in the tax bill</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="3.69">or what&amp;#39;s not in the tax bill this is a</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="5.22">question of what is important to our</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="7.79">national security to be secure so and</text>
