  <text start="285.39" dur="3.3">like 2,000 Dutch and - and they were</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="4.44">able to go round up 2,000 people from</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="5.91">these outer areas and bring them down</text>
  <text start="291.39" dur="6.66">here to do it so 2,000 Dutch got</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="5.07">together 2,000 South Africans from up</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.619">here who were scattered I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="306.72" dur="5.46">specifics about it but they brought them</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="5.73">down here and started a civilization in</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="3.6">a culture that&amp;#39;s what happened there was</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="3.33">no one living down here in South Africa</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="3.87">so I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know when people say</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="3.84">hey you know you you got to give us this</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="3.15">land back cuz you know you colonized it</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="4.11">and we were here first</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="5.76">there was 2,000 Dutch down there and</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="4.68">there was only 2,000 people that they</text>
  <text start="328.56" dur="10.56">could dig up out here you know in the</text>
  <text start="330.54" dur="10.02">continent so hardcore okay so we all</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="3.81">know the deal at this point you know the</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.85">deal is to overrun with these people</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="4.92">right in an unsafe area because certain</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="4.71">people live there we&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="347.85" dur="5.16">overrun Europe that&amp;#39;s the name of the</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="7.59">game with as many people as possible</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="9.78">and now Eastern Bloc so anybody that was</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.67">under communism or close to it right</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="3.84">understands the name of the game that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="5.19">still fresh for them so Estonia Latvia</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5">Lithuania Belarus Ukraine like they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="380.49" dur="7.56">controlled this huge route forward</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="7.12">Serbia and Bulgaria Kosovo this is the</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="4.52">old Yugoslavia this area and nobody</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="4.05">wants to live there I mean it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="392.57" dur="4.51">it&amp;#39;s a crap hole it&amp;#39;s really Muslim it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="5.25">like we&amp;#39;re Muslim Muslim culture and</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="4.809">white culture kind of overlap I mean</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="3.369">honestly most of us</text>
  <text start="401.889" dur="5.821">I think if we trace our roots most of us</text>

  <text start="444.129" dur="5.431">anymore understand that we are not these</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="6">people everything that we did okay if</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="5.31">your great-great-great grandparents were</text>
  <text start="451.84" dur="7.439">slaves or if they emigrated in the early</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="6.12">1900&amp;#39;s or before then you know all</text>
  <text start="459.279" dur="4.521">across the board man that is who you are</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="7.76">here and we came over here to do some</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="9.639">better living you know voting rights a</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="6.159">balance of government a fair court</text>
  <text start="473.439" dur="3.69">system you know hopefully people that</text>
  <text start="474.909" dur="3.57">write good laws stuff like that now we</text>
  <text start="477.129" dur="4.5">got a good president it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.479" dur="6.69">taking back over so I want I want things</text>
  <text start="481.629" dur="8.13">you know and the more that I look at it</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="6.36">you know this is the problem for me as</text>
  <text start="489.759" dur="4.701">this little strip of land right here</text>
  <text start="491.529" dur="6.95">it&amp;#39;s super hotly contested for reasons</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="7.12">now I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with</text>
  <text start="498.479" dur="4.75">individuals in the world you know like</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="3.109">you don&amp;#39;t get to choose what life you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="3.87">born into me and that&amp;#39;s not your choice</text>
  <text start="504.689" dur="4.54">how are you how are you supposed how you</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="5.971">can&amp;#39;t control that you can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="5.841">that okay but at this point we are not</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="5.849">these people okay</text>
  <text start="515.07" dur="8.769">Israel is not the United States and all</text>
  <text start="518.919" dur="6.721">of the Jewish people most of them okay</text>
  <text start="523.839" dur="3.631">in the United States anybody in media</text>
  <text start="525.64" dur="4.319">anybody that you&amp;#39;re gonna know about any</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="3.989">name is gonna be pro-israel a hundred</text>
  <text start="529.959" dur="4.94">percent and I just don&amp;#39;t understand it</text>
  <text start="531.459" dur="3.44">they&amp;#39;re the seat of so many problems</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="10.62">so if you&amp;#39;re Jewish and you&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="6.44">the United States you can be on our team</text>
  <text start="547.48" dur="5.44">do you get that you can be on our team</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="5.1">you can be on Team United States that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="6.42">what we are we&amp;#39;re all Patriots here but</text>
  <text start="555.95" dur="7.53">you need to ask yourself are you on Team</text>
  <text start="559.34" dur="8.34">United States or do you have dual</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="6.56">citizenship to another country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="4.83">really small and needs to be protected</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="7.12">you know in a hotly contested area of</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="9.63">the world which is built on essentially</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="7.68">some shaky dealings and this leads me</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="4.83">into this point okay the reason why</text>
  <text start="584.84" dur="8.22">people have to protect Israel so hard in</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="10.68">the media just listen carefully the</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="8.27">reason why Israel has to defend its</text>
  <text start="597.65" dur="7.16">quote/unquote right to exist</text>
  <text start="601.33" dur="8.41">frequently constantly and ferociously is</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="8.68">because they don&amp;#39;t have a right to exist</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.67">and that&amp;#39;s my best guess</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="4.71">otherwise they wouldn&amp;#39;t be saying what</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="4.86">they say constantly it&amp;#39;s the only place</text>
  <text start="618.2" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;ve ever heard it it&amp;#39;s just odd it</text>
  <text start="620.27" dur="3.93">sticks out to me do you don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="621.71" dur="5.82">Jordan Jordanians going we need to</text>
  <text start="624.2" dur="4.74">defend our right to exist you know it</text>
  <text start="627.53" dur="3.33">doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t happen you know here</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="6.09">you don&amp;#39;t hear Syrians go look we got to</text>
  <text start="630.86" dur="6.33">defend our right to exist to Syria you</text>
  <text start="635.03" dur="5.82">know they have to defend their country</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="8.37">that&amp;#39;s for sure but no one ever says</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="8.19">that no one ever says look let me make</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="7.29">it really clear no one ever says we go</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="7.88">up here you don&amp;#39;t hear French people</text>
  <text start="652.85" dur="4.07">going France has a right to exist</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="7.03">you don&amp;#39;t hear it like why why would you</text>
  <text start="660.69" dur="5.58">not hear French people say that you know</text>
