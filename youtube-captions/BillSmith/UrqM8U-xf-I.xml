  <text start="6.99" dur="6.42">a band called Linkin Park the other lead</text>
  <text start="10.29" dur="5.88">singer Chester Bennington died under</text>
  <text start="13.41" dur="6.27">mysterious circumstances last July on</text>
  <text start="16.17" dur="5.519">the heels of another mysterious death in</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="5.49">his best friend at the time Chris</text>
  <text start="21.689" dur="5.67">Cornell Chris Cornell was the lead</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="3.33">singer of another band and the 90s</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="4.021">called Soundgarden which had just</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="4.23">recently touring again so I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="2.64">go into either one of those two deaths</text>
  <text start="32.73" dur="4.919">just that this is linked in that</text>
  <text start="34.02" dur="5.34">direction now Mike Shinoda is active on</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="4.261">Twitter obviously he&amp;#39;s got a million</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="4.26">Twitter followers and the first thing</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="5.52">that I noticed I&amp;#39;ve never looked at Mike</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="7.86">Shinoda before but the first thing I</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="5.84">noticed is his logo with what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.59">right now why would you leave that up</text>
  <text start="53.27" dur="4.449">now I don&amp;#39;t want to go into this too</text>
  <text start="56.07" dur="4.07">deep I imagine I&amp;#39;m missing something</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s probably like a Lincoln Park logo</text>
  <text start="60.14" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s probably widely used I would</text>
  <text start="62.879" dur="5.971">imagine</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="10">but either way what do you see in that</text>
  <text start="68.85" dur="8.67">logo what I see is - is a little baby</text>
  <text start="74.25" dur="5.97">triangle inside a bigger triangle inside</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="6.72">of a hexagon and they do it artistically</text>

  <text start="85.56" dur="5.19">mean well most of you already know this</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="7.049">but the little triangle inside the</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="7.979">triangle is this boy love logo which I</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="5.79">absolutely detest and it has to do with</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="3.901">this organization called NAMBLA which is</text>

  <text start="379.59" dur="7.16">very interesting now if you want to take</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="8.789">the next steps you can go look at this</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="7.719">this talks about Chester Bennington</text>
  <text start="392.309" dur="4.02">being a child abuse victim being best</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="4.11">friends with Chris Cornell who was</text>
  <text start="396.329" dur="4.05">allegedly investigating comet ping-pong</text>
  <text start="398.579" dur="3.48">I doubt he was investigating comet</text>
  <text start="400.379" dur="3.69">ping-pong I think he was probably</text>
  <text start="402.059" dur="5.79">investigating child trafficking him and</text>
  <text start="404.069" dur="6.99">his wife had a charity devoted to this</text>
  <text start="407.849" dur="6.92">and from what I read it looked like they</text>
  <text start="411.059" dur="6.21">were getting very close to something so</text>
  <text start="414.769" dur="6.12">some people say that chester bennington</text>
  <text start="417.269" dur="6.03">looks a whole lot like John Podesta</text>
  <text start="420.889" dur="10.12">which I agree I think they look</text>
  <text start="423.299" dur="11.82">uncannily similar this is what Cornell</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="5.88">and chester bennington were up to so</text>
  <text start="435.119" dur="5.36">they were tracking down this alleged</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="8.37">pedophile ring under the name of Arana</text>

  <text start="449.699" dur="6.63">named with a username of swordfish 69</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="4.54">and this is basically like a big not</text>
  <text start="456.329" dur="4.35">only call it a trip code but this was</text>
  <text start="457.889" dur="4.8">like this looks like something that was</text>
  <text start="460.679" dur="4.41">released after his death and I think it</text>
  <text start="462.689" dur="6.87">was kind of like insurance on his life</text>
  <text start="465.089" dur="6.36">but there&amp;#39;s this one out - I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="469.559" dur="3.36">where this I haven&amp;#39;t I haven&amp;#39;t really</text>

  <text start="472.919" dur="3.99">hashtag it ends now</text>
  <text start="474.089" dur="4.56">and I&amp;#39;ve seen this before on Twitter but</text>
  <text start="476.909" dur="4.74">I haven&amp;#39;t followed up on it yet so I</text>
  <text start="478.649" dur="4.83">hope he got something out of this again</text>
