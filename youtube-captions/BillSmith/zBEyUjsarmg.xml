  <text start="2.48" dur="3.819">before we get started I just want to</text>
  <text start="4.74" dur="3.569">give a shout out to everybody that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6.299" dur="3.871">been mentioned on the Q board I think he</text>
  <text start="8.309" dur="4.861">was done a good job of calling out</text>
  <text start="10.17" dur="5.339">people just in our little Club here</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="4.529">people on Twitter and kind of spreading</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="5.341">the love I like that so shout out to</text>
  <text start="17.699" dur="7.711">Laura&amp;#39;s prison I think he was replying</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="6.419">to Jordan SATA earlier so they got</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="4.519">mentioned on the Q post I thought that</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="5.04">was really cool now the purpose of this</text>
  <text start="29.929" dur="4.481">video is to tell you about this thing</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="4.741">called the Q clock I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="4.71">already seen it I think neon revolt put</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="3.27">out an article at the beginning of June</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re gonna take a look at that in a</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="5.04">second but first I&amp;#39;m gonna show you what</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="5.249">this thing is this is what the Q clock</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.85">looks like and it&amp;#39;s a really really</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="8">simple idea essentially just like a</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="8.54">regular clock has 60 seconds in one hour</text>
  <text start="55.789" dur="8.561">this Q clock is set up based on a</text>
  <text start="59.75" dur="8.29">revolving series of 60 days at a time so</text>
  <text start="64.35" dur="6">on the Q clock 60 days equals one hour</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="5.22">so one revolution of the Q clock would</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="7.17">be equals 60 days on our actual our</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="6.96">nough on our actual calendar okay so it</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="4.26">starts if I know you can&amp;#39;t see it very</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="7.32">well on here so I&amp;#39;ll post a better</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="8.79">picture but it starts on 10:28 and the</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="4.95">marker given is 20 and I&amp;#39;ll show you</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ll show you a couple base level proof</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="3.54">so that I can show you this is actually</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.59">legit and then you can start tracking</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="6.69">stories against it okay one thing to</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="5.75">slip in there is how you read the clock</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="7.95">is that you just find your date on here</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="8.8">so today&amp;#39;s date is the 24th of July so</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.979">if we were to search out here the 24th</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="5.399">of July is right here so it&amp;#39;s the very</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="5.941">last most updated recent day posted on</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="5.671">the Q clock now the circles on the Q</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="6.169">clock equal Q posts so it&amp;#39;s dates that</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="6.299">that the Q team or q and on posted and</text>
  <text start="127.759" dur="5.23">the way you look at it is you look at</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="2.701">the series let&amp;#39;s just take 49 for</text>
  <text start="132.989" dur="3.961">example</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="7.29">so if there was a marker with 49 we</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="8.31">would see posts on a level 11 26 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="9.659">November 26th last year January 25th</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="7.83">March 26th May 25th and July 24th and</text>
  <text start="150.629" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s possible that all these posts are</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="6.599">related possible that&amp;#39;s just a way to go</text>
  <text start="157.079" dur="4.981">along with the conversation now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.689" dur="5.761">one minute to ten so the mirror of that</text>
  <text start="162.06" dur="6.75">would be one minute to four and we would</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="8.52">get things on the 19th on the 19 second</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="8.399">mark which was 12 26 February 24th April</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.849">25th and June 24th so I hope that you</text>
  <text start="177.209" dur="4.021">get that so the way to read the clock</text>
  <text start="179.819" dur="4.29">would be to find the second that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="4.53">at based on the date that you&amp;#39;re on find</text>
  <text start="184.109" dur="5.1">the other dates that line up with the</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="6.39">circle so on that same second on on</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="5.37">smaller circles past hours I guess in</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="5.61">the clock and then when they say think</text>
  <text start="194.579" dur="4.831">mirror sometimes that could correspond</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="4.86">to something on the other side of the</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="5.25">clock on that other series of dates so I</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="5.97">hope that I&amp;#39;ve made it as clear as I can</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="6.299">about how to read this clock so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="3.539">just a way to track conversations it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="2.7">just one more thing to look at in the Q</text>
  <text start="212.129" dur="3.54">post you know it&amp;#39;s probably not</text>
  <text start="213.659" dur="4.021">necessary that you understand this long</text>
  <text start="215.669" dur="5.761">term you know things will happen or they</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="5.309">won&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;ll have to look at reports to</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="3.479">verify these like we do in all the other</text>
  <text start="222.989" dur="5.131">videos but this is the cue clock and</text>
  <text start="224.909" dur="4.83">that is how to read it okay so I want to</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.72">go back here and I want to show you how</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="4.59">this was found okay full credit to the</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="5.039">nons on here again there&amp;#39;s a neon revolt</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="5.16">article that I can link you to he</text>
  <text start="236.879" dur="4.86">actually posted twice neon revolt posted</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="3.96">two different articles about this they</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="3.991">were a little difficult to understand so</text>
  <text start="243.449" dur="6.791">I&amp;#39;m trying to clean it up a little bit</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="8.62">okay now show you some proofs if we come</text>
  <text start="250.24" dur="6.62">to the q post and we type in marker okay</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ll get some we&amp;#39;ll get some markers</text>
  <text start="256.86" dur="6.25">now let&amp;#39;s go to the very beginning let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="8.1">go look at the very very first one okay</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="9.27">now on October 31st 2017 on Q post</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="7.26">number 26 we get this message think</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="5.25">about it logically the only way is the</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="5.57">military fully controlled save and</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="7.08">spread once</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="8.62">11:3 verifies as the first marker</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="6.6">biggest advance drop on pole okay so</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="4.91">let&amp;#39;s just take this line eleven three</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="5.13">verifies as the first marker and</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.47">remember the post number is twenty six</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="5.16">so we&amp;#39;re post number twenty six says</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="8.7">that eleven three verifies as the very</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="9.42">first marker okay now if we go to eleven</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="6">three on the cue clock I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="4.83">really really hard to read this so you</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="7.32">can come check this out yourself I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="6.48">looking for 11 311 311 three is right</text>
  <text start="321.64" dur="5.1">there</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="6.24">that&amp;#39;s eleven three and it&amp;#39;s at 26</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="6.18">seconds on the cue clock</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="10.08">26 seconds eleven three is the 26th</text>
  <text start="332.92" dur="8.01">second on the cue clock so eleven three</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="7.61">verified as the first marker of the cue</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="5.33">clock and it&amp;#39;s post number 26</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="4.33">fantastic right and that&amp;#39;s the very</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="6.12">first mention of a marker anywhere in</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="7.23">the cue post so this is kind of how it</text>
  <text start="355.24" dur="6.06">works there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s lots of stamps in</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="5.94">here we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve matched a lot of these</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="5.82">up to like tweet timestamps with Trump</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="4.56">weird synchronicities across like</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="3.3">speeches things like that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="2.46">there&amp;#39;s lots of that in here I just</text>
  <text start="370.42" dur="2.999">wanted to show you this one because I</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t think I saw this one documented</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="3.81">anywhere and the literature anywhere on</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="3.96">Twitter it&amp;#39;s one I&amp;#39;ve just found on my</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="4.021">own now I dug around</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="2.76">more and I found a few other markers I</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="2.43">don&amp;#39;t think people have pointed these</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="3.54">out yet but I want to get the proof</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="3.36">documented really well so that we can</text>
  <text start="385.72" dur="3.63">just put this to bed about whether or</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="4.47">not the cue clock is real or not at this</text>
  <text start="389.35" dur="5.88">point I&amp;#39;m positive that the cue clock is</text>
  <text start="391.51" dur="5.85">real after this is going to be about how</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="3.72">we learn to read it so here&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="5.76">couple more proofs this is on January</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="7.62">7th 2018 okay so we&amp;#39;re gonna find</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="5.73">January 7th on the cue clock and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="3.6">down here somewhere right there so I</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="1.83">know you can&amp;#39;t see it upside down just</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="5.1">trust me</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="11.55">it&amp;#39;s at second number 31 so it&amp;#39;s at the</text>
  <text start="415.27" dur="8.88">second marker 31 so it said they</text>
  <text start="422.23" dur="5.55">confirmed the first marker now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.15" dur="8.91">gonna confirm this confirmed 15 10 5 and</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="11.43">1 15 plus 10 is 25 plus 5 is 30 plus 1</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="8.55">is 31 confirmed 31 so you get it so on</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="4.92">January 7th we found the 31st 2nd and</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s what these add up to so this is</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="3.87">another confirmation now there&amp;#39;s a bunch</text>
  <text start="446.35" dur="4.86">of markers in here they all correspond</text>
  <text start="448" dur="4.92">to different stuff I can cover all these</text>
  <text start="451.21" dur="4.08">sometime in the future but I thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="4.17">go to the latest one just so we got the</text>
  <text start="455.29" dur="3.84">first one one in the middle and then the</text>
  <text start="457.09" dur="3.78">last one that we reached this was a</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="2.7">really famous post if you remember this</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="6.87">was the cue gun</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="7.58">cue post number 14 64 it says number 100</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="4.56">dark to light</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.12">107 marker and then it gives a link to a</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="6.36">video and it says do you believe in</text>
  <text start="473.53" dur="8.52">coincidences okay 107 marker so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.66" dur="6.21">gonna go to 14 64 that&amp;#39;s the post number</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s on June 12th so we&amp;#39;re gonna go find</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="15.69">June 12 for the cue clock June 12th is</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="13.37">up here and it&amp;#39;s at 2nd 0 7 0 7 so 1 0 7</text>
  <text start="500.56" dur="2.9">marker</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="2.82">so those are the three proofs that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="4.079">going to put together to prove that the</text>
  <text start="508.15" dur="4.559">cue clock is legit it&amp;#39;s real it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="510.699" dur="4.95">useful tool they&amp;#39;ve embedded it somehow</text>
  <text start="512.709" dur="5.19">right so they have been working to get</text>
  <text start="515.649" dur="4.471">us the cue clock since the beginning now</text>
  <text start="517.899" dur="3.69">we have it again credit to neon revolt</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="3.539">for pulling it off the chance and</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="3.781">getting the first blog post online I</text>
  <text start="523.659" dur="4.11">know other people will covered this as</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="4.14">well but this is my coverage so it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="527.769" dur="4.681">my channel so I hope you got something</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="5.069">out of that now I&amp;#39;m going to show you</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="4.41">how people are putting this to use so</text>
  <text start="534.579" dur="4.741">this isn&amp;#39;t the best example it&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="536.86" dur="5.49">example that was placed out today just</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="4.92">recently so I cross my cross my plate I</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="5.429">saw it it does a good job of showing the</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="5.339">mirror image now some people are</text>
  <text start="547.779" dur="4.231">thinking now that whenever a Q says</text>
  <text start="549.579" dur="4.171">think mirror he means again to go back</text>
  <text start="552.01" dur="3.21">to the other side of the clock so this</text>
  <text start="553.75" dur="4.079">is a good graphic that shows how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="6.33">accomplished it also shows how the</text>
  <text start="557.829" dur="8.791">tweets from that day match up so if you</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="9.36">go to the mirror image of today&amp;#39;s event</text>
  <text start="566.62" dur="6.12">on July 24th and we actually did get</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="4.23">some Q posts today and you mirror that</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="5.73">you get March 10th and it talks about</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="6.24">watch the speech now today&amp;#39;s big news</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="5.79">you know is it&amp;#39;s proof I guess that Q</text>
  <text start="581.38" dur="5.79">tossed out there was Trump had a speech</text>
  <text start="584.26" dur="6.03">in Kansas City or Kansas downtown Kansas</text>

  <text start="605.709" dur="6.541">super fantastic in any way I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="5.28">great you know it gave some people an</text>
