  <text start="0.03" dur="6.69">hey what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s Bill Smith so</text>
  <text start="3.689" dur="5.101">over the last like three to four weeks</text>
  <text start="6.72" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot more interested in the</text>
  <text start="8.79" dur="6.03">source of information I realize that by</text>
  <text start="12.3" dur="4.41">the time it hits YouTube it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="14.82" dur="3.69">like two or three levels removed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="16.71" dur="4.35">kind of similar if it&amp;#39;s on Twitter or</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="4.41">Facebook and it&amp;#39;s really easy to take</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="6.209">something out of context and then have</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="6.42">that be the truth you know so I I think</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="3.451">most of us that make these types of</text>
  <text start="29.34" dur="3.239">videos we always try to trace it back to</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="4.41">like whatever source you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="32.579" dur="5.941">using I go off alike a lot of mainstream</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.1">media articles for example just because</text>
  <text start="38.52" dur="3.9">if they&amp;#39;re gonna publish it you know</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="5.009">it&amp;#39;s out there so why not report on it</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="7.26">but there&amp;#39;s a big difference between a</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="8.401">magazine like cosmopolitan and a random</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="5.809">account on Twitter okay so one of the</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="5.009">things I thought about recently was this</text>
  <text start="55.489" dur="4.721">operation Backyard Brawl everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.649" dur="3.241">talking about it you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="60.21" dur="3.63">conversation we&amp;#39;re gonna keep having and</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="3.87">rightfully so I think it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="4.62">conversation to have even if that thing</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="4.83">isn&amp;#39;t you know quote-unquote like rape</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="4.62">camp or whatever even if it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="5.25">coyote camp I doubt it&amp;#39;s a homeless camp</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="6.63">I just highly doubt that it&amp;#39;s a homeless</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="6.99">camp so you know any any exposure to</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="4.229">need that is good for me plus it put</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="5.429">some people&amp;#39;s attention down by the</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="5.64">border and you know there&amp;#39;s lots of I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="4.771">sure there&amp;#39;s shaky stuff going on in</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="4.941">Tucson so we should just keep looking so</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="3.54">what struck me weird about this hashtag</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="4.66">was it was just like all the other</text>
  <text start="96.57" dur="6.78">hashtags they started giving you wrong</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="6.509">spellings and then as you picked the</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.82">wrong spellings then the first hashtag</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="5.011">is diluted and then it stops trending so</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="3.15">this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever attract</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="4.559">one of these down I decided to take a</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="5.64">look just to see how it works and this</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.881">is the very first tweet from Operation</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="6.63">Backyard Brawl it was made by cat</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="8.069">Guardino that&amp;#39;s her account right there</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="7.35">and I looked at cats account and she</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="4.801">seems like a really legit person she</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="5.04">seems like a really nice person</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="5.309">this all seems real you know it seems</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.95">that way and you know there&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="139.319" dur="6.331">that I follow that follow her who I</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="5.16">think are legit so and there&amp;#39;s lots of</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="3.21">good stuff on here it&amp;#39;s a really active</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.17">page I can see why people would want to</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="5.76">follow it it&amp;#39;s got good information all</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="5.91">very accurate ok so that was the very</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="5.64">first tweet and notice it got a got a</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.539">retweet and I got three likes and then</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="4.92">you know the next one was another</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="4.601">retweet and a couple likes and retweet</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="5.55">and then a comment and like so it took</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="7.2">off pretty quickly there was activity is</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="13.14">what I&amp;#39;m trying to say okay now this was</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="10.83">on June 1st 2018 at 9:57 a.m. ok the</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.13">misspelling the first one the</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="6.539">misspelling shows up is on June 3rd</text>
  <text start="188" dur="8.29">here&amp;#39;s the timestamp on that 3:47 p.m.</text>
  <text start="191.879" dur="6.48">on the 3rd of June ok so what happened</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="6.089">was is this person stacked it as the top</text>
  <text start="198.359" dur="6.27">and I don&amp;#39;t know if maybe maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="202.379" dur="6.901">Twitter and gave them a misspelling and</text>
  <text start="204.629" dur="9.57">they clicked it that&amp;#39;s possible or maybe</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="7.109">they did this on purpose just you know</text>
  <text start="214.199" dur="4.831">kind of thinking out loud here now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.389" dur="5.611">see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s two days later right and</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="6.209">there&amp;#39;s no activity on it no comments or</text>
  <text start="222" dur="7.079">retweets or likes and then the next one</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="6.87">comes the same day so there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="5.72">timestamp on that one 405 so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="8.75">pretty close together right 3:47 p.m.</text>
  <text start="234.799" dur="8.94">and then 405 p.m. and then watch this</text>
  <text start="240.859" dur="5.081">that&amp;#39;s the first one that links the two</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="4.601">so the first ones were just to</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="4.469">misspellings to show that they exist and</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.3">then there was a follow-up tweet to link</text>
  <text start="250.409" dur="5.991">them together see the two of them</text>
  <text start="253.64" dur="7.319">and they were all done apart by less</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="6.96">than was that like three hours so they</text>
  <text start="260.959" dur="5.251">seated the misspelling on these two</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.88">accounts it looks like and then they</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="4.41">linked them together and this is the</text>
  <text start="269.24" dur="3.03">first one they got a comment so they put</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="3.39">a comment on there I gave it a little</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="4.5">bit more juice and then notice how it</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="6.48">took off now this one&amp;#39;s got some</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="8.1">activity on it and that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="7.08">just for this so you can come look at</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="4.2">this yourself I&amp;#39;m not saying that any of</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="2.46">this are Sh</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="2.64">you know I&amp;#39;m not saying they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="4.95">shill accounts or anything I&amp;#39;m not even</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="6.44">sure it was on purpose I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="294.98" dur="3.17">just saying this is how it happened</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="13.8">so this is the first one to tweet out</text>
  <text start="302.45" dur="13.44">the the wrong label and you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="5.43">know I don&amp;#39;t know what to say it could</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="8.04">have just totally been an accident you</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="6.66">know this was the second one I think to</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="4.62">tweet this was the one to link them all</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="5.7">together now the weird part is is over</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="4.35">here sometimes this doesn&amp;#39;t show up even</text>
  <text start="331.28" dur="3.81">though that&amp;#39;s the only that&amp;#39;s the real</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="3.9">one for a while only the misspelling was</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="4.17">showing up and then sometimes the</text>
  <text start="336.8" dur="4.26">misspelling would show up capitalized</text>
  <text start="339.26" dur="4.05">but the real one would show up all</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="4.56">lowercase I mean they did a lot of</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="9.18">things to people to keep them from from</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="8.97">trending that hashtag to me it looks</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="5.1">suspicious I&amp;#39;ll just say that it looks</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="4.5">suspicious that these early tweets would</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="3.86">have this is the very first tweet I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="6.99">telling you this is the very first tweet</text>
  <text start="361.45" dur="7">ever to use this and this is how it</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.59">skipped over from Facebook on to the</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="6.57">Twitter platform is this tweet right</text>
  <text start="370.67" dur="7.74">here so cat gardino is responsible for</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6.27">taking operation Backyard Brawl off of</text>
  <text start="378.41" dur="4.77">facebook and putting it on Twitter she</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="10.08">was the very first person to do it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="9.63">a good job Kate Kat so I just I like</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="4.08">looking at this stuff because I like</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="7.32">seeing how information flows and these</text>
  <text start="395.45" dur="6.06">systems it&amp;#39;s one thing to have a you</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="4.59">know your finger on the button somewhere</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="6.33">in the company right but it&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="5.31">other thing to be able to defeat these</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="4.62">kind of things from outside where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.08">at so I don&amp;#39;t know if this was on</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="5.37">accident again this was the first one</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="5.309">and then two days later here was the</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="6.03">misspelling the first time we saw that</text>
  <text start="419.419" dur="8.391">misspelling show up how quickly it took</text>
  <text start="423.86" dur="6.45">off it could just be an innocent mistake</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="3.94">that just made its way and it could be</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="2.97">you know two or three controlled</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="4.23">accounts did this and no</text>

  <text start="468.23" dur="3.15">was hanging out there the handle was up</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="3.899">for grabs someone grabbed the free</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="6">handle after it had already been used</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="5.701">and then the tweets linked up but what</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="3.78">are the odds that people would have the</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.83">exact same feedback about about that</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="6.12">person&amp;#39;s personality within two or three</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="4.83">tweets it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just unlikely you</text>
