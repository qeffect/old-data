  <text start="230.13" dur="9.689">there was anything weird it was creepy</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="8.799">strange odd but going back and looking</text>

  <text start="246.09" dur="7.41">released stuff about Tom Hanks in the</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="7.26">last week has been eye-opening so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="3.299">supposed to Tom Hanks was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="3.599">like the the best of the best the</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.821">cleanest of the cleanest and he might be</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="7.141">one of the dirtiest of the dirty so</text>
  <text start="261.62" dur="6.1">where does that leave us as people you</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="3.42">know society</text>

  <text start="269.1" dur="4.89">talking about Tom Hanks there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="8.67">a difference there a gigantic ocean of</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="8.1">difference so I think we need to</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="4.14">maintain our pure hearts and I think</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="4.86">that can heal the world I think that if</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.22">we maintain our purity and it&amp;#39;s okay if</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="5.55">you do things that are bad none of us</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="5.76">are perfect okay if you have a drug</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="4.53">habit you know sometimes you got an</text>
  <text start="295.17" dur="4.74">anger problem sometimes you don&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="4.59">up to work for time on time or you miss</text>
  <text start="299.91" dur="4.79">things that you should be going to you</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="7.11">don&amp;#39;t go to things that you should go to</text>
  <text start="304.7" dur="10.06">it&amp;#39;s okay you&amp;#39;re one of the good ones</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="8.34">all right we&amp;#39;re in this together okay so</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="5.13">where is this all going because I want</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="6.3">to see right now keep I&amp;#39;ve realized</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="5.279">something in the last day I guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="3.95">really it&amp;#39;s really been impressed upon</text>
  <text start="325.169" dur="5.161">me that this is an open source project</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="4.9">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing here okay Q has</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="5.1">given us coded messages because they</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t share confidential information it</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="4.23">would break the law and then they</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t have any integrity and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="4.53">the point in doing something if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="3.54">not gonna have integrity right you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="3.12">not you&amp;#39;re not any good if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.51" dur="3.21">have that so they didn&amp;#39;t break the law</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="3.81">by doing any of this stuff</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="3.78">they just said here are some cloth here</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="3.42">are some clues here are some breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="3.72">now go find some articles that</text>
  <text start="354.54" dur="4.14">substantiate what we&amp;#39;re saying in these</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="6.27">clues because if they said anymore</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="8.73">it might break you know confidential</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="6.929">secrecy laws so I guess that that all</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="4.16">brings me to this point what is the Red</text>
