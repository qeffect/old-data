  <text start="15.9" dur="5.219">report came out I covered it the minute</text>
  <text start="19.23" dur="3.51">it came out within two hours all right</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="3.691">and then I got people commenting on my</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="3.39">channel saying there&amp;#39;s nothing in there</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="3.539">we&amp;#39;ve already gone to other channels</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="3.36">like Traci beans or other places and</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;ve already said there&amp;#39;s nothing in</text>
  <text start="29.49" dur="5.64">there and what I said in that video I</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="6.81">tried to be as clear as I could is that</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="5.999">this this oh I GE report was 564 pages</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="4.08">long so you&amp;#39;re not gonna know what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="3.061">there for a week and the people that are</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="3.75">gonna tell you are gonna be mainstream</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="4.02">media newspapers and sure enough that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="3.63">where most of the information and our</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="4.98">cue non-community has come from it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="5.25">mainstream media news reports this</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="5.279">frustrates me greatly because they all</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="4.739">have a vested interest in one side or</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="3">the other and I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="2.971">and what&amp;#39;s not I don&amp;#39;t know who wants</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="3.391">things to be true and who wants them to</text>
  <text start="63.03" dur="4.019">be false I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="3.9">divert and deflect I think it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="5.64">that we started talking about splitting</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="6.09">up kids at the border and Walmart okay I</text>
  <text start="72.689" dur="3.75">think that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s extremely weird that</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="6.089">we would start talking about that the</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="5.941">day the OIG report comes out so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="3.211">just too much in there man there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="5.07">too much in there okay and you read</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="4.2">rumors he talked to Devin Nunez I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="2.279">need I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m gonna upload</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="2.75">this video so I&amp;#39;m just gonna talk man</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;ll just tell you everything I know so</text>
  <text start="91.1" dur="5.65">Devin Nunez had a tweet talking about</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.081">so-and-so who speaks French now the</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.439">first time I read the OIG report there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="4.11">only one word in there if you search for</text>
  <text start="101.189" dur="4.5">the word French it only shows up one</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="5.699">time and it shows up an instant message</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="5.341">conversation between two DOJ attorneys</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.911">and I think that possibly those two</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="5.369">attorneys were Nellie and Bruce or</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="4.57">possibly you know I don&amp;#39;t know that for</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="4.201">certain that hasn&amp;#39;t come out yet but</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="3.93">Nunez said someone speaks French and it</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="6.21">was a DOJ attorney and that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="6.629">thing that shows up in the 564 pages</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="4.62">that really stood out to me okay I did</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.941">that I wouldn&amp;#39;t looked I found it now he</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="6.32">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying to tell people</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="6.42">is that other other people like seething</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="4.56">frog they get annoyed or aggravated if I</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="3.869">could represent his opinion he can</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="4.74">clarify this but seething frog was</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="5.941">aggravated because he says that the news</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="5.1">cycle only lasts about a week it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="4.38">short to get anything real done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="3.66">easy to distract from if it only runs a</text>
  <text start="154.28" dur="3.72">week and then never shows up again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="3.959">easy to bury these stories and it&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="158" dur="2.85">to say look we talked about it you know</text>
  <text start="159.769" dur="4.411">we talked about it for a week and</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="5.58">nothing came out of it so it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="164.18" dur="5.4">to pick a theme if you are going to</text>

  <text start="239.6" dur="5.16">avoid the hierarchical structure I want</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="4.35">to avoid that totally I would prefer to</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6.63">have independent people who group</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="7.14">themselves into like-minded cells you</text>
  <text start="251.39" dur="4.26">get it so that the next time a school</text>

  <text start="275.51" dur="4.53">know general news or Christian thinking</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m just saying that if you have groups</text>
  <text start="280.04" dur="4.98">of people okay that&amp;#39;s enough one person</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="4.2">cannot do this so you need more than one</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="3.03">person more than one place to go so they</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="4.08">can share their work with each other</text>
  <text start="288.05" dur="4.23">they can build on top of it and then if</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="3.57">one of them too gets taken out it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="3.96">big deal the whole cell is probably not</text>
