  <text start="308.22" dur="3.6">whistleblower and it&amp;#39;s really weird I</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="3.78">mean some weird stuff happened on</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="7.26">Twitter yesterday with that guy you know</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="6.21">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s threatening the</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="3.27">world with his suicide right now on</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="5.1">Twitter if he did if you missed that he</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="7.14">was a whistleblower for WikiLeaks early</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="7.38">I admire what he did the risk II took</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="7.26">but if he went into the camp was</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="5.31">tortured mind controlled MKULTRA and</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="3.33">then they said look we&amp;#39;ll let you out</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="3.24">but you got to get a sex change first</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.86">that would make a lot of sense to me</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="6.48">and then you parade that guy out and say</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="4.65">look it&amp;#39;s not just all of it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="2.49">all a Hollywood that&amp;#39;s gonna do this</text>

  <text start="363.47" dur="5.89">not kill himself but at the same time it</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="5.4">seems really really weird the timing of</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="4.86">that doesn&amp;#39;t it WikiLeaks is being</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.19">called out as fake phony and comped and</text>

  <text start="377.25" dur="5.67">in New York City ready to jump you know</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="4.38">right in suicide notes and stuff I just</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="4.92">find the timing suspect of that and it</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="6.09">also shows you that no matter no matter</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="6">how much the world wants you to accept</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="5.73">that these people are healthy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="5.729">not okay this is a mental disease it it</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="9.149">doesn&amp;#39;t need to be supported</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="8.85">it needs to be helped and and you know</text>
  <text start="406.589" dur="3.72">we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t tell crazy people that</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="4.74">the voices in their heads are real we</text>
  <text start="410.309" dur="4.95">say we try to give them help if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.159" dur="4.62">schizophrenic you try to give them help</text>

  <text start="428.099" dur="3.93">feel good I&amp;#39;ll cover this down here in a</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="2.819">second now I do want to say a couple</text>
  <text start="432.029" dur="3.51">things I&amp;#39;ve already reshot this video</text>
  <text start="433.589" dur="3.3">twice because I caught myself lip</text>
  <text start="435.539" dur="2.791">smacking or whatever I was doing there</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="3.27">that was causing it clicking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="6">embarrassing now that I&amp;#39;ve figured out</text>
  <text start="440.159" dur="5.701">what that was the biggest thing that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="3.209">gonna say about this is like I kind of</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="3.869">regret the way this has worked out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="5.041">not easy to take an early position on</text>
  <text start="449.729" dur="4.351">something it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not easy you</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="2.91">know I kind of sit back and I wait to</text>

  <text start="762.089" dur="3.571">we don&amp;#39;t have any confirmation yet so</text>
  <text start="763.709" dur="4.081">chemtrails are the last to go clear</text>
  <text start="765.66" dur="5.129">skies equals the war being over that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="767.79" dur="4.43">what I got Alex Jones all right I</text>
  <text start="770.789" dur="4.41">shouldn&amp;#39;t even have to say this anymore</text>
  <text start="772.22" dur="5.319">Alex Jones has repeatedly said that he</text>
  <text start="775.199" dur="5.64">has met Q and on that he&amp;#39;s talked to him</text>
  <text start="777.539" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s not true Alex Jones is a liar and I</text>
  <text start="780.839" dur="3.27">think that Alex Jones getting out in</text>
  <text start="782.279" dur="3.27">front of that Pizza Gate stuff and then</text>
  <text start="784.109" dur="3.6">not talking about the actual evidence</text>

  <text start="804.779" dur="4.861">stuff I think he buried it I think that</text>
  <text start="806.76" dur="4.65">was what happened so you know at this</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="3.21">point we could release a picture of Alex</text>

  <text start="839.04" dur="5.16">channel 17 I&amp;#39;ve talked about this I</text>
  <text start="842.13" dur="4.23">released that video it moved the</text>

  <text start="855.57" dur="3.51">talked about this stuff that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="857.339" dur="4.741">had to lie about the back channel 17</text>
  <text start="859.08" dur="5.43">identity and it looks like Adam Schiff</text>
