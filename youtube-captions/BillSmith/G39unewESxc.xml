  <text start="6.21" dur="3">released</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="4.349">William Barr released it with eight</text>
  <text start="9.21" dur="3.96">hundred and thirtysomething redactions</text>
  <text start="11.429" dur="4.94">in it so there there is some redactions</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="5.76">in this but this is the full text of it</text>
  <text start="16.369" dur="5.561">before I start I just want to point out</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="6.179">that it&amp;#39;s amazing now okay it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="5.28">that places like the NPR actually post</text>
  <text start="25.109" dur="4.41">these documents now to the open Internet</text>
  <text start="27.21" dur="4.44">you used to have to dig for this stuff a</text>
  <text start="29.519" dur="4.651">year ago people weren&amp;#39;t doing it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="31.65" dur="5.909">only because people like us people on</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="6.209">YouTube demanded it and we pushed it so</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="5.07">now if these breaking stories happen and</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="4.981">you don&amp;#39;t actually get to read the</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="5.101">actual document understand there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.34">probably a reason for that so this is</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="5.969">the rarest of the rare occasions where</text>
  <text start="50.7" dur="5.609">the entire news media says hey look</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="7.41">there&amp;#39;s a big report that just got</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="7.111">released and let&amp;#39;s go look at it this is</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="6.241">the report on the investigation into</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="7.379">Russian interference in the 2016</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.97">presidential election volume one of two</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="4.82">and I don&amp;#39;t know if anybody else is</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="6.27">going to point this out volume one of</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="7.091">two by special counsel Robert s Mueller</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="5.4">the third now there is something I want</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="7.71">to drop in here this was released by</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="8.129">William Barr so this report was done by</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="5.22">Robert Mueller on behalf of the Attorney</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="4.29">General and the Attorney General now is</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="3.99">William Barr there&amp;#39;s a rumor going</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="3.841">around that says that everybody knows</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="4.83">that William bara has already served as</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="6.24">attorney general I think under Bush the</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="5.729">second Bush but people are also saying</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="6.3">that William bar is it goes by another</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="7.741">name and that he is a was a CIA asset at</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="4.74">one point in time this is the article in</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="4.829">question</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s January 19th 2019 it&amp;#39;s on global</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.32">research CA this is a Canadian website I</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="3.749">imagine I have no idea if this is real</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="3.331">or not it was just a really caught my</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.231">eye and I thought it was worth dropping</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.6">in there so they bring up a lot of deep</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="2.639">state people</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="5.16">and Trump&amp;#39;s cabinet people like john</text>
  <text start="135.659" dur="5.991">bolton and says that william bar is one</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="6.209">of these people william bar was an</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="6.49">iran-contra coke conspirator so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.379" dur="6.061">that&amp;#39;s what this article says i haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="5.129">i have not confirmed this yet but that</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="6.629">would be that would be extremely</text>
  <text start="153.269" dur="6.421">interesting so this article is lengthy</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="4.111">it says that william bara isn&amp;#39;t his</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="4.439">birth given name says that he was a CIA</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="3.419">asset from the age of like 16 or</text>
  <text start="164.129" dur="4.14">something that they funded him through</text>
  <text start="165.599" dur="4.5">law school it makes a lot of accusations</text>
  <text start="168.269" dur="4.62">i&amp;#39;m not sure if any of this is real or</text>
  <text start="170.099" dur="6.331">not but this is a picture of him with</text>
  <text start="172.889" dur="8.25">joe biden back in 1991 then-senator Joe</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="6.57">Biden alright so I haven&amp;#39;t read this</text>
  <text start="181.139" dur="5.611">nobody has it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just been released</text>
  <text start="183" dur="5.22">about a half hour ago and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="2.76">gonna kind of skim it real quick because</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="2.879">I wanted to get this up as quick as</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="2.819">possible mostly for the link so you</text>

  <text start="192.329" dur="9.571">yourself I don&amp;#39;t think I think that if</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="6.699">William bar was a fixer under Bush and a</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="4.589">CIA asset for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="204.359" dur="4.111">timing of this is very interesting so</text>

  <text start="543.36" dur="7.11">presidential election which doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="5.82">any sense if you remember how much money</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="5.79">he put in to win the presidential</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="6.12">election and people will go well he was</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="5.61">just trying to gain some more publicity</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="4.68">and limelight you know so that he could</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="4.53">capitalize and grow his brand after a</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="4.92">failed campaign bid but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.4" dur="4.32">make any sense given the amount of work</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="4.77">they put into winning that election and</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="6.36">the amount of personal money that Donald</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="6.48">Trump spent to win I mean what did he</text>
  <text start="577.08" dur="5.67">spend like 350 or 400 million dollars I</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="5.01">forget it was some absurd amount but he</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="3.66">put his own money in and nobody does</text>
  <text start="585" dur="3.36">that okay</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s why Bloomberg&amp;#39;s not gonna run</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="3.42">because he didn&amp;#39;t have the backing of</text>
  <text start="589.59" dur="4.26">anybody and he thought he was gonna do</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="3.44">what Trump did and it didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="4.2">for him that you didn&amp;#39;t have any backing</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="4.69">so Trump&amp;#39;s got the backing of Sheldon</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="4.38">Adelson or whatever his name is from Fox</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="5.1">Fox put him in the middle of the stage</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="4.2">at the Republican national debate and I</text>
  <text start="605.01" dur="3.54">could never figure out how that happened</text>
  <text start="606.63" dur="4.23">you know they didn&amp;#39;t want him to win he</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="3.66">would have been over on the edge but he</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="4.53">was out in front on the birther stuff</text>
  <text start="612.21" dur="4.77">which got me I mean I&amp;#39;ve loved Trump</text>
  <text start="615.39" dur="4.19">since he started talking smack on Obama</text>
  <text start="616.98" dur="5.13">you know calling out blatant lies about</text>

  <text start="639.27" dur="6.75">disinformation and people have to guess</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="8.07">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="6.69">don&amp;#39;t add up so then people have to do</text>
  <text start="649.17" dur="5.1">nothing more than guess you know why did</text>
