  <text start="167.18" dur="4.11">political viewpoints we do rank tweets</text>
  <text start="169.82" dur="3.93">by default to make Twitter more</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="6.69">immediately relevant which can be</text>
  <text start="173.75" dur="5.94">flipped off I didn&amp;#39;t know that all right</text>

  <text start="183.86" dur="5.31">check this out so this blog post just</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.68">got posted yesterday it&amp;#39;s by two people</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="7.11">I don&amp;#39;t know I guess they work for</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="9.21">Twitter says they don&amp;#39;t Shadow Man right</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="5.61">I came down here and here&amp;#39;s the answer</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="4.44">that we&amp;#39;re looking for what happened</text>
  <text start="201.89" dur="4.74">this week yesterday we identified an</text>
  <text start="204.77" dur="5.73">issue where some accounts weren&amp;#39;t Auto</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="5.79">suggested in search there it is</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="3.959">even when people were searching for</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="3.6">their specific name and I&amp;#39;ve documented</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="4.921">this already I got it this is my four</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="5.34">videos that I&amp;#39;ve done to be clear this</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="4.35">only impact that our search auto</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="4.26">suggestions the accounts their tweets</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="3.75">and surrounding conversation about those</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="4.29">accounts were showing up in search</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="4.77">results as of yesterday afternoon this</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="6.42">issue was resolved now here&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="7.02">question it didn&amp;#39;t impact everybody okay</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="5.55">so if some people showed up in that</text>
  <text start="239.27" dur="4.92">search box and some people&amp;#39;s handles</text>
  <text start="241.88" dur="6.24">didn&amp;#39;t then what was the difference</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="6.78">between those accounts was it content</text>
  <text start="248.12" dur="7.44">they had posted was it their friends and</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="7.17">user base this is a common complaint it</text>
  <text start="255.56" dur="4.5">was brought up on Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter feed I</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="3.42">think yesterday or two days ago</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="3.72">and then they came out and addressed it</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="4.2">so it&amp;#39;s all over the news man they had</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="3.54">to issue a statement if they didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="5.79">public pressure they wouldn&amp;#39;t have had</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="7.74">to say anything all right I&amp;#39;ll talk more</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="5.46">about that here in a second I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="4.35">that these the accounts that were</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="4.56">targeted I was on that list I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.41" dur="4.59">show up they were doing something that</text>
  <text start="281.57" dur="5.04">got them flagged there is some sort of</text>
  <text start="284" dur="5.669">flag or check inside a Twitter&amp;#39;s Vertica</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="5.61">database that manages aggregations of</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="4.711">all these these accounts you know they</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="4.23">use a data warehouse the biggest they</text>
  <text start="294.38" dur="3.349">used the biggest Vertica data warehouse</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="3.6">in the world</text>
  <text start="297.729" dur="4.061">that&amp;#39;s what Twitter uses so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="3.63">flags on all the stuff I mean they have</text>
  <text start="301.79" dur="4.29">they have the data they made the choice</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="4.76">based on something so what was that</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="2.36">something</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="4.75">okay so point one says how many people</text>
  <text start="310.97" dur="4.56">were impacted by the search autosuggest</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="4.44">issue hundreds of thousands of accounts</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="3.3">were impacted this impact was not</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="3.539">limited to a certain political</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.68">affiliation or geography and to be clear</text>
  <text start="321.229" dur="4.321">these accounts were only impacted with</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="3.96">search auto suggestions they still</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="4.29">appeared in search results this issue</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="4.92">has been has now been resolved how was</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="4.94">it resolved how did it happen was it a</text>
  <text start="332.39" dur="4.74">bug was it on purpose</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="3.759">did someone activate something they</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="4.77">shouldn&amp;#39;t have what happened</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="5.851">it doesn&amp;#39;t say here&amp;#39;s number two though</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="5.25">quote it looks like this only affected</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="5.279">Republican politicians or Democrat</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="4.53">politicians also impacted yes some</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="4.651">Democratic politicians were not properly</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="7.73">showing up within the search auto</text>
  <text start="354.32" dur="6.96">suggestions as a result of the issue as</text>
  <text start="359.41" dur="3.7">mentioned above the issue was broad</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="7.109">ranging okay you got to believe him</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="7.77">right okay so there was a search</text>
  <text start="368.389" dur="4.111">autosuggest issue but what caused these</text>
  <text start="370.88" dur="5.009">Republican representatives to be</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="5.729">impacted for the most part we believe</text>
  <text start="375.889" dur="4.081">the issue had more to do with how other</text>
  <text start="378.229" dur="4.261">people were interacting with these</text>
  <text start="379.97" dur="6.419">representatives accounts than the</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="6.72">accounts themselves that&amp;#39;s a lie this</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="4.921">there&amp;#39;s no automated trigger okay</text>
  <text start="389.21" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s no automated trigger that would</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="5">just block hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="5.55">counts from showing up in the search box</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="5.7">real accounts okay my account did not</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="8.31">show up in that search box for weeks I</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="7.57">reported on it there are communities</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="3.69">that try to boost each other&amp;#39;s presence</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="3.63">on the platform through a coordinated</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="3.72">engagement we believe these types of</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="4.44">actors engaged with the representatives</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="4.68">accounts the impact of this coordinated</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="3.9">behavior in combination with our</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="3.9">implementation of search auto</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="4.05">suggestions caused the representatives</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="4.98">accounts to not show up in the auto</text>
  <text start="425.6" dur="6">suggestions so I just wanna make this</text>

  <text start="839.769" dur="7.581">remove some problem videos keep him from</text>
  <text start="843.67" dur="6.419">live-streaming for 90 days you know and</text>
  <text start="847.35" dur="6.459">and also keep him on the platform if</text>
