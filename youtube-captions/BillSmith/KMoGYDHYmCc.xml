  <text start="98.43" dur="5.04">still conflict over here so this is</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="4.981">Israel right here I got all the best</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="6.03">land along the Mediterranean ocean so</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="6.809">when people say hey you know that little</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="5.159">strip of land is useless let me tell you</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.801">something buddy that is probably the</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="7.951">most important some of the most valuable</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="9.03">property in the world is the far inland</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="5.84">border along the Mediterranean ocean and</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="5.19">they got it all I got the whole thing</text>
  <text start="128.45" dur="4.24">except for this little piece of piece of</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="2.96">land down here called the Gaza Strip</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.77">which is</text>
  <text start="134.21" dur="5.05">technically Palestine you know along</text>
  <text start="137.46" dur="3.6">with the West Bank but they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="3.48">under military occupation they like to</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="3.27">keep them bunched up so there&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="3.78">lot of development there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="4.49">destruction happening here and the West</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="5.73">Bank and Gaza Strip they like to go in</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="4.78">Israel likes to make settlements and the</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="2.79">best way to make a settlement is to kick</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="4.14">someone off their property and start</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="6.27">building houses there so that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="6.36">that comes from there&amp;#39;s Jordan</text>
  <text start="161.31" dur="4.86">so Jordan chairs a border inland from</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.68">Israel they also have a little bit of</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="6.51">waterfront property down here called the</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="9.21">Gulf of Aqaba</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="9.66">is that it a cue ABA which flows out</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="6.78">into the ocean there&amp;#39;s the Red Sea down</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="3.87">by Yemen okay and Yemen is the southern</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="3.78">tip of Saudi Arabia the Arabian</text>
  <text start="186.21" dur="2.79">Peninsula down here Somalia while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="1.68">on it</text>
  <text start="189" dur="3.57">this is where all the Pirates hang out</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="4.23">man Mogadishu is a freaking war zone you</text>
  <text start="192.57" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t ever want to go there ever</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="4.14">and all these shipping lines come</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="4.2">through here I think and right around</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="4.59">this corner I&amp;#39;ll show you how it all</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="4.32">links up see how it comes through to the</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="4.2">Mediterranean it&amp;#39;s like a shortcut to</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="4.05">get over here so there&amp;#39;s like cruise</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="6.09">liners and shipping shipping container</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="7.71">ships they get boarded by these Somali</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="5.76">pirates which look like some dark</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="3.69">colored skeletons cariann aks on a</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="3.81">fishing boat it&amp;#39;s amazing that they</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="5.6">could actually do it and for a long time</text>
  <text start="223.05" dur="6.39">the only way that they got away with it</text>
  <text start="226.49" dur="6.25">was because there was no armed people on</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="7.35">these cargo container ships so they were</text>
  <text start="232.74" dur="8.31">using like they would use like what</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="5.97">would they use like water water cannons</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="6.69">to fight back these little fishing</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="6.6">vessels they&amp;#39;re like 18 foot it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.74" dur="3.75">embarrassing that they were able to do</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="5.13">it but now these container ships have</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="4.02">armed security guards I just think</text>
  <text start="254.49" dur="2.249">that&amp;#39;s interesting I thought I&amp;#39;d toss</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="2.64">that in there I don&amp;#39;t know how I got off</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="3.421">topic we were talking about Iraq and</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.4">Iran and whatever happened to Syria</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="6.31">right so a Syria done I don&amp;#39;t know we</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="6.76">don&amp;#39;t hear much about it anymore</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="5.94">the interesting part is this though so</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="3.63">when people want to say that Israel is</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="4.71">responsible for a ton of Middle East</text>

  <text start="389.8" dur="3.84">conflict I want people to get along I</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="4.44">want people to be able to settle down</text>
  <text start="393.64" dur="4.649">and build cities and roads and bridges</text>

  <text start="400.21" dur="6.72">you know universities and farmland I</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="4.681">want people to get along I really want a</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="5.459">single state solution here in Israel and</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="5.55">what that means is that we just include</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="4.231">these people so it would just mean that</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="4.91">the Gaza Strip see this little dotted</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="4.71">line right here see these dotted lines</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="5.56">it just means that we would just make</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="5.459">those go away they&amp;#39;re not real that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="5.97">what Google is telling us you know</text>
  <text start="426.789" dur="5.85">Jordan has solid lines look here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="3.69">edge of its country these lines right</text>
  <text start="432.639" dur="3.991">here is the edge of Jordan Israel</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t have borders and here&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="436.63" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want to define them either they</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="5.039">want to they want to make illegal</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="5.4">settlements in the West Bank and they</text>
  <text start="443.229" dur="4.591">want to continue to Ketel everybody that</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="5.75">was stuck in this little box when they</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="8.37">changed the lines so I mean understand</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="7.03">this is new this area this all used to</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="5.039">be area called Palestine all of it and</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="5.61">then it was broken into pieces after the</text>
  <text start="461.229" dur="6.12">fall of the Ottoman Empire right during</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="7.11">like the start of World War one so this</text>
  <text start="467.349" dur="6.091">is only like this whole development he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="5.04">only like a hundred years old 50 years</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="5.159">old in some spots 20-30 years old in</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="3.24">other spots these dotted lines the</text>
  <text start="478.599" dur="3.181">reason why they have them dotted is</text>
  <text start="479.83" dur="4.619">because they keep changing and they know</text>
  <text start="481.78" dur="3.96">that you know ten years from now</text>
  <text start="484.449" dur="4.921">hopefully they&amp;#39;re gonna get these dotted</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="5.25">lines to be smaller not bigger you know</text>
  <text start="489.37" dur="3.84">we got to keep smashing it in and</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="4.08">smashing it in eventually these people</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="3.15">won&amp;#39;t have anywhere to go and then they</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="3.98">can just be you know I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="6.23">the endgame is do you just kill them all</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="6.31">because there&amp;#39;s people in these areas</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="4.21">right there&amp;#39;s people in there that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="4.2">weird thing there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="5.76">people in there and they keep making it</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="5.88">smaller and smaller on purpose and no</text>
  <text start="512.56" dur="4.409">one does anything about it and there was</text>
  <text start="515.44" dur="5.099">a vote look at this real quick I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="516.969" dur="5.551">get off the map and when you talk about</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="3.871">why isn&amp;#39;t Palestine a country you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="6.09">all kinds of weird answers from people</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="6.54">the short the real answer okay to get to</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="4.2">the point is Palestine isn&amp;#39;t a country</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="2.97">because Israel doesn&amp;#39;t want it to be a</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="3.719">country</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="5.37">percent and when you go read things like</text>
  <text start="536.529" dur="6.081">the UN Palestine vote okay what comes up</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="4.47">under Wikipedia is you know 1947 stuff</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="6.849">okay</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="8.79">but if you type in 2012 you won&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="549.459" dur="3.841">it predictive text see there&amp;#39;s the US</text>

  <text start="566.38" dur="4.889">find it a predictive text I think this</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="6.209">might be it let&amp;#39;s go look at here and</text>
  <text start="571.269" dur="5.911">Wikipedia I&amp;#39;m doing this real time so I</text>
  <text start="575.949" dur="3.841">think this is the vote where they were</text>

  <text start="595.72" dur="7.109">to a non-member observer state status in</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="4.919">the United Nations so they were not</text>
  <text start="602.829" dur="3.69">going to get to join you in in voting</text>
  <text start="604.329" dur="5.101">but they were gonna be recognized as as</text>
  <text start="606.519" dur="4.231">a statehood right now Palestine is</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="3.469">nothing you don&amp;#39;t understand that they</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="5.449">don&amp;#39;t have anything they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="639.64" dur="6.3">it so the world said yeah let&amp;#39;s do that</text>

  <text start="648" dur="5.05">five people didn&amp;#39;t show up but nine</text>
  <text start="650.769" dur="4.411">people nine people voted against it and</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="6.539">because nine people voted against it it</text>
  <text start="655.18" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t pass now the interesting part let</text>
  <text start="659.589" dur="4.921">me go down here you&amp;#39;ll just see who</text>
  <text start="661.18" dur="6.39">voted against it so here&amp;#39;s the company</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="8.54">here&amp;#39;s the countries that rejected it</text>
  <text start="667.57" dur="9.42">Canada Czech Republic Micronesia Israel</text>
  <text start="673.05" dur="6.82">Marshall Islands Naru Pulu Panama in the</text>
  <text start="676.99" dur="6.8">US the United States of America so the</text>
  <text start="679.87" dur="9.36">United States Canada and Israel said no</text>
  <text start="683.79" dur="9.82">there&amp;#39;s the vote now remember the United</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="6.27">States we have 13 we have 13 senators</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="4.77">who are all of the Democratic Party who</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="4.98">have dual Israeli citizenship and we</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="4.53">have something like 27 House of Reps</text>
  <text start="700.48" dur="5.01">all with dual Israeli citizenship Israel</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="6.63">runs Israel runs our Congress this is</text>
  <text start="705.49" dur="6.92">the UN vote but you know Israel Israeli</text>
  <text start="709.54" dur="6.57">citizens occupy 10% of the United States</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="8.77">American Congress that writes our laws</text>
  <text start="716.11" dur="8.76">so basically Canada is a lot of the same</text>
  <text start="721.18" dur="5.88">I imagine I&amp;#39;m just guessing so Israel is</text>
  <text start="724.87" dur="5.579">the one who said Palestinians can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="727.06" dur="5.1">recognized as a country now my guess on</text>
  <text start="730.449" dur="3.601">this is because they don&amp;#39;t want they</text>
  <text start="732.16" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t want these things these dotted</text>
  <text start="734.05" dur="4.909">lines they don&amp;#39;t want them becoming</text>
  <text start="736" dur="5.22">solid and that would be bad for them I</text>
  <text start="738.959" dur="3.911">think long term they want these dotted</text>
  <text start="741.22" dur="3.09">lines to get smaller and smaller they</text>
  <text start="742.87" dur="3.54">wanted mushrik and shrink and it would</text>
  <text start="744.31" dur="4.05">be better if they could balkanize it so</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="3.989">bust this up into small little pieces</text>
  <text start="748.36" dur="3.779">that aren&amp;#39;t connected with each other so</text>
  <text start="750.399" dur="4.711">that maybe Israel could control all the</text>
  <text start="752.139" dur="5.461">roads right and then the West Bank would</text>
  <text start="755.11" dur="4.58">be busted into you know 10 or 12</text>
  <text start="757.6" dur="4.979">different districts and they&amp;#39;d all be</text>
  <text start="759.69" dur="5.86">separated and then they could run</text>
  <text start="762.579" dur="5.31">roadblocks between them if you want to</text>
  <text start="765.55" dur="4.769">watch the videos go look at Jewish or</text>
  <text start="767.889" dur="3.75">Israeli road blocks on Palestinians it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.319" dur="2.64">amazing it&amp;#39;s how they caused all the</text>
  <text start="771.639" dur="4.621">conflict it&amp;#39;s how they go in and kill</text>
  <text start="772.959" dur="5.07">some kids you know they they go occupy</text>
  <text start="776.26" dur="3.03">someone&amp;#39;s little neighborhood and then</text>
  <text start="778.029" dur="2.75">the people come out and they throw some</text>
  <text start="779.29" dur="3.659">rocks and they shoot them with bullets</text>
  <text start="780.779" dur="7.441">it&amp;#39;s amazing that they get away with it</text>
  <text start="782.949" dur="7.26">and the UN wants to go do humanitarian</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="3.969">peacekeeping missions down in places</text>
  <text start="790.209" dur="4.98">like the Gaza Strip and Israel says no</text>
  <text start="792.189" dur="4.65">and because Israel has a you know are</text>
  <text start="795.189" dur="4.71">they part of the Security Council on the</text>
  <text start="796.839" dur="4.291">UN I think so because they occupy a key</text>
  <text start="799.899" dur="6.001">position they</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="6.81">just do whatever they want now</text>
  <text start="805.9" dur="5.1">look here I&amp;#39;ll get this in before we</text>
  <text start="807.94" dur="7.95">leave so Lebanon this is the land of</text>
  <text start="811" dur="7.71">cane Canaan and Lebanon its capital is</text>
  <text start="815.89" dur="5.01">Beirut now for some of you this may</text>
  <text start="818.71" dur="7.68">sound familiar Beirut is a very famous</text>
  <text start="820.9" dur="7.62">place and it&amp;#39;s because you know about 20</text>
  <text start="826.39" dur="4.2">years after Israel got statehood they</text>
  <text start="828.52" dur="4.17">started expanding these these battle</text>
  <text start="830.59" dur="4.59">lines that dotted line started changing</text>
  <text start="832.69" dur="3.95">and the first thing they had to do is</text>
  <text start="835.18" dur="5.97">make sure that Lebanon was D</text>
  <text start="836.64" dur="6.16">destabilized so if you go look up Beirut</text>
  <text start="841.15" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;ll find that there was a civil war</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="5.1">and then there was also a 1982 Lebanon</text>
  <text start="844.87" dur="7.32">War these are both in Lebanon and the</text>
  <text start="847.9" dur="8.19">civil war lasted 15 years killed 120,000</text>
  <text start="852.19" dur="6.27">people in in 2012 okay this is now there</text>
  <text start="856.09" dur="4.8">were still 76,000 people that remain</text>
  <text start="858.46" dur="7.5">displays within Lebanon it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="860.89" dur="7.35">war zone so that&amp;#39;s what happened here so</text>
  <text start="865.96" dur="4.38">when you look you realize that anybody</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="4.29">who shares a border with Israel doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="870.34" dur="6.39">have a chance you know they&amp;#39;ll either</text>
  <text start="872.53" dur="6.12">there they&amp;#39;ll either a Ketel you and put</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="3.75">increasing pressure over beating you up</text>
  <text start="878.65" dur="3.96">and smashing your stuff down and killing</text>
  <text start="880.48" dur="5.01">you or they&amp;#39;ll destroy you from within</text>
  <text start="882.61" dur="4.02">with civil war and displacement and now</text>
  <text start="885.49" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re seeing them do the same thing</text>
  <text start="886.63" dur="6.93">with North Africa and the flood of</text>
  <text start="889.27" dur="6.33">people hitting Europe I&amp;#39;m out of time</text>
