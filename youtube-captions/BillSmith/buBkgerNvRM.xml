  <text start="106.259" dur="5.311">person to say that online and I had</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="3.48">never done a news channel I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="3.689">have a youtube I didn&amp;#39;t even know what</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.14">YouTube was really I watched YouTube</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.161">stuff but I never uploaded a video I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="4.68">never done social media I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.32">have a background in journalism I just</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="3.57">read a lot of news so this stuff started</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="3.15">to get to the point where it didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="4.049">any sense and I was like no one is</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="6.09">saying what I want to say you know say</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="7.741">the thing that is true so I made a video</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="5.369">no one watched it I got like 300 views</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="3.599">but a month later I stumbled on the</text>
  <text start="139.349" dur="5.61">queue and on in like January and here we</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="7.831">are in August first I have been</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="8.581">mentioned on oh man I got I got</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="7.919">mentioned on CNN they played my voice on</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="6.449">The Today show this morning I&amp;#39;m on the</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="4.771">Washington Post MSNBC not me</text>

  <text start="161.73" dur="6.39">they they show screenshots of YouTube</text>
  <text start="165.019" dur="4.36">over and over and over so this is what</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="3.92">I&amp;#39;ve been trying to tell people from the</text>
  <text start="169.379" dur="6.871">get-go okay YouTube is ground zero</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="7.24">YouTube is difficult to get started on</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s difficult to make videos it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.23">harder than making a Facebook post or</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="5.82">sharing a tweet so YouTube is where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="5.369">at and YouTube there&amp;#39;s a power and video</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="3.75">that you can&amp;#39;t get anywhere else in any</text>
  <text start="188.879" dur="3.72">kind of media newspapers are dead</text>

  <text start="249.84" dur="4.979">the blue check box okay the land of the</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="6.36">blue check box has now hit the queue on</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="9.631">search and this signals this signals</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="9">that the independent media citizen</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="10.23">journalism is coming to a head</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="9">and overtaking mainstream paid media so</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="4.73">media designed to make money or protect</text>
  <text start="276.9" dur="4.769">monetary interests or power interests</text>
  <text start="279.41" dur="5.56">like the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="6.03">you know owned by Jeff Bezos right or</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="4.71">MSNBC which was in partnership with</text>

  <text start="297.63" dur="3.39">ago I&amp;#39;m telling you this is this is the</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="4.38">moment you know I this is like a</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="4.47">personal journal for me a diary I worked</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="4.739">really hard to get here I put out a</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="5.22">hundred and fifty-six videos alright I</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="3.451">fought with like eight different people</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="4.829">it took a tremendous amount of heat</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="7.859">online but now for some reason they</text>
  <text start="315.539" dur="8.221">chose one video that I made one video to</text>
  <text start="319.979" dur="6.091">pop like the the balloon was getting</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="4.32">built up the pressure was building I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="3.27">not the one that filled the balloon you</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="3.57">understand like I&amp;#39;m not taking credit</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="3.6">for that I was definitely one of the</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="3.63">people passing the balloon around</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="7.199">putting air in it you know that was me</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="7.74">I had a channel dedicated to this but</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="4.351">when it came down to it it was something</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="3.09">I just totally didn&amp;#39;t expect I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="3.899">know why Tom Hanks would be the guy that</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="3.9">popped the bubble popped the balloon and</text>
  <text start="348.389" dur="5.521">made mainstream media start addressing</text>
  <text start="350.01" dur="6.36">this now I I want to show you something</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="4.289">I wrote this so first they ignore you</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="5.519">then they laugh at you then they fight</text>
  <text start="358.199" dur="7.351">you then we win so we were here for a</text>
  <text start="361.889" dur="8.041">long time ten fifteen years right</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="5.76">but around like 2018 they became aware</text>
  <text start="369.93" dur="4.89">of queue and on and they were like it</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="5.31">was in the background and then we kind</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="3">of passed it right and then we we</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="3.06">entered this stage where they just kind</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="3.27">of ridiculed us in passing they it</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.019">dropped feed little hints here and there</text>
  <text start="381.09" dur="4.139">across the mainstream media drip feed</text>
  <text start="383.699" dur="4.611">you know every once while you get an</text>
  <text start="385.229" dur="6.87">article people would find it but today</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="6.85">today is a new day because as of</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="7.44">yesterday we&amp;#39;re past that stage we not</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="6.63">we are now in the fight okay years</text>
  <text start="399.539" dur="4.831">you&amp;#39;re watching you&amp;#39;re watching the</text>
  <text start="401.79" dur="5.28">beginning stages of a full weight of a</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="4.53">media blitz targeted at something they</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="4.83">never wanted to address they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="6.3">to say it okay this is just me talking</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="5.52">to myself but the reason why I want Tom</text>
  <text start="415.2" dur="3.93">Hanks to see those videos is because I</text>
  <text start="417.42" dur="5.3">want him to respond and say I didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="419.13" dur="5.88">that I want him to to deny it you know</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="3.52">so that&amp;#39;s what the mainstream media did</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="3.15">they ignored us for a really long time</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="3.39">and now they won&amp;#39;t do it now with that</text>
  <text start="428.16" dur="3.5">that ship is sailed</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="5.34">they went as long as they could without</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="5.86">popping that balloon and then the funny</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="4.65">this is the ironic part at the end of it</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s lift the veil lifts you understand</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="3.72">that you know you understand how ironic</text>
