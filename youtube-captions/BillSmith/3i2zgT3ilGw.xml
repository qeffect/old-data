  <text start="202.14" dur="4.47">arranged for lieutenant general Flynn to</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="3.72">swear into federal court if the facts</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="3.51">are inconsistent with the plea agreement</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="6.9">that would be entirely different kettle</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="6.209">of fish third as both the committee&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="252.57" dur="4.8">inconsistent with the plea agreement</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="5.069">however it would absolutely be in the</text>

  <text start="271.74" dur="5.76">prosecutors and a defendant have agreed</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="6.66">to describe publicly this is no ordinary</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="6.12">criminal case it is at the heart of a</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="6.03">political firestorm over the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="5.84">alleged statements about it - former FBI</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="4.86">director whom he later dismissed</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="4.96">Congress has a right to know the full</text>

  <text start="294.42" dur="3.15">the facts are consistent with the plea</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="4.44">agreement there is absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="5.66">for the department to hide and no reason</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.49">to act like it has something to hide</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="5.5">resisting congressional oversight only</text>
  <text start="306" dur="3.75">serves to further undermine public trust</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="4.41">in the department</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="5.61">by contrast cooperation could enhance</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="4.26">public trust in the department by</text>

  <text start="450.72" dur="5.49">White House Counsel as described by the</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.35">president&amp;#39;s attorneys do not seem to</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="5.13">square with the current popular</text>

  <text start="463.71" dur="5.94">FBI&amp;#39;s conduct here is ripe for</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.91">congressional oversight finally it is</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="4.47">disingenuous and extremely disturbing</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="5.37">that the department would imply that a</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="7.2">request to interview a fact witness such</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="8.81">as Special Agent Pitka</text>
  <text start="481.32" dur="7.74">that&amp;#39;s P ie in TKA has anything</text>
  <text start="486.14" dur="5.79">whatsoever to do with quote allegations</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="5.82">against that witness as you well know</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="6.43">seeking information from a fact witness</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="5.7">is not the same thing as an allegation</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="6.03">of wrongdoing quite the contrary it</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="6.51">seems he is likely to be an objective</text>
  <text start="504.39" dur="4.44">reliable and trustworthy witness which</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="5.97">is precisely why the committee would</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="6.81">benefit from his testimony moreover you</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="4.59">also know very well that I am committed</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="4.68">to transparency in the committee&amp;#39;s work</text>
  <text start="517.65" dur="4.8">and for that reason I generally post all</text>
