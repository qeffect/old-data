  <text start="0.29" dur="9.429">hi welcome I was headed to bed again</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="8.249">late something popped up and I saw that</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="7.23">a commenter had put something slightly</text>
  <text start="13.469" dur="6.48">cryptic into the comments below in a</text>
  <text start="16.949" dur="5.971">previous video so I went and checked</text>
  <text start="19.949" dur="5.461">this phrase out on a search and I first</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="6.54">search on DuckDuckGo and this is the</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="6">search page that I had and when I went</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="8.189">and searched on Google there was only</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="11.19">one there was only one returned search</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="6.84">result and then about an hour later this</text>
  <text start="42.6" dur="5.88">pop back up where it had two million</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="9.031">searches for two million results so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="7.53">confused how that happens so it made me</text>
  <text start="53.52" dur="8.82">look about what what was on here and</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="7.65">what was being listed as you can see it</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="7.26">doesn&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="8.16">any matches there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no matches</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="5.699">anywhere on the search page but but what</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="8.22">does come up is about trained developers</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="7.171">failing to oversee key work officials</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="6.54">who failed to oversee Texas juveniles</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="7.98">disciplined Fannie and Freddie the</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="9.42">housing scandal civil liability and</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="7.379">criminal justice so it kind of links to</text>
  <text start="96" dur="4.11">a lot of different stuff but I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="97.829" dur="5.97">to get to the what I think is the more</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="9.89">important part this set of search</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="10.441">results showcases how the British Empire</text>
  <text start="110" dur="10.45">colonial eyes the world throughout this</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="8.909">time period right here but on Google the</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="4.739">only search result that showed up the</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="6.36">first time that I checked for this just</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="7.281">about an hour ago this was what was this</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="2.961">was what was showing</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="8.28">and it has to do with the sentiment of</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="8.64">the Democratic Party during the second</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="6.69">term of the Bush administration now we</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="5.03">were in war at war in Iraq and it was</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="5.64">very unpopular everybody hated it and</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="5.62">this article I&amp;#39;m not sure how reliable</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="5.61">it is I don&amp;#39;t know what the source is</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="5.13">but it says that 86% of the people</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="4.59">polled in the first 24 hours of this</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="4.38">poll were in favor of immediate</text>
  <text start="163.31" dur="3">impeachment for the President and Vice</text>
  <text start="165.02" dur="11.18">President of the United States of</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="13.47">America now why this is relevant is</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="7.24">because the Democrats were in power in</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="13.95">both houses so in the house and the</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="13.29">Senate during 2008 so if we look at this</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="3.87">this is the control of the US Senate and</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="8.7">House of Reps</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="10.2">and down here 2008 wearing this blue</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="5.1">band that goes all the way up they have</text>
  <text start="207.8" dur="6.63">both they have both House and the Senate</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="6.81">and this is the plan the plan was always</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="4.8">to keep the house in control of the</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="5.48">opposite party on the foot flop that way</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s difficult to ram things through and</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="6.1">at the same time you advance the agenda</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="6.72">from both sides of the table it&amp;#39;s sneaky</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="6.06">and backhanded so you have an unpopular</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="7.199">war you have everybody in the Democratic</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="10.13">Party wanting impeachment and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="8.041">do it so why would they not do it now</text>
  <text start="245.11" dur="4.15">everybody&amp;#39;s talking about Feinstein</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="4.7">right now some bad things are about to</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="2.69">happen to her</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="6.28">but this is some more things about the</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="5.669">point of view that she has so this is</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="4.68">affecting our immigration right now</text>
