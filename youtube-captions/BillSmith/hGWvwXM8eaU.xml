  <text start="0.03" dur="5.1">hey how you doing I&amp;#39;m bill Smith and I</text>
  <text start="3.27" dur="4.71">wanted to tell you about the new</text>
  <text start="5.13" dur="5.79">consumer Internet Bill of Rights that</text>
  <text start="7.98" dur="4.68">AT&amp;amp;T is proposing now not going to pull</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="4.11">up the post but there was a queue post a</text>
  <text start="12.66" dur="6.119">few days ago talking about how the NSA</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="7.169">just signed a new contract with AT&amp;amp;T to</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="5.461">push this internet bill of rights and if</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;ve been following the queue excuse</text>
  <text start="24.24" dur="3.6">me if you&amp;#39;ve been following queue I</text>
  <text start="26.039" dur="4.32">think it&amp;#39;s always good for us whenever</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re up to something so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="30.359" dur="5.001">gonna tell you a couple things that I</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="5.759">saw in here that were really important</text>
  <text start="35.36" dur="4.539">the first part of the article is kind of</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="4.081">a set up but we get down to here and it</text>
  <text start="39.899" dur="3.121">says AT&amp;amp;T is committed to an open</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="3">Internet</text>
  <text start="43.02" dur="5.19">we don&amp;#39;t block websites we don&amp;#39;t censor</text>
  <text start="45.48" dur="4.44">online content and I think this is the</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="5.099">important part of the conversation that</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.77">people need to focus on it also says</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="3.09">they don&amp;#39;t throttle discriminator</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.56">degrade network performance based on</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="6.75">content period now the net neutrality</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="6.81">rules that were just rescinded I guess</text>
  <text start="63.149" dur="6.271">are taken taken away I was originally</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.34">for but I was for it because there was a</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="4.65">huge push by all the content companies</text>
  <text start="71.4" dur="4.89">like Google and Facebook to get in that</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="3.63">neutrality push and I thought that was</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="2.55">really strange at the time but I also</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="4.59">thought it was great that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="5.34">throw out all my content right so I was</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="7.86">definitely a net neutrality supporter</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="7.53">but when I figured out that written into</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="4.649">that law codified into that law is</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="5.159">basically restrictions on the cable</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.86">companies so the internet providers</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="5.131">can&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t do anything to the content</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="6">providers but the content providers are</text>
  <text start="102" dur="5.22">not included in that agreement so Google</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="3.361">and Facebook can say hey look we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="5.67">private companies and were unregulated</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="5.489">unregulated but so that means that we</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="5.339">can censor all the content that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="5.851">like or we can shadow ban you or we can</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="4.231">deactivate your account or de platform</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="6.18">you or really do whatever we want and</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="5.7">this is a problem I mean clearly it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="3.329">problem and it&amp;#39;s a bigger problem</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="5.49">outside the United States we&amp;#39;re lucky</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="5.581">we&amp;#39;re extremely lucky so 18 t now</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="3.929">what the NSA is saying look you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.59">you can&amp;#39;t censor people&amp;#39;s views now so</text>
  <text start="137.579" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s where this is headed and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="3.839">why net neutrality was repealed so</text>
  <text start="142.769" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re gonna replace it now with an</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="6.541">Internet Bill of Rights that applies to</text>
  <text start="147.51" dur="4.91">all Internet companies and guarantees</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="3.78">neutrality transparency openness</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="3.58">non-discrimination and privacy</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="4.95">protection for all Internet users and</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.879">this is why Google and Facebook and</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="4.709">Twitter don&amp;#39;t want it the entire media</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="5.22">conglomeration is going to be against it</text>
  <text start="163.859" dur="7.561">and if you&amp;#39;ve if you read anything about</text>
  <text start="167.099" dur="6.36">the Davos meeting with with Trump over</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="4.739">there right now they&amp;#39;re doing a huge</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="6.78">push to punish Facebook and Google to</text>
  <text start="176.159" dur="6.991">censor more in their companies so this</text>
  <text start="180.239" dur="5.931">is important we need this and anybody</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="5.28">who tells you this isn&amp;#39;t in our favor is</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="5.289">they&amp;#39;re the enemy I mean that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.889">that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;ve gotten to I was wrong</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="3.42">on that neutrality originally I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="193.319" dur="3.301">realize what I was getting myself into I</text>
  <text start="194.879" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t read the law you know I just I</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="7.35">knew I wanted fairness and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="199.079" dur="6.711">what we got so to show you what the</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="4.29">media push on this is going to be like</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="4.479">this is just a quick search for 18t</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="4.5">Internet Bill of Rights this is a</text>
  <text start="210.269" dur="3.44">variety and TechCrunch both of them are</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="4.53">against it</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="5.2">spoiler alert as a matter of fact like</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="5.25">the entire first page is against it</text>
  <text start="218.909" dur="5.67">almost it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="3.479">some some of these have neutral</text>
  <text start="224.579" dur="3.3">headlines but when you get into read the</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="4.351">article they give you a lot of reasons</text>
  <text start="227.879" dur="4.17">against it and they point out how 18t</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="2.78">was against net neutrality in the first</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="3.991">place</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="4.869">so people now are talking about</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="6.36">bandwidth restrictions and tiered</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="5.881">approach but 18 t zone their own</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="2.85">admission and their own guarantee from</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="2.91">what we just read says that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re not committed to that at all</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="3.149">and I don&amp;#39;t think these networks are</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.35">slow anymore this is a problem ten years</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="5.761">ago maybe but not now we don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="5.309">have bandwidth problems anymore plus a</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="3.81">lot of things are mobile so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="257.849" dur="3.121">going to cover this article I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="3.93">skip over this TechCrunch this is the</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="4.319">second one and it&amp;#39;s saying how it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="3.99">power play against Google and Facebook</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="5.131">but AT&amp;amp;T does</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="6.03">not compete with Google on Facebook and</text>
  <text start="270.42" dur="5.04">I want to point something out the most</text>
  <text start="273.48" dur="4.74">that people can complain about AT&amp;amp;T is</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="6.33">overcharging you okay everybody&amp;#39;s had a</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="5.25">bad bill I understand that but I can</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="3.39">complain all day about Google and</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="4.71">Facebook in any kind of social media</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="4.62">that won&amp;#39;t want me on it or what what</text>
  <text start="288.18" dur="3.87">you want it you know or won&amp;#39;t let you</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.6">share a post or when you share a post</text>

  <text start="293.4" dur="2.96">idea so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re gonna make sure none</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="5.25">of your friends see this</text>

  <text start="300.36" dur="4.13">not come they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t compete</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="4.8">with these social media platforms I</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="4.39">think the social media platforms are far</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="4.83">more powerful the companies are far</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="6.78">bigger than these than the backbone</text>
