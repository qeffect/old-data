  <text start="0.06" dur="4.38">hey what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s bill Smith</text>
  <text start="2.3" dur="4.12">before we get started if you&amp;#39;re new to</text>
  <text start="4.44" dur="6.42">this conversation I have a message from</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="7.65">Q we&amp;#39;re waiting on this FISA report I</text>
  <text start="10.86" dur="5.04">guess from Congress so I&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="14.07" dur="4.2">that in a second but we have to mention</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="3.86">it over and over and over because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="4.05">been waiting for it for months</text>
  <text start="19.76" dur="7.29">supposedly it&amp;#39;s just around the corner</text>
  <text start="22.32" dur="8.879">and we&amp;#39;re supposed to mention that so</text>
  <text start="27.05" dur="10.12">today is August 14th 2018 and this is Q</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="8.911">post 1876 it says Gmail drafts that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="37.17" dur="7.549">the first line so before I even read the</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="9.33">rest this post what they mean by this is</text>
  <text start="44.719" dur="7.081">when you log into Gmail and you start to</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="5.07">send something like you draft an email</text>
  <text start="51.8" dur="7.09">but you never send it it just sits in</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="6.209">there they used the same account and</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="5.43">they had log in and they would see the</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="5.01">previous draft so like I&amp;#39;m just taking a</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="3.51">guess here I don&amp;#39;t know who the major</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="4.051">players were I think it was probably</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="5.19">Obama Hillary Clinton people like that</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="5.4">but they all had similar addresses and</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.55">they would log in to the same address so</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="5.759">like Hillary and Obama maybe shared an</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="6.26">address and Hillary would log in and</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="6.601">she&amp;#39;d write a bunch of stuff and then</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="4.77">Hillary would let someone else log in</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="6.45">from somewhere else and read that draft</text>
  <text start="89.6" dur="7.03">so that way the message never gets sent</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="6.15">across the wire it never gets picked up</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="5.82">by routers it never gets sniffed on you</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.979">know by the by the operators in the</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="5.099">United States and likely it was probably</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="4.021">hosted overseas although it&amp;#39;s Gmail so</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="4.081">it probably doesn&amp;#39;t matter no one no one</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.619">thought they&amp;#39;d ever find it anyway</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="5.669">Google safeguarded this stuff at the</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="7.47">highest level access level 3 at Google</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="5.82">server routing non-us based so I just</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="3.24">said that they didn&amp;#39;t even they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="1.741">even bring this across the wire over</text>
  <text start="124.469" dur="5.13">there</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="7.44">so when you logged into Google you were</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="4.271">probably connected to a server somewhere</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="4.73">across</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="5.35">the united states boundary singapore or</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="5.19">something and that message sits there</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="6.69">and a place where no one can ever get to</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="5.4">it no government will ever reach it you</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="3.24">know it&amp;#39;s probably safeguarded by</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="3.75">Google&amp;#39;s security over in another</text>
  <text start="149.15" dur="4.89">country so they have it really really</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="4.56">tightly locked and then like I said all</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;d have to do is log in leave a</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="3.93">message log out and then let somebody</text>
  <text start="158.599" dur="3.72">else from somewhere else in the world</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.62">they could be working an NGO another</text>
  <text start="162.319" dur="3.601">government agency somewhere else it</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="3.69">could just be a regular citizen out</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="3.96">doing some work and another company you</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="3.72">know they just let those other people</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="3.93">log in to those accounts and they read</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="4.379">the gmail drafts they could make a</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="4.7">different gmail account for each each</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="4.711">message you know that&amp;#39;s a possibility</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="9.1">but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how Google dealt with</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="9.599">this so highest level of security so the</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="7.019">sample the sample I&amp;#39;m gonna give you is</text>
  <text start="190.579" dur="7.47">this so this guy was fired back in 2012</text>
  <text start="194.629" dur="5.341">he was a four-star general and he got</text>
  <text start="198.049" dur="4.56">fired because he got caught in an</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.22">extramarital affair which is funny</text>
  <text start="202.609" dur="5.1">because now we allow I don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="205.19" dur="6.96">edgy okay I&amp;#39;ll just let that one go but</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="6.661">he was a four-star general he was having</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="3.449">an affair with his biographer so this</text>
  <text start="214.37" dur="1.8">like journalist that was writing a book</text>
  <text start="215.599" dur="3.931">about him</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="5.939">and they caught him and this is how they</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="4.95">caught him and it doesn&amp;#39;t talk about it</text>
  <text start="222.109" dur="4.981">here in Wikipedia but I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="4.979">that&amp;#39;s exactly how they caught him he</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="4.679">was logging in leaving draft messages</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="4.801">and she was logging in and reading them</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="5.25">and they were they were communicating by</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="5.509">using the same gmail account and leaving</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="2.75">draft emails</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="7.74">so on November 7th 2012 Petraeus General</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="7.17">Petraeus tendered his resignation as CIA</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="7.35">chief to President Obama per the</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="7.29">directive from James clapper so James</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="6.96">clapper one of this guy out and by all</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="6.45">accounts I think betray us I mean I saw</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="3.9">a bunch of memes on the Chan&amp;#39;s and I</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t know if they were they were true</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.44">or not you know Petraeus Petraeus I</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t know I thought he was a good guy I</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="5.79">could be wrong I don&amp;#39;t know much about</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="6">him but it&amp;#39;s kind of up in the air he</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="5.37">pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.76">of mishandling classified materials he</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="10.14">was given a two-year probationary period</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="9.48">and a fine of $100,000 crazy okay so</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a good sample that I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="4.74">give you right there so then it talks</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="5.97">about wet work now here&amp;#39;s where it gets</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="8.34">interesting if this is true so wet work</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="7.26">is like a hit job so it originally meant</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="5.6">robbery that involved murder or the</text>

  <text start="482.099" dur="3.931">and here&amp;#39;s the important part</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="6.271">okay it says why does it Eric Schmidt</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="9.379">make public NSA classified tools</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="5.659">I think xkeyscore and prism specifically</text>
  <text start="496.05" dur="7.19">okay now xkeyscore is a formally secret</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="7.169">computer system first used by the US</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="6.399">National Security Agency for searching</text>
  <text start="506.819" dur="5.041">and analyzing global Internet data which</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="5.52">it collects on a daily basis you know</text>
  <text start="511.86" dur="5.13">what that sounds like that sounds like</text>
  <text start="515.159" dur="5.61">Google that sounds like what I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="6.089">right now to find xkeyscore down here</text>
  <text start="520.769" dur="8.671">it&amp;#39;s got some more stuff too what is gum</text>
  <text start="523.079" dur="9.111">fish gum fish takes over the devices web</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="4.709">cam and can film or take photographs</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="6.43">might want to put a piece of tape in</text>
  <text start="534.149" dur="6.271">front of your webcam but NSA prism prism</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="3.959">is a codename for a program under which</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="4.71">the United States National Security</text>
  <text start="542.579" dur="5.401">Agency the NSA collects Internet</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="6.149">communications from various US Internet</text>
  <text start="547.98" dur="7.109">companies the program is also known by</text>
  <text start="551.279" dur="9.961">this program named sig add u.s. 984 -</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="8.49">sorry - 984 X n whoo okay</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="5.07">so why was this tech kept from elected</text>
  <text start="563.579" dur="5.161">officials I imagine it has to do with a</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="3.839">government oversight and I also think it</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="3.45">probably has to do with what they can</text>
  <text start="570.149" dur="3.601">and can&amp;#39;t do like they can just hand it</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="2.91">over they can go put it in another</text>
  <text start="573.75" dur="6.089">country and do whatever they want with</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="6.929">it if the United States government owned</text>
  <text start="579.839" dur="4.411">it there&amp;#39;d be like a bureaucratic</text>
  <text start="582.029" dur="4.5">process and some kind of oversight</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="4.829">somewhere and you can totally get around</text>
  <text start="586.529" dur="5.581">that with the corporation corporations</text>
  <text start="589.079" dur="5.88">have to like mine their trading laws SEC</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="5.88">rules and you know they can&amp;#39;t break the</text>
  <text start="594.959" dur="6.44">law but the laws are much more relaxed</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="3.409">for what they can they can accomplish</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="4.77">why was the NSA created</text>
  <text start="611.209" dur="7.12">so the president harry s truman truman</text>
  <text start="615.949" dur="5.68">authorized the creation of the NSA in a</text>
  <text start="618.329" dur="6.87">letter he wrote in 1952</text>
  <text start="621.629" dur="5.911">so that is after world war ii which</text>
  <text start="625.199" dur="4.411">itself remained classified for decades</text>
  <text start="627.54" dur="4.889">it was formally established through a</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="6.86">revised revision of National Security</text>
  <text start="632.429" dur="9.871">Council intelligence directive 9 on</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="7.929">October 24th 1952 ok now the purpose of</text>

  <text start="644.399" dur="7.98">agency under the authority of the</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="4.5">Director of National Intelligence the</text>

  <text start="661.1" dur="7.239">purposes specializing in a discipline</text>
  <text start="663.449" dur="6.93">known as signals intelligence sig int so</text>
  <text start="668.339" dur="7.321">if you see sig int they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="670.379" dur="7.26">talking about the NSA now since we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="4.83">here it says what&amp;#39;s the difference</text>
  <text start="677.639" dur="4.531">between the N the NSA and the CIA so</text>
  <text start="680.49" dur="5.939">says the main difference between the NSA</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="6.3">and the CIA FBI and this DIA revolves</text>
  <text start="686.429" dur="4.14">around how each agency gathers its</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="4.469">intelligence information the NSA does</text>
  <text start="690.569" dur="5.221">not have field agents who do in-person</text>
  <text start="692.939" dur="8.4">intelligence gathering so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="695.79" dur="7.08">have any like investigators really ok so</text>
  <text start="701.339" dur="6.961">that was all signals intelligence right</text>
  <text start="702.87" dur="9.93">there thanks sig int what advantages</text>
  <text start="708.3" dur="7.709">exist to big tech other ABC off/on</text>
