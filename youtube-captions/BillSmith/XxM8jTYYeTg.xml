  <text start="130.8" dur="7.31">illegitimate royal family bloodline</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="6.1">fathered by Nathan Mayer Rothschild now</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="3.75">that seems highly suspect and some</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="4.25">people will dismiss it the problem with</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="4.62">that is is she had a hereditary disease</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="6.07">called haemophilia</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="7.14">haemophilia be passed down only by</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="7.17">Jewish women and only to their male</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="5.67">heirs so here&amp;#39;s an article on Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="3.57">about it you can read about this I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="3.12">cover this in detail later I just want</text>
  <text start="161.24" dur="3.18">to drop it on your plate cuz you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="166.13" dur="4.83">legitimacy of Queen Victoria they say</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s not widely believed although it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.96" dur="6.3">totally true this was an illegitimate</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="6.57">woman once they got her fathered in</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="6.93">under weird circumstances her father and</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="5.58">her grandfather died in the same week so</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="4.44">they basically died before she was born</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="4.41">so she became an heir and then took over</text>
  <text start="188.63" dur="3.32">and then they made her have as many kids</text>
  <text start="190.25" dur="4.89">as possible with another Jewish man</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="5.74">these are the people they fathered royal</text>
  <text start="195.14" dur="5.4">lineages with throughout the 1800s this</text>
  <text start="197.69" dur="3.81">happened in the early 1800 1804 I think</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="4.17">it was right after the American</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="6.03">Revolution what&amp;#39;s crazy about it is this</text>
  <text start="204.71" dur="5.97">hemophilia problem is widespread</text>
