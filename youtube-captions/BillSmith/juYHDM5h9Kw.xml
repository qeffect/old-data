  <text start="0.05" dur="5.709">hey what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s Bill Smith</text>
  <text start="2.54" dur="5.559">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about the server okay</text>
  <text start="5.759" dur="3.871">what is the server we hear the server a</text>
  <text start="8.099" dur="3.741">lot in the cute post there&amp;#39;s been nine</text>
  <text start="9.63" dur="4.169">posts that mentioned the word server</text>
  <text start="11.84" dur="3.549">before we get started I&amp;#39;m going to clear</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="4.861">up a couple things so earlier in a</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="6.781">report today I put out I said that</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="5.31">Hoover reports to rod Rosen seen and</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="3.54">obviously that&amp;#39;s incorrect he reports</text>
  <text start="23.97" dur="4.049">the Jeff Sessions people were quick to</text>
  <text start="25.71" dur="5.85">point that out so thank you I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="28.019" dur="5.461">this before I&amp;#39;ll say it again I gave you</text>
  <text start="31.56" dur="3.659">a source you know there&amp;#39;s that was the</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.079">American Thinker it&amp;#39;s linked from the</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="4.321">Drudge Report all the time they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="4.171">only ones that had an article out there</text>
  <text start="39.54" dur="4.89">about who who burr actually reports to</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="5.34">so take it as you will</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="4.59">if Hoover reports directly to Jeff</text>
  <text start="47.07" dur="3.87">Sessions and that sounds like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s happening Jeff Sessions did</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="4.11">appoint him he does get regular updates</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="3.57">but Hoover&amp;#39;s kind of an enigma all right</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="3.239">there isn&amp;#39;t really a lot of mainstream</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="4.049">reports on it and if you say that he</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="4.711">reports the Jeff Sessions you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="4.341">off the queue posts rightfully so but I</text>
  <text start="63" dur="4.56">always try to match him up with</text>
  <text start="64.58" dur="4.48">mainstream media reports so the American</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.669">thinkers I thought it was a trustworthy</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="6.54">source turns out maybe it&amp;#39;s not also</text>
  <text start="72.229" dur="5.201">correction Tucker said that Podesta Tony</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="3.48">Podesta is not going to get offered</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="4.68">sorry he was going to get offered</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="7.1">immunity for testifying against Paul</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="6.299">Manafort now I said that that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="4.54">but there was another report that came</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="4.561">out today Fox News doubled down on that</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="3.84">position Tucker Carlson says it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="4.649">true their sources still say it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="5.19">to happen it&amp;#39;s just that Tony Podesta is</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.68">being offered limited immunity in</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.07">another case so a separate charge</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="4.021">against Paul Manafort there&amp;#39;s multiple</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="4.53">cases open and two different</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="6.75">jurisdictions so I just want to clarify</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="5.97">that okay but we were going to talk</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="4.32">about the server so there&amp;#39;s nine posts</text>
  <text start="115.32" dur="4.32">that mentioned the server most of the</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="4.68">conversation when we say hey you know</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="5.21">the server we think that&amp;#39;s the Hillary</text>
  <text start="122.07" dur="5.939">Clinton email server Seth</text>
  <text start="124.85" dur="5.17">at least that&amp;#39;s my that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where I</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="4.321">kind of Center the conversation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="5.01">what I&amp;#39;m most interested in but there</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="6.57">was also the John Podesta leak that was</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="10.25">a spearfishing hack off his gmail server</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="9.96">so the DNC Hillary Clinton John Podesta</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="5.679">all got different hacks okay it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="5.76">just one hack so it&amp;#39;s I want to clarify</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="9.901">that now I found a really good image</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="9.96">that at Liz just Liz posted what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="6.209">Liz and it&amp;#39;s a cute on post it says we</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="6">have it all so I wanted to take a look</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="5.551">at this and get this on record so the</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="3.87">infographic it&amp;#39;s a meme basically and it</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="6.06">says servers we know about and their</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="7.53">potential implications so hopefully this</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="8.46">will clarify the situation the first one</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="5.61">DNC server and this covers the seth rich</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="3.989">leak</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.039">so it says files transferred by seth</text>
  <text start="191.129" dur="3.841">rich to julian assange</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="4.021">and that&amp;#39;s like that you know that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s the sexy stuff you know</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="3.66">everybody&amp;#39;s all about that I want to</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="5.46">know this the ms-13 hit it says there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.58">two people you know I could actually</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="5.64">question an ms-13 story I really think</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="6">that getting ms-13 two people an ms-13</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="6.6">to create a hit and then killing them</text>
  <text start="211.89" dur="6.12">wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily cover that track it</text>
  <text start="216" dur="4.349">wouldn&amp;#39;t tie up that rope I think it&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="5.19">be safer to have a member of law</text>
  <text start="220.349" dur="5.521">enforcement or a hitman inside the FBI</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="4.74">you know they got him right it would</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="4.92">just be safer to have a registered</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="6.78">warranted hitman steal a gun out of that</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="6.54">FBI SUV and then you know clip seth rich</text>
  <text start="234.72" dur="4.469">and he would put down the phone if he</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="4.17">was approached by law enforcement you</text>
  <text start="239.189" dur="3.601">know i don&amp;#39;t think i think that he would</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="2.79">probably alert his girlfriend on the</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="5.04">phone if he was being approached by two</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="6.39">Mexicans with tattooed faces so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="5.129">saying that&amp;#39;s my guess that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.68">think I think Seth rich was targeted and</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="6.09">killed by government hitmen whether or</text>
  <text start="255.36" dur="6.059">not that was CIA FBI I don&amp;#39;t know I just</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.741">don&amp;#39;t think it was ms-13 so that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.321">my thought q says it was ms-13 so I want</text>
  <text start="263.79" dur="5.46">to make that clear q it on does say</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="4.92">it was an ms-13 hit okay so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="5.039">talking about servers though it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="270.66" dur="7.229">DNC server now this is the server that</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="6.271">the quote russians hacked okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="5.071">proof has proof of the DNC work to</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="4.979">ensure Bernie Sanders would never get</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="5.88">the nomination now the story goes at</text>
  <text start="285.539" dur="6.271">cetera learned that Bernie Sanders had</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="7.62">like 13 different primaries stolen from</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="7.28">him stolen okay and that has the email</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="4.889">where they talk about John Podesta</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="4.84">getting with the Soros company to cook</text>
  <text start="301.349" dur="5.281">the cook the servers to pre-program the</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="7.16">voting the voting machines you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="4.46">that email if not I&amp;#39;ll try to link it</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="5.26">okay so this is the the server that</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="4.65">caused debbie Wasserman Schultz to step</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="5.34">down it caused the DNC to lose a</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="4.889">class-action lawsuit for Bernie&amp;#39;s donate</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="3.03">donators so the people that donated to</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="6.09">Bernie Sanders think and they were</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="7.859">entering into a fair agreement they sued</text>
  <text start="329.909" dur="4.651">the DNC and one looks like and this was</text>
  <text start="332.759" dur="5.551">what was investigated by CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="7.47">now CrowdStrike is a Google backed</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="5.88">startup that the DNC hired to you know</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="5.33">quote-unquote do the investigation right</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="6.63">and this is what the FBI and James Comey</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="4.96">says this is why the FBI didn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="4.92">go take a look at it because CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="5.31">did it on their behalf now they never</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="4.26">looked at the actual machine what</text>
  <text start="357.63" dur="4.62">CrowdStrike provided was an image of the</text>
  <text start="360" dur="4.949">network and people say oh that&amp;#39;s better</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="4.71">but it&amp;#39;s not actual forensic evidence</text>
  <text start="364.949" dur="3.921">it&amp;#39;s a copy it could be anything so</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="4.949">that&amp;#39;s that story</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.75">now the next server on our list so the</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="4.56">second out of the four servers listed</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="6.69">here is the house Democratic caucus</text>
  <text start="376.469" dur="5.79">server now this is news to me but I know</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="3.8">the background on this now debbie</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="4.261">Wasserman Schultz comes back up in this</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="6.13">because this is the server that was</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="7.38">managed by her IT repair guy named Emran</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="7.26">a1 now you&amp;#39;ve seen Emmer nowand come up</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="5.62">on Trump Twitter tweets and Q on posts a</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="5.68">mérida one he</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="5.399">been kind of ghosted last reports say</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="4.62">that he was offered immunity for any</text>
  <text start="404.919" dur="4.291">nonviolent crimes that occurred before</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="3.63">so it looks like it was a blanket</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="4.44">immunity it looks like Emer no one has</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="4.68">turned Stace state&amp;#39;s witness at least</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="9.329">that&amp;#39;s the most recent update we got in</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="11.25">the news now worth mentioning I forgot</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="6.301">this but a one his wife fled the country</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="3.779">quick he has two brothers that were</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="4.199">involved with them he owned a car</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="5.46">dealership and was involved in money</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="5.19">laundering he also had access to like 70</text>
  <text start="436.599" dur="4.261">something other people in Congress all</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="4.351">their emails or passwords I mean this</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="4.049">guy had it all and he was making copies</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="4.26">of it a bunch of servers were found in</text>
  <text start="444.909" dur="4.171">his house when people moved out and I</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="4.229">think that he they got him on the money</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="4.11">money laundering charge but then they</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="4.891">turned him into this you know this</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="5.699">witness so the server itself though</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="5.43">contained the emails of the DNC</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="8.43">congressman so that&amp;#39;s all that all the</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="6.69">Democrat people in Congress it was used</text>
  <text start="467.319" dur="5.88">to communicate and send classified</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="8.97">information and US state secrets to</text>
  <text start="473.199" dur="8.25">Pakistan the server was stolen by a WAN</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="7.049">and still missing supposedly now</text>

  <text start="492.4" dur="4.829">Muslims went to Pakistan Pakistan is</text>
  <text start="495.069" dur="5.581">where we supposedly found Osama bin</text>

  <text start="500.65" dur="6.299">has nukes and we send them a lot of aid</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="7.259">from what I remember okay so that was</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="8.491">the second server on the list that was</text>
  <text start="510.069" dur="7.111">the house Democratic caucus server so</text>
  <text start="515.44" dur="4.219">that was the server used to host the</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="5.279">emails and probably other stuff for</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="4.211">Democratic members of the house okay</text>
  <text start="522.459" dur="5.12">third on the list</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="3.709">Clinton private email server</text>
  <text start="527.84" dur="5.94">it was owned by Clinton it was located</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="5.85">inside her home it was used to divert</text>
  <text start="533.78" dur="5.22">traffic from her state&amp;#39;s email address</text>
  <text start="536.42" dur="5.7">to avoid Freedom of Information Act</text>
  <text start="539" dur="3.69">requests so discovered by the general</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="3.63">public</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="9.81">it contained emails with classified</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="8.55">information BlackBerry devices that had</text>
  <text start="552.5" dur="5.73">been used to access the server were</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="7.02">destroyed with hammers 33,000 emails</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="5.85">were deleted using bleach bit never to</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="5.49">be seen by authorities so when you hear</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="5.88">people talk about where&amp;#39;s the 33,000</text>
  <text start="566.81" dur="4.14">missing Hillary Clinton emails that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.96" dur="2.52">what they&amp;#39;re talking about they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="6.66">talking about the server that she hosted</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="8.49">in her basement the last point on this</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="5.85">is it says many foreign powers may have</text>
  <text start="580.97" dur="4.59">hacked it and why wouldn&amp;#39;t they she</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="3.3">didn&amp;#39;t have a private security team</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="2.61">watching over this stuff she probably</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="3.51">didn&amp;#39;t even care what does she care</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re in control of everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="3.81">selling it anyway you know who cares if</text>
  <text start="593" dur="4.41">you get something out of her emails</text>
  <text start="594.08" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s probably what she thought I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="597.41" dur="4.02">guessing that you know they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="3.84">relaxed with this stuff now also worth</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="4.26">mentioning it&amp;#39;s not on this list but I</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="8.91">think the Weiner Anthony Weiner emails</text>

  <text start="612.23" dur="4.02">JIRA port there&amp;#39;s two bombshells in</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="3.93">there a lot of people miss this I</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="4.14">mentioned it before but there is a line</text>
  <text start="618.53" dur="4.86">in there from an FBI report talking</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="5.43">about Hillary Clinton crimes against</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="7.65">children as part of the evidence on that</text>
  <text start="625.82" dur="9.42">laptop so who knows what was on that</text>
  <text start="631.04" dur="7.38">Hillary Clinton private email server now</text>
  <text start="635.24" dur="6.78">the fourth server on the list is the</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="6.48">Gmail server and North Korea now this</text>
