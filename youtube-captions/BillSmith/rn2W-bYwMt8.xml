  <text start="173.99" dur="6.07">please support STG report okay but what</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="4.65">he was talking about the Seth Ridge leak</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="4.17">as well now the John Podesta leak that</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="3.24">happened on a spear phishing campaign</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.94">because that was a gmail hack that</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="6.18">wasn&amp;#39;t Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign mail</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="6.85">why does POTUS so why does Trump</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="6.3">continually refer to the server so I</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="5.189">think that&amp;#39;s just to keep it fresh you</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.23">know in the public eye like like we just</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="4.681">saw this has been out for months</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="5.43">okay we&amp;#39;ve known about this for over a</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="4.74">year year and a half now almost two</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="7.44">years it&amp;#39;s been two years now hasn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="6.81">since the DNC leak occurred so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="2.88">new everybody knows about Hoover they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="2.57">known about him since March they know</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="5.039">about him and his conflict with</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="7.06">potential conflict with Rosenstein POTUS</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="6">does not speculate the Q post says okay</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="4.62">so I mean the rest of us can see it we</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="4.381">can all see it my question is is why is</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.68">it taking so long unless it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="5.79">be time to bust right at the time when</text>

  <text start="264.24" dur="4.58">to see results now you know it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="2.57">four months</text>

  <text start="290.04" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;ve exhausted these conversations man</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="5.88">you know we know what&amp;#39;s about to happen</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="5.85">it just needs to happen if if that queue</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="3.75">clock is there and I&amp;#39;m missing something</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="2.82">you know if somebody can look on the cue</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="3.54">clock and tell me when Rosenstein is</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="5.52">gonna get fired all right I&amp;#39;m listening</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="5.76">but Lisa made Crowley that that thing</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.71">came across her Twitter feed a few weeks</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.71">ago said Rosenstein was gonna get fired</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="7.29">right remember Sheila Jackson with the</text>
  <text start="315.48" dur="6.48">pedo ring and then Tucker said Podesta</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="4.68">was gonna get immunity and that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="6">happen so I don&amp;#39;t know if these little</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="6">drops these little markers on on media</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.56">are just to keep it keep us talking</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="4.68">about the same thing when nothing has</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="7.35">really occurred it&amp;#39;s kind of what the</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="7.14">rest of it talks about so says think</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="6.78">said it repeats important repeats</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="6.24">important repeats important okay so if I</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="6.63">had to guess I think that they need to</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.55">they this is the cue and on stuff we</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="3.63">have gotten things out of it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="3.87">driven our conversation but to be honest</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="4.05">if you knew about cue and on or you know</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="3.66">about cue and on right now you knew</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="2.37">about it a couple months ago</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re probably ahead of the curve and</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="5.31">looking for this stuff for yourself you</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="5.4">know I mean you find it I think what qa9</text>
  <text start="368.64" dur="3.39">really has to do is it has to soften up</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.8">the public for what&amp;#39;s about to happen</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="4.8">and holy crap man I mean remember how</text>
  <text start="375.42" dur="2.76">depressed you were whenever you started</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="4.32">to find out about this stuff you just</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="8.37">don&amp;#39;t want it to be real so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="6.75">dealing its 2018 friend you know the</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="4.23">Internet&amp;#39;s been around for a while</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="4.41">people know about most this stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="4.83">just a lot of people choose not to</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="5.25">believe it it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an actual</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.53">conscious choice I believe on their</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="3.75">behalf to not look into it to not</text>
  <text start="400.14" dur="4.23">believe it</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="4.829">and you know we haven&amp;#39;t been doing I</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="4.019">think we&amp;#39;ve been over shooting our mark</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="6.091">so some somewhat in the conspiracy stuff</text>
  <text start="408.389" dur="5.851">I think the crazy stuff is cool but not</text>
  <text start="412.23" dur="6.06">every picture means something you know a</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="5.46">lot of them do so a marked approach is</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="2.82">important I think they have to repeat</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="3.54">this over and over and over on Twitter</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="3.99">because that&amp;#39;s the best way to get the</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.11">public consciousness to start to soak it</text>
  <text start="425.1" dur="4.23">up and for these people that don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="427.35" dur="5.67">to believe it to at least be introduced</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="6.089">in to the material so that when proof</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="4.59">actual proof does show up in the real</text>
  <text start="435.419" dur="5.011">media it shows up in government in some</text>
