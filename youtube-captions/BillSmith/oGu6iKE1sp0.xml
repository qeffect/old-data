  <text start="106.11" dur="5.67">they will generally nothing ever</text>

  <text start="114.93" dur="4.68">basically people are being bussed in</text>
  <text start="117.29" dur="5.89">someone so couldn&amp;#39;t vote the voting</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="5.009">machines were rigged but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re saying okay well the Democratic</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="4.911">candidate did win in a very very close</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="5.25">very close race</text>
  <text start="129.53" dur="5.32">okay so this first link that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.82" dur="7.16">pointing to saying that this the DOJ</text>
  <text start="134.85" dur="6.99">just just pushed out a press release and</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="5.35">this is what it points to and it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="5.01">justice gov so it&amp;#39;s government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="4.73">official it looks like anyway and this</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="6.18">was on March 20th so this was yesterday</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="7.06">and it says that this guy okay he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s a Philadelphia area political</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.98">consultant like in the area where we</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="5.46">just had the election he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s in that</text>
  <text start="161.1" dur="5.64">area right he&amp;#39;s a political consultant</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="6">and he&amp;#39;s being charged with an</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="3.93">indictment and superseding indictment I</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t know what that means maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="6.09">like indictment and all kinds of other</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="5.99">stuff I bet that&amp;#39;s what that means but</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s being charged with an indictment or</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="5.26">indicted with obstructing the</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="6.72">investigation of the Federal Election</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="8.64">Commission so there&amp;#39;s been an</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="9.51">investigation into election fraud I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="9.06">guessing or campaign financing and he</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.24">has not been cooperating so he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="201.6" dur="3.9">named openly so some of the people out</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="3.72">there that have talked about that giant</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="6.239">list of like I don&amp;#39;t know a million</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="6.36">sealed indictments do you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="10.671">possible this is one of them you know</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="10.56">and it&amp;#39;s being unsealed maybe I think so</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="6.43">so I don&amp;#39;t go into like all the details</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="7.379">here but it talks about basically this</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="5.79">guy his name&amp;#39;s Kenneth smuggler that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="5.131">that&amp;#39;s the guy they charged that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="4.56">the indictment there&amp;#39;s a what is this</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="3.57">indictments with a Z there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="9.56">misspelling on the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="240.75" dur="12.06">website okay that makes me think anyway</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="9.91">so there was he was funneling money to</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="8.31">different campaigns and he announced the</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.86">interesting part about it though is it</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.29">pretty much just calls out him like just</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="3.3">the one political consultant that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="4.86">never heard of and I&amp;#39;ve never heard of</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="9.629">but is in the Philadelphia area after a</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="9.39">really tightly contested House election</text>
  <text start="276.449" dur="6.72">so it doesn&amp;#39;t name anybody else it says</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="5.33">he was working on engaged in a</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="4.56">falsification and obstruction scheme</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="5.649">involving a candidate for the Democratic</text>
  <text start="287.729" dur="7.141">party&amp;#39;s nomination for member of the US</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="5.671">House of Representatives in 2014 and it</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="3.299">talks about routing campaign</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="4.109">contributions and legal finance staff</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.171">told the campaign through another</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="4.231">political consultant through the</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="4.74">candidate but so it never really names</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="4.32">who he&amp;#39;s working with her on whose</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="3.6">behalf he&amp;#39;s working for it just</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="3.24">basically they&amp;#39;re just charged this guy</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="4.44">with obstruction like he&amp;#39;s not talking</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="4.86">and they wanted to talk so they unsealed</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="4.289">these this indictment it looks like and</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re publicly posting that hey we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.409" dur="4.98">were unsealing and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re in dining</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="4.88">this guy I guess is that someone that</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="5.161">means it&amp;#39;s how I read it</text>
  <text start="327.169" dur="4">okay and it&amp;#39;s a superseding indictment</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="3.989">and I&amp;#39;m not sure what that word means</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="4.351">again but it seems important and I bet</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="4.021">it means that it&amp;#39;s involved with a whole</text>
  <text start="335.52" dur="4.95">bunch of other stuff like thereand</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="7.139">ighting him one time for a bunch of</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="8.009">things that he won&amp;#39;t talk about okay so</text>
  <text start="344.699" dur="8.34">the plot thickens right so this is the</text>
  <text start="348.479" dur="7.44">guy so this is this is the dude and Bob</text>
  <text start="353.039" dur="4.921">Brady is the Congress guy that he was</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="5.25">protecting in that article it sounds</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="7.079">like he&amp;#39;s a swamp rat and he isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.169" dur="4.981">seeking re-election and well you know</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="5.331">we&amp;#39;re all guessing that&amp;#39;s just because</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="7.59">he&amp;#39;s corrupt so this is the guy right</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="4.87">one of these guys one of these guys is</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="5.359">the congressman one one of these guys</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="5.71">Bob Brady the guys Kenneth&amp;#39;s smuggler so</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="4.731">okay so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="5.64">two dudes and at the Congress</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="5.91">congressman has two indicted strategists</text>
  <text start="386.59" dur="5.88">and they came out swinging after the</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="8.94">hearing so this was about six months ago</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="9.12">five months ago and it says that US</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="6.84">Representative Robert Brady he&amp;#39;s got two</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="6.51">indicted political strategists and they</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="5.76">got caught so bad that they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="4.44">denying that they did it they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="2.42">saying that they didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="4.34">illegal</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="9.19">okay and what they did was is they</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="8.2">helped funnel money to the current</text>
  <text start="422.89" dur="6.69">representative Brady&amp;#39;s opponent in this</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="6.65">election and that guy&amp;#39;s name was Jimmy</text>

  <text start="431.73" dur="6.22">municipal court judge and they were</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="4.17">gonna funnel money to him and get him to</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="4.68">drop out of the race so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="6.08">gonna buy him off and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="2.81">that&amp;#39;s not even illegal</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="4.03">denying that they had committed crimes</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="3.66">and vowing to give prosecutors of</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="4.98">bruisin fright fine at trial I bet</text>

  <text start="465.43" dur="4.74">$90,000 payment from Brady&amp;#39;s campaign</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="6.15">five years ago to persuade a primary</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="6.24">challenger to drop out of the race now</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.7">I&amp;#39;ll bet okay</text>
  <text start="476.41" dur="4.16">I&amp;#39;ll bet that Senator or sorry</text>
  <text start="478.56" dur="7.36">representative Brady knew about the</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="9.49">$90,000 okay and I bet that&amp;#39;s why that</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="5.49">guy got indicted because I bet campaign</text>
  <text start="490.06" dur="5.01">finance is probably the easiest thing to</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="4.86">convict on I don&amp;#39;t know the other stuff</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="3.06">seems like it&amp;#39;s gonna happen but this</text>
