  <text start="18" dur="6.42">he sticks out like a sore Kenyon now</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="6.269">this is what presidential portraits look</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="5.099">like and find the one that doesn&amp;#39;t match</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="5.31">okay one of these doesn&amp;#39;t belong here</text>
  <text start="29.519" dur="3.661">and you&amp;#39;re right it&amp;#39;s that one right</text>
  <text start="32.759" dur="2.191">there</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="3.39">so that&amp;#39;s the portrait right there I</text>
  <text start="34.95" dur="3.24">think it looks weird there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="4.5">symbolism going on in it that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="38.19" dur="6.77">gonna talk about right now it was</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="6.6">mentioned in the q posts so talks about</text>
  <text start="44.96" dur="4.57">flowers and gardens and then learn the</text>
  <text start="47.67" dur="3.93">civil symbolism which we will check into</text>

  <text start="51.6" dur="6.119">is D flower represent gives us a link to</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="5.281">go look at and the next Q post he says</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="4.86">is it a coincidence the Matrix movie</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.35">grew people as a crop used for energy</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="2.55">and controlled their mind sounds</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="3.769">familiar</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="6.121">wonder where they derived that idea from</text>
  <text start="68.299" dur="7.381">so we&amp;#39;re gonna move along quickly here</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="9.96">this is the guy that actually painted it</text>
  <text start="75.68" dur="9.369">but he didn&amp;#39;t okay this guy is a racist</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="5.22">his name is kee hind wily and he says</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="3.991">art is all about power</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="5.13">his quote from the CNN article back in</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="5.34">2015 says what I choose to do is to take</text>
  <text start="91.56" dur="4.769">people who happen to look like me black</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="5.099">and brown people from all over the world</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="4.65">increasingly and to allow them to occupy</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="7.621">that field of power</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="12.111">I understand blackness from the inside</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="8.1">out now this guy&amp;#39;s a racist he just is</text>
  <text start="113.09" dur="5.11">okay and we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna take a</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="5.19">look at this in depth so you&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.769">already seen this if you haven&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="4.64">guy has painted a bunch of black women</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="6.391">holding the severed heads of white women</text>
  <text start="125.03" dur="6.16">there&amp;#39;s one right there okay there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="4.8">another one right there it&amp;#39;s a thing he</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="4.8">does it&amp;#39;s sick I don&amp;#39;t think this is art</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="6.17">and the other thing I noticed by looking</text>
  <text start="135.99" dur="8.58">at his original photos sorry</text>
  <text start="140.33" dur="6.37">was that it looked very Asian it looked</text>
  <text start="144.57" dur="5.43">really Asian and then I saw this article</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.76">on the pundit today a racist calm man</text>
  <text start="150" dur="5.88">Obama&amp;#39;s portrait artist who hires cheap</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="6.84">Chinese labor to paint his work says</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="5.61">kill whitey is a major theme we already</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="4.26">covered the black women murdering white</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="4.29">women decapitated heads that&amp;#39;s him right</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.2">there he&amp;#39;s a fraud okay he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="5.13">paint this stuff he&amp;#39;s literally like a</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.92">t-shirt artist who says this is what I</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="4.98">want you to paint and then people paint</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="6.24">it here&amp;#39;s his quote it&amp;#39;s sort of a play</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="6.29">on the kill whitey thing fine whatever</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="5.7">man you know that&amp;#39;s pretty damn racist</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.99">but a lot of people have said that this</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="6.18">guy&amp;#39;s not gonna got no talent and he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="6.15">con man and it&amp;#39;s true doesn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="3.84">paint his work he pays Chinese women to</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="2.76">paint it now when I looked at this</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="4.62">painting that&amp;#39;s the first thing that</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="5.67">caught my eye was that it looks it has</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="4.92">an oriental aspect to it it has an</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="5.16">oriental feel it looks like someone from</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="6">the Orient has painted this now the</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="4.56">thing that that this guy picked out real</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.77">quick that I didn&amp;#39;t see was the</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="6.18">patterning see these patterns these are</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="4.86">all exactly the same and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re making this stuff in mass and</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="4.26">the reason why they do this is because</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s too difficult and time-consuming to</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="5.7">come up with new organic artwork in</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.78">China these people are paid basically</text>
  <text start="229.77" dur="3.63">slave labor to sit in there and mass</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="5.36">produce stuff they do this with a lot of</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="5.7">stuff Salvador Dali paintings a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="3.49">hand-painted knockoffs of famous</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="2.46">paintings that people would want to hang</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="3">up but they you know they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.58">the real thing there&amp;#39;s a good place to</text>
  <text start="243.36" dur="9.63">get it so there&amp;#39;s some other interesting</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="9.719">stuff to see in this painting now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.99" dur="5.94">sitting in a flower garden okay and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s a slave garden that&amp;#39;s what Q is</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="2.73">pointing to it&amp;#39;s a slave garden and</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="4.831">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that again here in a</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="5.7">second there&amp;#39;s some writing here on this</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="2.969">part that I can&amp;#39;t make out there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="5.279">Twitter</text>
  <text start="268.289" dur="6.66">a tweet calling that out but the most</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="8.421">interesting thing about this painting is</text>
  <text start="274.949" dur="9.901">that right there that is a hidden thumb</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="5.68">now this is his left arm and the thumb</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="2.61">is on the outside of the hand not on the</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="4.44">inside</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.519">so what&amp;#39;s that symbolize well if you</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="4.28">care to see it a little bit more</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="2.481">detailed</text>
  <text start="304.719" dur="8.79">that&amp;#39;s two right hands that&amp;#39;s a right</text>
  <text start="307.839" dur="8.7">hand with a thumb on the left arm now if</text>
  <text start="313.509" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re like me you&amp;#39;ve never heard of any</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="4.92">buddy</text>
  <text start="317.379" dur="7.981">having two right hands why would an</text>
  <text start="321.459" dur="6.18">artist paint an X sitting president with</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="4.709">two right hands it&amp;#39;s right there it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="5.73">easy to see there is a thumb okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="8.31">a right hand on the left arm so what is</text>
  <text start="333.369" dur="8.16">the symbolism of that the Wahhabi god</text>
  <text start="338.379" dur="7.59">who has two right hands Allah the man</text>
  <text start="341.529" dur="6.54">God part for Allah&amp;#39;s two right hands it</text>
  <text start="345.969" dur="5.4">comes from the hadith it doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="348.069" dur="6.57">from the Quran now the hadith and the</text>
  <text start="351.369" dur="4.8">Quran are two different books the</text>
  <text start="354.639" dur="3.36">crayons like the holy book similar to</text>
  <text start="356.169" dur="5.25">the Old Testament the Torah for the Jews</text>
  <text start="357.999" dur="8.27">whereas the hadith is a bunch of Islamic</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="7.62">laws this is the difference right here</text>
  <text start="366.269" dur="7.6">the hadith is the most important source</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="7.65">of religious laws of Islam now if that</text>
  <text start="373.869" dur="5.31">strikes a familiar chord and those who</text>
  <text start="376.689" dur="4.14">know their religious backgrounds okay</text>
  <text start="379.179" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s very similar to the difference</text>
  <text start="380.829" dur="5.79">between the Babylonian Talmud and the</text>
  <text start="383.709" dur="4.23">Torah and Judaism now nobody knows about</text>
  <text start="386.619" dur="4.23">this stuff I don&amp;#39;t know why people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.939" dur="4.861">know about this stuff but they know okay</text>
  <text start="390.849" dur="4.77">everybody Jewish understands this</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="5.819">because Jews do not study the Torah they</text>
  <text start="395.619" dur="5.67">study the Talmud and the Talmud is not</text>
  <text start="398.619" dur="6.03">the Word of God it&amp;#39;s the word of a</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="4.74">Jewish rabbi and it&amp;#39;s a gigantic volume</text>
  <text start="404.649" dur="4.08">set which could cover an entire</text>
  <text start="406.029" dur="5.88">bookshelf I can hold the Torah in my</text>
  <text start="408.729" dur="7.86">hand I can&amp;#39;t hold the Talmud and this is</text>
  <text start="411.909" dur="6.98">what they study so in that way Judaism</text>
  <text start="416.589" dur="4.68">is kind of overlapping with the Muslim</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="3.94">background Islam in that same way</text>
  <text start="421.269" dur="3.23">there&amp;#39;s a holy book and there&amp;#39;s the book</text>
  <text start="422.829" dur="5.61">of laws and that&amp;#39;s where this comes from</text>
  <text start="424.499" dur="5.861">now in the hadith there&amp;#39;s this passage</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="5.13">talking about both his hands are</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="4.739">right-handed and I don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="433.569" dur="4.26">into the weirdness of this but it kind</text>
  <text start="435.099" dur="3.601">of contradicts some other passages where</text>
  <text start="437.829" dur="2.701">talks about him using</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="3.62">left hand the only really he could do</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="4.35">that he&amp;#39;s a god whatever I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="442.32" dur="5.68">but this is the symbolism of why that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="6.6">important both his hands are</text>
  <text start="448" dur="6.02">right-handed you got it so why is this</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="2.54">important</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="7.27">that&amp;#39;s because also in there is slaves</text>
  <text start="458.92" dur="5.4">your right hands possess and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="4.5">going to go back into this in detail but</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="4.2">everybody who&amp;#39;s looked into the crane a</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="4.62">little bit has probably come across this</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="9">at one time or another has to do with</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="8.61">slavery and the possessing of slaves now</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="5.82">this is the link that Q has pointed to</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="5.7">and it talks about slave gardens okay</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="3.63">and and I&amp;#39;m gonna read this down here</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="3.15">because this is very interesting and it</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="4.02">will it will it will screw with your</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="4.71">mind on how you think slavery happened</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="4.5">in the United States so Henry Clay</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="3.87">Burroughs wrote this book and he</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="4.56">explained how slave gardens worked on</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="5.97">his masters Virginia plantation this is</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="5.61">his quote all right each man was allowed</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="4.95">one acre of ground to raise his own</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="6.3">little crop which if well cultivated</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="6.06">would produce 900 pounds of tobacco we</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="5.03">used his horse and plow the slave owners</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="5.87">they used the slave owners</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="6.79">infrastructure and worked the slaves</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="5.41">crops as well as we did the slave owners</text>
  <text start="523.78" dur="4.74">crops in the daytime and when ready for</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="7.29">market the slave owners sold our crop</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="7.38">with his giving each his share this was</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="7.32">our money to be spent for whatever we</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="6.66">wanted aside from that given by him now</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about the the way the</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="4.32">actual slavery worked in the United</text>
  <text start="544.93" dur="4.62">States there was laws protecting slaves</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="4.89">you could not mistreat slaves and the</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="4.59">people who did mistreat slaves were were</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="3.9">ostracized and they they faced backlash</text>
  <text start="554.14" dur="7.32">from the rest of the communities around</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="7.59">them people didn&amp;#39;t like this stuff now</text>
  <text start="561.46" dur="4.62">this is totally off topic but it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="5.58">mentioning that this is where most of</text>
  <text start="566.08" dur="4.29">our understanding of actual slavery in</text>
  <text start="568.84" dur="3.39">the United States comes from it&amp;#39;s a TV</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="5.01">show called roots</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="5.07">DUS back in 1976 it came at a very</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="4.08">interesting time this is about 12 years</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="4.05">after the civil rights movement and this</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="4.26">is what everybody bases their total</text>
  <text start="581.35" dur="3.75">misunderstanding of American slavery on</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="2.34">I&amp;#39;m not going to go into detail about</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="4.68">this I just thought it was worth</text>
  <text start="586.06" dur="6.41">mentioning and that same article that Q</text>
  <text start="589.78" dur="5.84">pointed to though it does mention that</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="5.74">these slave gardens in the United States</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="4.12">weren&amp;#39;t very extensive I mean they got a</text>
  <text start="598.21" dur="3.6">full acre and they made looks like a</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="3.84">pretty good amount of cash from each</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="4.65">crop that they were able to share and</text>
  <text start="603.58" dur="4.26">get back for themselves but these</text>
  <text start="606.46" dur="4.29">weren&amp;#39;t as extensive as they were in</text>
  <text start="607.84" dur="6.93">other places because slaveholders in the</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="5.76">United States mostly provided basic but</text>
  <text start="614.77" dur="4.08">meager provisions enough to maintain</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="4.35">themselves in these other places it was</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="3.39">really really important for them to have</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="3.21">these slave gardens because that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="2.91">they got like just some nutrients that</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="4.65">they would need just to have a normal</text>
  <text start="625.15" dur="5.91">lifestyle now again back to the portrait</text>
  <text start="628.72" dur="5.31">okay he&amp;#39;s not sitting in a slave garden</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="4.92">of tobacco right and I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="5.49">discount the whole purpose of it I mean</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="5.79">he is in a flower garden it could just</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="6.51">be an artistic expression it could just</text>
  <text start="641.77" dur="6.84">be a nicer way to present the background</text>
  <text start="646.03" dur="5.16">I mean it kind of looks nice once you</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="6.03">get past the symbolism but Q calls out</text>
