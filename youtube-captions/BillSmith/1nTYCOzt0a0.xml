  <text start="79.68" dur="5.52">actual views now I posted it about a</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="4.71">week ago I got that big boost from the</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.72">community but then I think it started to</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="5.22">get shared out and a lot of normies</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.559">started to find it and you know it went</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="4.86">through the roof again</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="5.611">so 96 thousand views in the last 48</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="4.14">hours and that&amp;#39;s like a week you know</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="5.069">five days after it passed through this</text>

  <text start="295.91" dur="5.65">right so Timothy&amp;#39;s after Mike Pence and</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s after this Roy Potter guy and most</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="4.56">of you out there okay you don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="4.35">really Potter anymore i I kind of this</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="2.97">was before I got on YouTube so I had</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="3.57">seen a couple of this guy&amp;#39;s videos but</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="4.829">it just seems it seems like low</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="5.669">production value with a face in front of</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="5.191">the camera that&amp;#39;s like the recipe to</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="5.101">gain trust here for some reason I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="5.809">I don&amp;#39;t really get that but again I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="5.82">calling Timothy home Seth based legit I</text>
  <text start="324.919" dur="4.99">believe this man and I&amp;#39;m gonna support</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="7.77">him going forward until I have evidence</text>
  <text start="329.909" dur="7.591">to the contrary so there now I also like</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="5.149">this guy&amp;#39;s channel okay you near Ock I</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="5.58">think he does a good job and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="4.981">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with listen people</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with monetization</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="4.269">nothing there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with it</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="2.79">okay if you want to donate to somebody</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="3.93">that you believe in and you want to</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.65">support go ahead there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="353.909" dur="4.471">with monetization there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.41">wrong with ad revenue okay these people</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="4.17">need to support themselves one way or</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="5.699">another somehow my problem with</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="5.01">monetization is this YouTube should not</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="3.961">be picking the winners and losers in</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="4.65">these conversations and essentially if</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="5.07">they allow one person to monetize their</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="4.98">channel talking about one side of a</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="5.069">subject and then don&amp;#39;t let another</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="4.259">person monetize their channel talking</text>
  <text start="380.009" dur="3.931">about the other side of that same</text>
  <text start="381.449" dur="4.291">subject then I got a problem with that</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="6.3">and that is suspicious to me it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="6.419">proof I know it&amp;#39;s not proof okay there</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="3.959">has to be money involved somewhere now</text>
  <text start="392.159" dur="3.87">the ad revenue model seems to be the</text>
  <text start="394.199" dur="5.101">best way to support people going forward</text>
  <text start="396.029" dur="5.131">and only after YouTube started smashing</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="4.62">this stuff down started smash</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="6.33">people on their ad revenue now we have</text>
  <text start="403.92" dur="5.01">GoFundMe campaigns and patreon and then</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="4.68">you get into patreon and they&amp;#39;re kicking</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="4.65">people off a patreon so it&amp;#39;s like until</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="3.18">we get this internet bill of rights and</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="3.24">full protection for freedom of speech as</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="5.04">long as you&amp;#39;re not breaking the u.s.</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="5.91">code of law okay it&amp;#39;s not gonna stop now</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="6.48">I think that we need to press the reset</text>
  <text start="422.73" dur="9.26">button I think every person should be</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="7.41">able to monetize excuse me</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="5.32">every person should be able to run ads</text>
  <text start="434.28" dur="5.22">on their platform they should be able to</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="5.88">run as many ads as they want to I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s totally free I think but we</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="5.4">shouldn&amp;#39;t be picking YouTube especially</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="5.61">the social media platforms should not be</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="4.59">picking the winners and losers okay so I</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="4.38">like uni rock I think he&amp;#39;s got a very</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="4.23">interesting show he&amp;#39;s skeptical on this</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.56">stuff and I think that we need that kind</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="5.16">of voice in our community so you know</text>
  <text start="460.17" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m back in this guy I think that he</text>
  <text start="462.57" dur="3.33">does a good job and I think you know I</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="5.1">think if you go look through my</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="5.4">subscribers list I&amp;#39;m backing everybody</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.41">on my own subscribe so you can go to my</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="3.69">channel look who I subscribe to if you</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="3.39">see something in the future that I</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="4.56">missed please please send me messages so</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="4.8">I know but I think you near Ock is legit</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="4.56">and I think that I think he&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="6.03">skeptical voice he he asked good</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="5.52">questions and I like I like a show man I</text>
  <text start="488.04" dur="3.21">like his production value he&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.22">cool he&amp;#39;s got a cool thing going on</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="5.04">there it&amp;#39;s entertaining</text>
  <text start="493.85" dur="5.47">now David Seaman</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="5.73">okay he&amp;#39;s skeptical about Q and on I</text>
  <text start="499.32" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t have a problem with that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="3.3">saying that Q Donna was legit in the</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="4.2">beginning and then he was taken over</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="4.83">after he left for Chan and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="3.72">man I mean it looked like they were we</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="4.11">were following the same line of thinking</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.65">I at this point I think</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="3.81">q and on is fairly legit and I think the</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="5.91">Chan community clears that crap out</text>
  <text start="518.07" dur="5.13">early so I really think that the Chan</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="3.9">community there ain&amp;#39;t no getting around</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="7.74">it man the autists will will smash you</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="6.69">if you say something stupid maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="3.54">not always good maybe that&amp;#39;s not always</text>
  <text start="532.71" dur="3.09">bad but I really think the</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="3.75">enough people over there looking to</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="5.55">verify this stuff you know and they keep</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="7.53">people honest there&amp;#39;s a reverse trolling</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="6.87">on that channel so at this point I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="4.17">know but what I find weird is that</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="4.109">David David Seaman was the guy that</text>
  <text start="549.93" dur="4.83">broke pizza gate right he was he was</text>
  <text start="552.329" dur="4.801">basically the face of pizza gate and I</text>
  <text start="554.76" dur="3.54">used to watch him and I still you know I</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="3.05">don&amp;#39;t know if I support him anymore or</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="4.56">not I don&amp;#39;t I think maybe he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.93">maybe I don&amp;#39;t know maybe there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="5.039">jealousy there I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="565.11" dur="4.5">his deal is but he put out this video</text>
  <text start="567.899" dur="4.471">just a little bit ago says YouTube</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="4.62">removes all my channels ad money after</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.459">mentioning David hog at the Florida</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="6.24">suiting now my question is is I watched</text>
  <text start="577.829" dur="5.401">this guy scream John Podesta&amp;#39;s name into</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="7.53">the camera scream it for months just</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="8.01">over and over and so how is he how is</text>
  <text start="588" dur="6.149">YouTube still allowing him to monetize</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="5.13">his channel it&amp;#39;s just a question I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="3.93">accusing David of anything maybe he can</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="4.29">respond to this on his own terms</text>
  <text start="598.079" dur="5.581">I&amp;#39;m not shining the spotlight it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="5.19">an honest question alright it looks to</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="3.6">me like YouTube is picking winners and</text>
  <text start="605.85" dur="2.25">losers in these conversations and it</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="2.46">aggravates me</text>
  <text start="608.1" dur="4.77">so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my only problem with</text>
  <text start="609.72" dur="6.84">monetization now back to the I think I</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="5.31">saw on uni rocks channel you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="2.88">got a way that you can go shop on Amazon</text>
  <text start="618.18" dur="3.089">and he gets a little bit of kickback on</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="3.57">that you can send him a little bit of</text>
  <text start="621.269" dur="3.93">money if you want to do that I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="3.96">got a good show he had to pay for his</text>
  <text start="625.199" dur="3.991">microphone and his setup and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="3.75">entertaining to watch so I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="629.19" dur="3.24">see a problem with what he&amp;#39;s doing I</text>
  <text start="630.72" dur="5.79">think he actually came up with a pretty</text>
  <text start="632.43" dur="7.05">brilliant way to to you know keep</text>
  <text start="636.51" dur="5.46">himself running without really you know</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="2.669">sacrificing his viewpoints so I respect</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="4.38">that</text>
  <text start="642.149" dur="6.69">I think anti school is selling t-shirts</text>
  <text start="646.35" dur="6.21">I know Mark dye sells t-shirts and books</text>
  <text start="648.839" dur="5.19">so you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="652.56" dur="2.759">ways to do this I really think that we</text>
  <text start="654.029" dur="3.151">need to press the reset button though</text>
  <text start="655.319" dur="5.191">and I think everybody should be allowed</text>
  <text start="657.18" dur="7.29">to monetize their channels with these</text>
  <text start="660.51" dur="6.3">ads or no one should to everybody or</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="3.9">nobody and if advertisers don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="666.81" dur="3.84">content then they can say hey I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="668.37" dur="3.659">the content but as you can see I mean if</text>
  <text start="670.65" dur="3.78">you looked at my traffic report earlier</text>
  <text start="672.029" dur="5.371">if I was an advertiser and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="5.43">sell you caveman you know or I wanted to</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="4.11">sell you some prep supplies this is</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="4.83">exactly the audience that I would be</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="5.67">trying to advertise to so I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="3.54">why advertisements advertisers would</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="2.99">have a problem with this in the</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="6.09">beginning then you look at YouTube</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="6.609">they&amp;#39;re advertising managers talking</text>
  <text start="694.32" dur="5.37">about how to demonetised Breitbart news</text>
  <text start="696.779" dur="4.801">is this is just a common tactic and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.69" dur="3.06">all about these companies picking</text>
  <text start="701.58" dur="5.19">winners and losers and that&amp;#39;s where I</text>
  <text start="702.75" dur="6.45">have a problem okay so the mike pence</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="3.75">thing I&amp;#39;ve commented on my own videos</text>
  <text start="709.2" dur="3.27">just so you can see what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="4.92">about but when I posted this video</text>

  <text start="715.44" dur="3.78">number two hit under mike pence the</text>
  <text start="717.72" dur="3.39">viewership was going through the roof</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="4.86">comments were going through the roof</text>
  <text start="721.11" dur="5.91">maybe P means Pope maybe P means pence</text>
  <text start="724.08" dur="5.07">maybe P means both you ever thought of</text>
  <text start="727.02" dur="3.96">that maybe it does I don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="729.15" dur="3.45">have any confirmation the Chan community</text>

  <text start="732.6" dur="5.25">pence over there I don&amp;#39;t you know I</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.619">don&amp;#39;t know but it&amp;#39;s number two right</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="4.65">after posting it and it gets a huge</text>

  <text start="773.16" dur="4.92">changed every single video is different</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="4.29">now it&amp;#39;s all out of order it looks like</text>
  <text start="778.08" dur="4.05">it was stacked ranked okay this this</text>
  <text start="780.33" dur="4.8">video that I did is smashed at the</text>
  <text start="782.13" dur="5.19">bottom it was in like the hundred and</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="3.81">fifty s I think Timothy Holmes South&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="821.579" dur="4.38">really know what to think about this now</text>
  <text start="823.649" dur="3.781">you go to contrast this I would think</text>

  <text start="827.43" dur="4.29">Bader Ginsburg stuff right I mean the</text>

  <text start="833.759" dur="5.971">and you know this is gonna be the</text>
  <text start="838.23" dur="4.109">biggest this is gonna be the biggest</text>
  <text start="839.73" dur="4.89">video on YouTube probably ever for Ruth</text>
  <text start="842.339" dur="5.161">Bader Ginsburg including CNN and all the</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="4.259">MSNBC talking points so I really</text>
  <text start="847.5" dur="3.06">encourage the rest of you to start</text>
  <text start="848.879" dur="4.791">making some Ruth Bader Ginsburg videos</text>
  <text start="850.56" dur="5.43">okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get rid of this person</text>

  <text start="855.99" dur="2.969">mainstream spotlight so normal people</text>
  <text start="857.879" dur="2.88">can see what she&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="858.959" dur="3.63">and I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;ll last last much</text>
  <text start="860.759" dur="3.361">longer than that and she&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="862.589" dur="5.67">have any public support when they go to</text>
