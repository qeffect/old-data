  <text start="11.429" dur="3.54">to change up what I&amp;#39;m doing I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="13.5" dur="2.94">that we all need to make slight</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="3.931">adjustments so we need to stay the</text>

  <text start="371.289" dur="4.111">not slip through because I think that</text>

  <text start="385.93" dur="3.299">think what we should do is we should</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.479">lean on the mainstream reports and say</text>
  <text start="389.229" dur="3.391">look here&amp;#39;s what they reported and then</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="4.771">here&amp;#39;s what I found you know so just</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="3.81">counteract everything they do and I</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="2.849">think that&amp;#39;s what we should be going</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="3.689">forward also</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="4.77">I want to make this clear the Issac</text>

  <text start="425.619" dur="7.95">pornography characters child porn</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="7.02">characters and storylines so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.569" dur="4.111">that so I should probably write Cartoon</text>
  <text start="435.459" dur="6">Network actually let me just write Rick</text>
  <text start="437.68" dur="6.87">and Morty because that&amp;#39;s all on the same</text>

  <text start="454.689" dur="6.361">Ashcraft they will not discuss her okay</text>
  <text start="457.959" dur="5.52">let me make that real apparent and Sarah</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="6.119">Ruth Ashcraft is the one who broke the</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="5.84">internet not Isaac Cappy so I made some</text>
  <text start="467.169" dur="5.941">Isaac Cappy videos I&amp;#39;ll make a few more</text>
  <text start="469.319" dur="5.35">but drop Sarah Ruth Ashcraft in a couple</text>

  <text start="502.569" dur="3.09">they want to bury this quick that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="504.099" dur="4.141">I think that we should push these two</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="6.81">things as much as possible and we should</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="6">link Isaac capi into Sarah Ruth Ashcraft</text>
