  <text start="0.03" dur="6.12">hey what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s bill Smith as</text>
  <text start="3.54" dur="4.049">you can see I&amp;#39;m back up on Twitter so if</text>
  <text start="6.15" dur="3.51">people want to talk to me you can talk</text>
  <text start="7.589" dur="3.241">to me on Twitter I&amp;#39;m on gab too but I</text>
  <text start="9.66" dur="6.53">don&amp;#39;t use it a lot</text>
  <text start="10.83" dur="7.74">I think gab just not really like a</text>
  <text start="16.19" dur="4.03">popularized platform and I think we need</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="3.209">to have a more popularized message so I</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="2.969">stick to Twitter however I can I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="4.521">banned twice off Twitter but they gave</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="5.221">me back they gave me back my account and</text>
  <text start="26.3" dur="6.189">when I was getting banned I started</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="6.72">seeing this screen I don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="5.551">is just a mix-up and my my account will</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="6.26">come back online but I can tell you that</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="9.449">five minutes ago I posted three words I</text>
  <text start="41.39" dur="7.78">posted single state solution I honestly</text>
  <text start="47.489" dur="4.201">believe after everything that I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="6.36">written from what I understand about</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="5.4">global politics stuff in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="5.07">I think I think the single state</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="5.82">solution which means that you combine</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="4.559">Israel and Palestine into the same</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="3.72">country just makes the most amount of</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="4.401">sense okay the Jews aren&amp;#39;t going to go</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="6.09">anywhere it would be really difficult to</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="5.77">DC Israel at this point you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="6.75">been around for 70 years I think the</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="7.26">only option the only option is to give</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="6.27">Palestinians citizenship to Israel I</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="3.72">think that is the way that&amp;#39;s the way</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="3.949">forward</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how we make progress here</text>
  <text start="89.689" dur="5.771">we need a single state solution at this</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="6.54">point it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s popped up a couple</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="6.03">places I talked about Zionism a lot I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="4.5">not anti Jewish or anti-semitic okay my</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="4.5">best friend I&amp;#39;ve said this before my</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="5.159">best friend is Jewish he converted to</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.5">Christianity his family did when they</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.96">moved to the country because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="7.379">want him learning about the Talmud from</text>
  <text start="114.439" dur="5.351">temple on Saturdays they didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="3.39">didn&amp;#39;t think it was they didn&amp;#39;t think he</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="3.359">was right they liked the message of</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="5.551">Jesus Christ much more it&amp;#39;s a much more</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="7.021">inclusive message Zionism especially the</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="6.899">Talmud is a very very ugly thing for</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="5.519">anything that&amp;#39;s not establishment Jew so</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="4.56">if you&amp;#39;re not if you&amp;#39;re not Jewish and I</text>
  <text start="135.689" dur="3.451">don&amp;#39;t mean like Jewish like Jerome Corsi</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="3.81">is Jewish</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="5.76">I mean Jewish like genetically tested</text>
  <text start="142.079" dur="5.431">Jewish if you&amp;#39;re not genetically tested</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="4.44">Jewish which means it&amp;#39;s a race you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.51" dur="4.259">not part of the Jewish race I think</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="6.41">that&amp;#39;s Kazarian at this point Ashkenazi</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s not Hebrew okay</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="6.569">Hebrew is Jewish that&amp;#39;s what Jesus was</text>
  <text start="158.909" dur="6.181">Jesus was a Hebrew Ashkenazi Jews are</text>
  <text start="162.319" dur="4.241">some people say Kazarian you know</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re German Jews though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="2.73">Europeans that&amp;#39;s why they pass is white</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="6.209">that&amp;#39;s why they tell everybody that</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re white that&amp;#39;s why they get to run</text>
  <text start="174.389" dur="3.871">the world with a double standard you</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="3.089">know they get to be part of the white</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="3.539">race when it suits them and the moment</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="4.86">that they need to retreat back into</text>
  <text start="181.799" dur="9.36">minority status they become Jews so</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="7.89">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just it now the</text>
  <text start="191.159" dur="5.131">Palestinians from what I understand are</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="5.191">Hebrew some people can say no some</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.169">people can say yes I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="5.429">have the proof or anything but they live</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="5.49">in Palestine Bethlehem is in Palestine</text>
  <text start="203.579" dur="4.351">now it&amp;#39;s in quote/unquote Israel but the</text>
  <text start="205.949" dur="5.311">whole area used to be Palestine until we</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="5.479">yanked it away from the Palestinians now</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="5.61">the Palestinians are under intense</text>
  <text start="213.409" dur="4.991">military occupation by Israel they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="3.6">not allowed to have a good economy</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re basically a slave race at this</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="4.56">point I I think that that&amp;#39;s probably the</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.58">best way to put the Palestinian</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="7.049">situation I also believe that Hamas is</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="4.86">controlled by the Mossad that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="232.079" dur="3.571">thing that makes sense at this point</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s why they take you know peaceful</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="3.72">protesters and put them up front so the</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="4.05">so the Jews in Israel can shoot them</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.829">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening they do it all</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="5.609">the time you can go watch youtube videos</text>
  <text start="244.199" dur="5.12">about how Israelis really feel about the</text>
  <text start="247.199" dur="6.301">Palestinians there&amp;#39;s this intense hatred</text>
  <text start="249.319" dur="5.831">and I think a lot of people at this</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="3.69">point are starting to figure out Zionism</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="5.699">isn&amp;#39;t good for anybody it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s a racist ideology and the</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="4.38">Palestinians are locked into these cages</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="3.209">they don&amp;#39;t have a lot of room to move</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="2.131">their country has been stripped from</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="2.46">them</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="4.44">they were placed into basically a</text>
  <text start="269.189" dur="6">compound under military occupation by</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.41">Israel so if you think that&amp;#39;s okay then</text>
  <text start="275.189" dur="3.301">by all means</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="4.65">support Zionism okay you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.47">Jewish or you have you know Jewish</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="3.769">interest Jewish leanings like drum</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="3.69">course he does</text>
  <text start="284.629" dur="4.151">evangelical Christians like if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="5.579">supporting Zionism you need you need to</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="5.039">really you need to really like have a</text>
  <text start="292.229" dur="3.75">moral conversation with yourself because</text>
  <text start="293.819" dur="5.761">that&amp;#39;s not what Jesus would want Jesus</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="7.71">would not want that he rebelled against</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="5.79">this he rebelled against Zionism early</text>
  <text start="303.689" dur="4.051">I know Zionism is you know that was</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="7.319">coined in the 1800s but the idea of that</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="7.41">of this intense cultural unity racial</text>
  <text start="312.689" dur="5.22">unity across Jews at the expense of</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="3.84">everybody else is a double standard it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.909" dur="3.66">hurting the world</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.32">it can&amp;#39;t be sustained people are dying</text>
  <text start="321.569" dur="5.19">every day because of this and it needs</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="4.68">to end so this is what I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="326.759" dur="5.58">saying that we need to start talking</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="6.12">about a single state solution it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.339" dur="4.531">something that nobody in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="5.25">media has talked about for my entire</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="4.349">lifetime you&amp;#39;ll always hear two-state</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="3.51">solution two-state solution which means</text>
  <text start="341.219" dur="4.801">we need to find a way to get the</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="8.419">Palestinians to accept being locked in</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="5.269">their their cages you know the West Bank</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="6.31">sorry not the West Bank I guess the Gaza</text>
  <text start="353.94" dur="6.87">Strip there they&amp;#39;re locked in these like</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.799">military occupied areas and there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="3.27">what are they supposed to do man like</text>
  <text start="362.879" dur="3.801">what are they supposed to do</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="5.519">Israel&amp;#39;s got nukes Israel&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="5.229">high-class weaponry we&amp;#39;re sending them</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="5.551">fighter jets now to drop bombs on Syria</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="5.16">it just doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense so I</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="5.189">think that we need to start as as a</text>
  <text start="377.069" dur="4.741">movement okay as a movement in the queue</text>
  <text start="380.339" dur="3.57">and on community I don&amp;#39;t know if this is</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="5.219">what Trump&amp;#39;s plan is I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="383.909" dur="6.81">this is what the Qun on plan was I know</text>
  <text start="387.029" dur="6.51">that Israel seems to be last on that</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="4.801">list so if that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed I</text>
  <text start="393.539" dur="4.261">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t see Israel going away as a</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="5.85">country I&amp;#39;ll just be totally honest that</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="5.55">would be ideal but</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;re gonna get a little you gonna get</text>
  <text start="403.35" dur="3.75">I mean there would be so much pushback</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="2.61">from every angle I think that would be</text>
  <text start="407.1" dur="4.08">difficult so I think what needs to</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="5.79">happen is we need to argue for a single</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="5.01">state solution I think it&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="4.05">that would piss off Israeli Jews the</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="4.68">most I think it&amp;#39;s the thing that they</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="5.73">would want last because if Palestinians</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="5.01">have access to Jewish citizenship</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="8.76">it totally neutralizes a ton of this</text>
  <text start="425.88" dur="9.27">conversation so again we need to argue</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="4.77">or at least have a conversation about</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="4.65">what a single state solution would</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="4.91">entail how to accomplish it whether or</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="5.31">not it&amp;#39;s good or bad or a net positive</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="4.63">I&amp;#39;m gonna refresh my page one last time</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="6.36">to see if you know saying that on</text>
  <text start="447" dur="5.85">Twitter was a problem all right so I</text>
  <text start="451.47" dur="5.73">came back up so it could have just been</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="6.15">a technical difficulty here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="457.2" dur="3.81">saying okay that was my tweet this is</text>
  <text start="459" dur="3.45">this is what I that&amp;#39;s what I tweeted</text>
  <text start="461.01" dur="4.71">right before I started getting that blue</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="5.96">page so again could just be a little</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="4.56">mistake I&amp;#39;ve had little Twitter issues</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="3.88">several times in the last couple weeks</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="3.36">but this is what I&amp;#39;m saying okay and</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="4.89">this is what I&amp;#39;m gonna talk I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="5.22">start talking about this I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="5.21">this is the correct answer but I think</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="3.53">it&amp;#39;s a discussion that we need to have</text>
  <text start="482.45" dur="6.15">so until next time this is Bill Smith</text>
  <text start="485.18" dur="3.42">thanks for watching</text>
