  <text start="15.9" dur="4.83">down some stuff I think it gets kind of</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="4.259">confusing though because sometimes the</text>
  <text start="20.73" dur="4.41">same thing points in multiple different</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="4.291">directions and there&amp;#39;s valid stuff to</text>

  <text start="26.82" dur="4.379">direction so I&amp;#39;ve thought about this I</text>

  <text start="84.33" dur="7.14">very very I guess detailed there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="172.11" dur="6.15">it really kind of like ignites something</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="6.42">in you you know like it just does but I</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="4.05">think it&amp;#39;s something that people often</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="6.12">overlook is how important the legal</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="6.84">system is having like a large network of</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="5.16">lawyers people who know the law can</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="4.74">prosecute are good at it not just</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="4.74">investigative but like are good at</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="3.57">operating inside of the courts I mean</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s a lot I think it turned over</text>
  <text start="197.46" dur="9.14">just on like two words sometimes you</text>
  <text start="199.71" dur="9.54">know so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s easy to overlook that</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.32">so this kind of points out all the other</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="4.98">cue posts that were related to it I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="4.58">covered this before but you know news</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="5.01">unlocks the message find the Keystone</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="5.74">expand your thinking take multiple paths</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="6.21">one connects to another learn to read</text>
  <text start="222.24" dur="5.88">the map so these are these are honestly</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.259">things that like there&amp;#39;s no way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s like you can make that you can make</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="4.741">such a good case for so many different</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="4.95">angles on the same post sometimes and</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="3.81">then other times they come out and they</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.46">specify it later or you see the news and</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.19">then it it totally makes sense what they</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="6.27">said a few weeks before it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="5.759">Nostradamus stuff you know sometimes but</text>
  <text start="247.95" dur="3.33">then you get into the follow the</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="3.721">bloodlines what is the Keystone - Satan</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="4.53">exists you know you&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="6.54">Illuminati stuff there does the thought</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="6.27">of Satan exist who worships Satan what</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="4.47">is a cult epstein Island we know most of</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="4.35">that stuff you know when does a map</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="3.06">become a guide what is a keystone</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="3.21">everything</text>
  <text start="267" dur="5.99">stated is relevant everything future</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="3.35">provides past</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="6.55">POTUS opened the door of all doors so</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="4.83">was this the door of all doors you know</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="6.24">whatever this was the thing I find odd</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="5.7">is that it was established in 1978 I</text>
  <text start="286.23" dur="4.74">would think that&amp;#39;s well after a</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="7.88">corruption pretty much you know put the</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="6.72">stranglehold on but maybe not you know</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="6.49">expand your thinking what is the</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="7.08">Keystone wealth over generations buys</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.71">power power over generations buys more</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.56">wealth and control more wealth and</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="6.99">control buys countries and it&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="7.95">and families combined that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="5.16">triangle could also mean that trilateral</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="3.21">commission maybe that&amp;#39;s probably the</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="3.33">triangle that we&amp;#39;ve discussed before</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="4.38">that that equals the new world order in</text>
  <text start="322.32" dur="5.73">the inner part of the triangle of the</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="5.76">families is gonna collapse so what is</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="5.16">the Keystone and what nation dominates</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="6.71">all others what nation has influence</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="7.26">over most others what is the keystone</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="4.9">now that that right there that what</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="3.5">nation dominates all others at this</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="5.55">point I think there&amp;#39;s maybe three</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="10.21">possibilities maybe the United States</text>
  <text start="347.79" dur="9.57">definitely Russia and China no I mean</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="10.549">China maybe but I&amp;#39;d say the other two</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="9.84">are probably Israel or the UK the crown</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="5.351">but I&amp;#39;d say out of the three Adaline</text>
  <text start="367.2" dur="5.969">finally in Israel probably that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m saying that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s for that</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="3.661">reason when you don&amp;#39;t really know what</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="3.42">the problem is you know you realize</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="3.06">there is a problem but there&amp;#39;s just no</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="4.559">way that you understand the full scope</text>
  <text start="379.89" dur="4.529">of it you know trying to take it in</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="5.281">pieces and try to understand the big</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="9.241">picture here but this is why you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.2" dur="6.899">be like I would say pro-israel I would</text>
  <text start="393.66" dur="2.85">say Israel first you definitely can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="395.099" dur="4.831">Israel first but I would say that you</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="4.29">you can&amp;#39;t even be pro-israel I mean you</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="3.019">if you&amp;#39;re pro</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="6.63">Israel you&amp;#39;re gonna have to give that up</text>
  <text start="402.949" dur="11.801">because if you&amp;#39;re pro United States</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="8.669">Magga and that&amp;#39;s who you are then what</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="5.4">would you ever do if you have to split</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="5.421">your you know your loyalty you know if</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.919">you got to do something</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="5.5">that&amp;#39;s good for Israel but just happens</text>
  <text start="425.069" dur="5.791">to be bad for the United States and its</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="5.519">people like what happens then like which</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="4.799">would you choose if you would choose the</text>
  <text start="432.539" dur="5.88">Israel policy that I&amp;#39;d say that you know</text>
  <text start="435.659" dur="5.551">you&amp;#39;re not Magga you&amp;#39;re you shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="5.43">watching these and that&amp;#39;s just foolish</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="4.41">so I have I don&amp;#39;t have a giant problem</text>
  <text start="443.849" dur="3.961">with it but this is this is kind of the</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="5.16">issue I have with a couple couple people</text>
