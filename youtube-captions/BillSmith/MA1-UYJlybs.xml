  <text start="10.26" dur="6.9">cue post 1500 and it is a picture of a</text>
  <text start="15.96" dur="3.95">Google badge</text>
  <text start="17.16" dur="8.22">I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s like an ID badge and</text>
  <text start="19.91" dur="7.9">it says guess so that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="11.04">this whole thing it&amp;#39;s really nothing to</text>
  <text start="27.81" dur="9.99">look at a printed badge cryptic stuff so</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="3.959">I guess that just means that they have</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="10.439">an insider or that they&amp;#39;re coming to get</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="12.441">them next or maybe it&amp;#39;s both all right</text>

  <text start="59.55" dur="8.7">case you wanted to take take a look at</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="11.161">it you can pause it okay so this is</text>
  <text start="68.25" dur="8.07">happening and what this means is that</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="8.099">the EU is losing and I heard a rumor</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="5.46">I haven&amp;#39;t confirmed it it&amp;#39;s just a rumor</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="3.961">it&amp;#39;s something I saw in passing</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="6.3">somewhere that said that Steve Bannon</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="7.02">was over in Europe helping these</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="5.55">countries somehow and I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="3.99">he would be doing okay I like Steve</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="4.46">Bannon I think that him leave in the</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="5.19">White House he was one of the good guys</text>
  <text start="98.09" dur="4.33">but I could be wrong man I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="4.799">you know it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;d that was my</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="4.589">that&amp;#39;s my opinion is that Steve Bannon</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="3.241">is one of the good guys and he has said</text>
  <text start="107.009" dur="3.091">some pros I and his stuff in the past</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="2.97">but I think it&amp;#39;s kind of because he knew</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="2.82">he had to play the game you know what</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s like you know quick you get smashed</text>

  <text start="124.74" dur="3.629">played the game</text>

  <text start="131.85" dur="3.5">the White House and now this is</text>

  <text start="615.69" dur="4.95">possible way to use what I have you know</text>
  <text start="618.96" dur="2.85">and you could make the case oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="3.15">because there&amp;#39;s rules but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="621.81" dur="2.94">so they already had net neutrality so</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="2.79">it&amp;#39;s already people already using</text>
  <text start="624.75" dur="3.81">whatever they want it&amp;#39;s just like a drop</text>
  <text start="626.58" dur="4.59">in the bucket I can&amp;#39;t use it all you get</text>
  <text start="628.56" dur="5.94">that and half of us have unlimited stuff</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="6.05">now and some of its mobile so who cares</text>
  <text start="634.5" dur="5.25">I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="6.58">but this is this is going on there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="639.75" dur="6.42">big merger right but they say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="4.65">gonna allow telecom companies like AT&amp;amp;T</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="4.32">to prioritize their own content in the</text>
  <text start="648.45" dur="4.44">past 18 t didn&amp;#39;t have that much content</text>
  <text start="650.49" dur="4.29">but with the addition of Time Warner now</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="4.29">gives them a library encompassing Warner</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="4.59">Brothers 2 TBS so they they basically</text>
  <text start="657.18" dur="3.75">just bought cable you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="4.079">cable stuff</text>
  <text start="660.93" dur="6.24">and nobody watches it you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="663.449" dur="5.67">dying it&amp;#39;s a dying thing already that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.17" dur="5.01">why they had to merge you know because</text>
  <text start="669.119" dur="4.38">the service providers or the tech</text>
  <text start="672.18" dur="4.439">companies those are the ones that are</text>
  <text start="673.499" dur="4.77">gonna rule this all out that&amp;#39;s it so it</text>
  <text start="676.619" dur="3.541">says the combination these two stories</text>
  <text start="678.269" dur="6.391">is spooking every video on-demand</text>
  <text start="680.16" dur="6.51">service from YouTube to Netflix so</text>
  <text start="684.66" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s gonna be left you know</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="4.889">no one watches cable TV anymore that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="688.92" dur="4.649">it&amp;#39;s dying out you know live sports was</text>
  <text start="691.559" dur="7.38">all that was gonna save it and all live</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="7.08">sports now is on is in decline the weird</text>
  <text start="698.939" dur="4.14">thing is is the thing that is taking up</text>
  <text start="700.649" dur="3.831">a lot of the space now one place is like</text>
  <text start="703.079" dur="3.87">YouTube is news</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="6.07">so channels just like this videos like</text>
  <text start="706.949" dur="6.961">this one taking up more of a percentage</text>
  <text start="710.55" dur="5.029">of the YouTube viewership I read that</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="3.869">somewhere</text>
  <text start="715.579" dur="5.56">okay this showed up in a previous video</text>
  <text start="717.779" dur="7.891">that I did I think this might be it just</text>
  <text start="721.139" dur="7.2">wanted no that&amp;#39;s not it okay so this is</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="7.49">this place called Casa Padre it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="728.339" dur="9.48">converted what is it it&amp;#39;s a converted</text>
  <text start="733.16" dur="6.609">Walmart down by the border now I had</text>
  <text start="737.819" dur="4.26">just kind of slipped something in there</text>
  <text start="739.769" dur="4.86">at the end of a video two days ago I</text>
  <text start="742.079" dur="4.38">think they it was two or three days ago</text>
  <text start="744.629" dur="3.63">for two seconds in the very end of the</text>
  <text start="746.459" dur="3.81">video you can see a story that I just</text>
  <text start="748.259" dur="3.33">kind of flashed up because I kind of I</text>
  <text start="750.269" dur="3.81">kind of think that this is we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="751.589" dur="4.92">hear more about this okay I think that</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="5.1">this this is the strategy I saw</text>
  <text start="756.509" dur="5.101">something on Twitter from Trump well you</text>
  <text start="759.179" dur="3.63">see if I go find it real quick okay</text>
  <text start="761.61" dur="2.669">actually this is where we&amp;#39;re gonna in</text>
  <text start="762.809" dur="4.89">the video I hadn&amp;#39;t been over here in</text>
  <text start="764.279" dur="5.52">like a day or two and there&amp;#39;s just been</text>
  <text start="767.699" dur="3.961">a huge amount of tweets right talking</text>
  <text start="769.799" dur="3.66">about Schneiderman here Schneiderman</text>
  <text start="771.66" dur="3.719">Schneiderman who ran the Clinton</text>
  <text start="773.459" dur="3.36">campaign in New York never had the guts</text>
  <text start="775.379" dur="2.76">to bring this ridiculous case which</text>
  <text start="776.819" dur="7.171">lingered in their office for almost two</text>
  <text start="778.139" dur="6.961">years and this was talking about doing</text>
  <text start="783.99" dur="4.469">everything they can to sue me on a</text>
  <text start="785.1" dur="6.78">foundation that took in 18 million phony</text>
  <text start="788.459" dur="7.411">crime collusion with Russians whatever</text>
  <text start="791.88" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;ve covered Schneiderman all right let</text>
  <text start="795.87" dur="2.94">me get up here it disguise just</text>

  <text start="845.07" dur="4.26">down and allow himself to be put in that</text>
  <text start="847.44" dur="5.88">position because Trump&amp;#39;s are all about</text>
