  <text start="3.149" dur="4.201">little bit under the weather and I think</text>
  <text start="4.95" dur="6.479">in a earlier video I cut I think I</text>
  <text start="7.35" dur="5.61">called rod Rosenstein Rob I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="11.429" dur="3.391">making a couple other errors like that</text>
  <text start="12.96" dur="3.39">so if you&amp;#39;ve caught a couple of them</text>
  <text start="14.82" dur="5.73">please correct them in the comments</text>
  <text start="16.35" dur="5.4">otherwise just roll with me it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="2.28">odd some of this stuff is a lot to take</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="1.769">in it&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve read about</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="2.67">some of it</text>
  <text start="23.519" dur="3.301">so today the big stories on the dredge</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="3.18">report are about the Mueller</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="4.98">investigation starting to run down and</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="5.37">then I did have I just was talking about</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="6.96">John Kerry and he popped up again so</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="7.079">this guy is in nobody and you know I</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="4.11">can&amp;#39;t figure out well I mean I know why</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="3.66">we all know why he&amp;#39;s around he&amp;#39;s a deep</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="3.209">state shill he&amp;#39;s a puppet you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="44.789" dur="5.131">part of the problem that we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="7.32">clean up but the headline is Kerry</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="7.799">quietly seeking to salvage Iran deal he</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="9.3">helped craft so the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="6.391">has set a may 12 line I guess for</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="3.121">issuing their statement on whether or</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="3.27">not we&amp;#39;re gonna stay inside of the Iran</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="6.54">nuclear deal or not</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="6.27">and everything looks like we&amp;#39;re not it</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="4.11">looks like we&amp;#39;re gonna step out of it</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="6.18">and redo it there&amp;#39;s some things that</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="7.88">have come to light about nuclear plants</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="7.77">Iranian nuclear plants in northern Syria</text>
  <text start="84.35" dur="5.82">parts of uranium one going through Iran</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="6.12">and ending up in Syria for that program</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="6.25">so there&amp;#39;s lots of things to be kind of</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="4.53">kept in motion the thing that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="3.269">worried about is the Israeli strikes in</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="3.75">Syria it doesn&amp;#39;t look like we have</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="5.671">control of that and it&amp;#39;s easy to confuse</text>
  <text start="102" dur="6.77">that with what we meaning the Trump</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="5.399">administration is out to accomplish so</text>
  <text start="108.77" dur="3.7">you know I think it&amp;#39;s important to look</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.781">at that through the lens of what we have</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.649">to do versus what we can say we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="4.259">and then we got this guy to deal with</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.221">you know so that&amp;#39;s John Kerry guys</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="2.541">popping up</text>
  <text start="122.01" dur="7.11">okay so he&amp;#39;s talking to the Iranians</text>
  <text start="124.7" dur="6.49">speaking with an Iranian official and</text>
  <text start="129.12" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s trying to discuss ways to preserve</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="4.89">the pact limiting Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="7.5">program which looks like it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="5.91">meant to arm Iran you know so it goes on</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="3.78">to say that Kerry has been on an</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="6.74">aggressive yet stealthy mission stealthy</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="7.98">mission using his deep lists of contacts</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="5.47">gleaned during his time as a top US</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="4.08">diplomat to try to apply pressure to the</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="5.58">Trump administration from outside and</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="5.69">it&amp;#39;s hemp to preserve it so he was</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.28">trying to preserve the Iran nuclear deal</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="5.29">now what kind of got my interest down</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="5.1">here was there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="4.23">picture of Netanyahu right this is the</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="3.51">Prime Minister it&amp;#39;s like the President</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="3.96">of Israel and there&amp;#39;s this guy behind</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="3.18">him and I have seen this before I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="2.96">seen this picture but I didn&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="6.93">it was</text>
  <text start="178.58" dur="7.69">well it turns out that this is the</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.83">founder of modern-day Zionism which I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="5.189">been talking about his name is Theodore</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="7.349">Herzl he&amp;#39;s considered the founder of the</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="7.351">modern Zionist movement in his 1896 book</text>
  <text start="195.959" dur="4.591">dour Juden stott he envisioned the</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="4.26">founding of a future independent Jewish</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="8.48">state during the 20th century which came</text>
  <text start="203.07" dur="5.96">to pass you know about 50 years later I</text>
  <text start="209.3" dur="3.31">found this to be very interesting so</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;ll leave the links here you can come</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="5.879">read about Zionism at least as far as</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="7.56">Wikipedia it states it so I was reading</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="6.151">about this DAR Juden stat and it had</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="6.93">some really interesting stuff his take</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="6.38">on the Jewish position in the world was</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="9.3">interesting it was written in German and</text>
  <text start="231.02" dur="14.2">published in Austria and where was it</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="8.31">that I says after centuries or is a</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="3.17">summary after centuries of various</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.889">restrictions hostilities and frequent</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="5.77">pogroms the Jews of Europe have been</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="4.261">reduced to living in ghettos the higher</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="3.54">class is forced to deal with</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="4.38">angry mobs and so experiences a great</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="4.289">deal of discomfort the lower-class lives</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="4.14">in despair middle-class professionals</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="6.18">are distrusted and the statement don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="6.66">buy from Jews causes much anxiety among</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.891">Jewish people it is reasonable to assume</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="4.17">that the Jews will not be left in peace</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.8">neither a change in the feelings of</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="4.95">non-jews nor a movement to merge into</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="7.11">the surrounds of Europe offers much hope</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="8.42">to the Jewish people okay so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="7.62">basically saying wherever the Jews go</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="7.03">people don&amp;#39;t like them there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="5.49">explanation of why that is and why it</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="6.39">happens everywhere they go in masse</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="5.49">across different populations but he does</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="3.96">go on to talk about this now this is the</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="5.9">part I found interesting this is a quote</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="7.74">okay so this is the founder of Zionism</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="4.72">this is his quote he says the Jewish</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="4.41">Question</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="8.22">okay the JQ persists what wherever Jews</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="6.24">live in appreciable numbers okay so</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="4.05">right there he&amp;#39;s saying wherever there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="3.75">enough of them to establish their own</text>
  <text start="326.46" dur="3.84">little group their own little</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="3.869">neighborhood you know wherever they</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="4.619">wherever they can get a cultural</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="5.101">foothold you know where they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="4.051">to integrate wherever they can amass</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="6.959">themselves and get a cultural foothold</text>
  <text start="338.97" dur="6.78">you get it that&amp;#39;s the first sentence he</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="3.091">says the Jewish Question will persist</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="3.96">wherever they live in appreciable</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="4.469">numbers so wherever their culture can</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="5.13">get a foothold the Jewish Question will</text>
  <text start="351.539" dur="8.461">come up he goes on to say wherever it</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="8.37">does not exist it is brought in together</text>
  <text start="360" dur="5.55">with the Jewish immigrants so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="4.05">saying if it doesn&amp;#39;t exist somewhere if</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="3.27">no one&amp;#39;s ever heard of it if no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="4.14">ever had a problem with the Jews they</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="5.46">will have a problem once the Jews show</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="7.16">up this is the founder of Zionism</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="6.93">Theodor Herzl this is his own words he</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="5.05">goes on to say we are naturally drawn</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="4.65">into those places where we are not</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.98">persecuted meaning places where Jews</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="4.77">have never been okay and</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="5.66">our appearance there gives a rise to</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="5.73">persecution that&amp;#39;s a second point</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="3.61">wherever it doesn&amp;#39;t exist that we</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="5.07">brought in with Jewish immigrants you</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="6.3">get it so basically he&amp;#39;s admitting</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="4.47">straight up we&amp;#39;re gonna be based on the</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="7.14">way our culture set up and the way we</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="8.97">behave as a group people are going to</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="6.66">hate us even if they don&amp;#39;t know who we</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="4.89">are so that takes the racism part out of</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="4.25">it and I think it undermines and takes</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="5.1">out neutralizes the anti-semitism</text>
  <text start="422.21" dur="6.37">conversation because the founder of the</text>
  <text start="424.86" dur="5.43">movement is admitting its behavior</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="3.54">people just don&amp;#39;t like our culture</text>
  <text start="430.29" dur="7.65">wherever we go you know people are gonna</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="6.78">end up revolting against us all right so</text>
  <text start="437.94" dur="5.22">this is the rest of his quote he says</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="8.07">this is the case and will inevitably be</text>
  <text start="443.16" dur="7.8">so everywhere even in a highly civilized</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="6.06">countries see for instance France so</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="7.94">long as the Jewish Question is not</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="9">solved on the political level so I</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="4.93">thought right I thought that like people</text>
  <text start="462.03" dur="4.26">like Adolf Hitler I thought that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="4.14">the Jewish Question came from but it</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="3.51">turns out like people were asking this</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="3.51">question far before that this is the</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="3.93">turn of the century back in the 1800s</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="4.77">and this is Theodore Herzl the founder</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="5.7">of modern Zionism which led to the</text>
  <text start="476.25" dur="4.62">formation of Israel okay now that</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s some interesting stuff in here</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="6.48">too so it goes on to say that so he</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="6.33">pitched this to the bankers the</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="5.88">Rothschilds right I said he opposed</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="5.31">Herzl a pros the opposed the efforts</text>
  <text start="493.23" dur="5.49">already made by Zionist groups to settle</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.64">Jews and Ottoman controlled Palestine by</text>
  <text start="498.72" dur="6.12">arguing that important experiments and</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="5.64">colonization have been made though on</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="4.74">the mistaken principle of a gradual</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="5.22">infiltration of Jews an infiltration is</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="4.26">bound to end badly it continues until</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="4.14">the inevitable moment when the native</text>
  <text start="513.84" dur="4.08">population feels itself threatened and</text>
  <text start="515.97" dur="4.35">forces the government to stop a further</text>
  <text start="517.92" dur="4.489">influx of Jews immigration is</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="4.999">consequently futile unless we have</text>
  <text start="522.409" dur="7.23">a sovereign right to continue such</text>
  <text start="525.319" dur="12">immigration now what does that sound</text>
  <text start="529.639" dur="9.901">like I mean that sounds like the 1965 or</text>
  <text start="537.319" dur="3.69">whatever Immigration Act that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="3.419">that sounds like that sounds like now</text>
  <text start="541.009" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re you can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t even enforce</text>
  <text start="542.959" dur="2.94">our border that&amp;#39;s what that sounds like</text>
  <text start="544.519" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s a sovereign right inside the</text>
  <text start="545.899" dur="7.201">judiciary the judgment system inside of</text>
  <text start="549.769" dur="6.151">a country the laws that enable all this</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="4.169">and once that happens there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="8.219">stop it and that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="557.269" dur="9.63">right here all right now to back up of</text>
  <text start="564.139" dur="8.731">this thing he says that there were</text>
  <text start="566.899" dur="8.391">efforts this is in 1896 ok 1896 and he</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="6.659">is saying that he opposes the efforts</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="9.45">already made by Zionist groups to settle</text>
  <text start="579.529" dur="5.211">Jews in Ottoman controlled Palestine</text>
  <text start="584.829" dur="6.221">which is exactly where Israel&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="587.269" dur="7.411">that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened and this is</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="11.67">in 1896 all right so a little bit after</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="12.12">that you get the Federal Reserve in 1913</text>
  <text start="602.72" dur="10.5">and then you get World War one six</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="8.219">months later July 1914 you get it you</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="5.549">get how quick this stuff works once you</text>
  <text start="615.019" dur="5.43">get it all in motion and then you get</text>
  <text start="618.769" dur="6">the defeat of the Ottoman Empire</text>
  <text start="620.449" dur="8.37">so the Ottoman Empire was Turkey okay</text>
  <text start="624.769" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s this is Turkey and it occupied a</text>
  <text start="628.819" dur="5.301">great deal of more territory so it</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="7.589">basically consumed the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="634.12" dur="6.63">this is where Israel&amp;#39;s at now so during</text>
  <text start="638.569" dur="6.661">World War one we defeated the Ottoman</text>
  <text start="640.75" dur="10.22">Empire as well so the Turks using the</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="7.93">Young Turk revolution with a two-stage</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="3.93">electoral system under the Ottoman</text>
  <text start="653.16" dur="3.87">Parliament so that&amp;#39;s what they that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.9" dur="4.59">what they move to but they use the Young</text>
  <text start="657.03" dur="6.92">Turk revolution to defeat the Ottoman</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="4.46">Empire during the World War one I guess</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="3.52">and this is linked everything this is</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="2.82">linked to everything in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="667.56" dur="4.86">and this is what set up the modern</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="5.01">Middle East layout this is what changed</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="9.68">the map and all the countries you have</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="9.72">now like Jordan Iraq I think so</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="3.61">interesting stuff if he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="683.82" dur="5.55">about it and this is what ended it</text>
  <text start="685.71" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s a Treaty of Lausanne I guess and</text>

  <text start="705.66" dur="4.29">believe that a wonderous generation of</text>
  <text start="707.46" dur="4.95">Jews will spring into existence the</text>
  <text start="709.95" dur="4.74">Mokka beans will rise again let me</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="5.24">repeat once more my opening words the</text>
  <text start="714.69" dur="9.71">Jews who wish for a state will have it</text>
  <text start="717.65" dur="6.75">okay and then what he did was he lobbied</text>

  <text start="740.4" dur="4.05">than the West Bank kind of thing where</text>
  <text start="741.96" dur="4.11">they just invade you know where they</text>
  <text start="744.45" dur="3.45">only sell does they only sell the Jews</text>

  <text start="747.9" dur="3.6">they buy up land from people and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.03" dur="3.15">another form of displacement and they</text>
  <text start="751.5" dur="3.87">they use that today that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.18" dur="5.25">happening in the West Bank but he was</text>
  <text start="755.37" dur="5.04">able and then whatever I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="758.43" dur="4.29">losing my train of thought here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.41" dur="5.34">it for now I mean this is this is a kind</text>
  <text start="762.72" dur="6.66">of an eye opener for me I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="765.75" dur="5.07">understand all this stuff this deep you</text>
  <text start="769.38" dur="3.42">know like Zionism isn&amp;#39;t it really</text>
  <text start="770.82" dur="4.95">something that we talk about very often</text>
  <text start="772.8" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s clearly in the open it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="775.77" dur="4.74">racist term it was founded by people</text>
  <text start="779.16" dur="5.04">that are well documented it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="780.51" dur="5.07">Wikipedia so I think that we should talk</text>
  <text start="784.2" dur="3">about this more because I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="785.58" dur="4.35">most people know about this stuff I</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="4.05">think most people just assume that we</text>
  <text start="789.93" dur="4.8">all get along with each other</text>
  <text start="791.25" dur="5.19">and it&amp;#39;s not true you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="794.73" dur="4.77">and there&amp;#39;s a certain group of people</text>
